SenatorWicker,Drivers in some parts of the country are paying more than $6.00 per gallon. What was previously unthinkable is now a troubling reality because of @user war on American energy. https://t.co/6jOY1AtvgJ
SenatorWicker,For far too long drivers along Highway 18 have faced delays because of the current rail crossing in Brandon. Improving this crossing will play a key role in reducing congestion improving safety and boosting commerce in Rankin County.https://t.co/CBUpfxvBni
SenatorWicker,As we honor our fallen heroes this Memorial Day we should remember John Melton a son of Mississippi and his crewmates at Pearl Harbor who did not live to see the day of victory and renewed peace. #WickerReport https://t.co/JuzogBhPex
SenatorWicker,My colleague @user is right. President Biden’s inadequate border security is causing harm not just in border states but across the country. https://t.co/qCUvDtgWf8
SenatorWicker,Barry Parker a Constituent Liaison in my Tupelo office has served in the Mississippi National Guard for 36 years. Barry deployed to Iraq twice in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and later to Kuwait in 2018. Thank you Barry for all that you do! #MilitaryAppreciationMonth http
SenatorWicker,As Congress considers this year’s National Defense Authorization Act we must address President Biden’s lackluster proposal. The threats from China Russia and elsewhere are growing too large and too quickly for the U.S. to be complacent.
SenatorWicker,Gas prices skyrocketed up to an average of $4.619 per gallon this weekend. This economy is not working for American families. https://t.co/W7vOP5IlCi
SenatorWicker,The attack on Pearl Harbor rallied millions to serve our country in uniform. Tragically many of them never came home. We continue to honor these fallen heroes and the many other Americans who paid the ultimate price for our freedom. #WickerReport https://t.co/2GgPrAlHXr
SenatorWicker,Incredibly President Biden today argued our economy was in “a position of strength.” But with continued pain at the pump sticker shock at the store and a looming summer of inflation the President seems increasingly out of touch.
SenatorWicker,For nearly 80 years John Melton’s body could not be identified at Pearl Harbor. Thanks to a recent military initiative he will soon be returned home to Mississippi for a final burial this summer. #WickerReport https://t.co/32jeo8mcQm
SenatorWicker,I enjoyed meeting with students from Germantown High School Laurel Christian High School and St. Andrews High School on the Capitol steps last week. They have a bright future ahead! http
SenatorWicker,On this #MemorialDay we should all take time to honor and remember the heroes who gave everything to defend our great nation. We owe them a debt that can never be repaid. http
SenatorWicker,The @user new abortion guidelines are preposterous. I joined my colleagues on a letter last week opposing the far-reaching guidelines for abortion the organization has proposed. https://t.co/Y1fPqPLkoY
SenatorWicker,Ukraine continues to inflict heavy damages against Russia’s invasion force. Vladimir Putin now must resort to deploying Soviet-era weapons to the fight. It is in the U.S. interest to help Ukraine continue to fight back. https://t.co/DLKKVcCWkz
SenatorWicker,This weekend is the Annual Blessing of the Fleet and Fais Do-Do in Biloxi. The ceremony has taken place since 1929 and now includes the Shrimp Queen pageant a seafood cookoff and awards for boat decoration. It is a great way to celebrate on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. http
SenatorWicker,Rural communities have a chronic shortage of specialty providers. The SPARC Act I introduced with @user would offer much-needed student loan relief for physicians and other medical professionals who serve in rural areas. https://t.co/1eFwMhdD6O
SenatorWicker,“The last thing we need is a tax hike on top of another spending blowout that slows economic growth grows public debt and makes managing it more difficult.” @user https://t.co/gfBqIDlRXa
SenatorWicker,Julian Carroll a Constituent Liaison in my Tupelo office faithfully served our country for 22 years as a Navy reservist deploying to Iraq Bosnia Iraq Ethiopia Somalia and Afghanistan and elsewhere during his tour of duty. Thank you Julian! #MilitaryAppreciationMonth http
SenatorWicker,Gas prices are soaring. Instead of correcting the problem my Democratic friends are trying to find a scapegoat by targeting small businesses and energy producers. http
SenatorWicker,President Biden’s defense budget is woefully inadequate – it is a blueprint for American decline. It is imperative Congress step in and take its role to provide for the common defense seriously.  http
SenatorWicker,.@POTUS insists he is taking the border crisis seriously but his deportation policy says otherwise. Under his leadership deportation of unlawful immigrants has dropped to 80 percent less than it was even during the Obama administration. Border officials need our support.
SenatorWicker,Border security is national security. It is time to enforce immigration laws and end incentives feeding this crisis. http
SenatorWicker,Sensible border policy is a priority for the American people. In a recent poll 55% of those interviewed opposed ending Title 42. Losing this policy without a plan to end this crisis would be a complete disaster. https://t.co/a8bHBkL8S2
SenatorWicker,Months of runaway inflation are beginning to put a massive dent in the financial well-being of American families. These are the results of @user radical economic agenda.
SenatorWicker,Americans did not endure two years of COVID just to end up losing our savings to inflation. would do us all a favor by doing some soul searching abandoning his far-left agenda and working with Republicans to fix our economy. #WickerReport  https://t.co/UYSNc4JNC1
SenatorWicker,With gas prices hitting record highs instead of reckoning with how Democrats’ anti-domestic energy policies are contributing to this crisis President Biden is looking for a scapegoat.   https://t.co/IPlHo9fSSS
SenatorWicker,I am blessed to have several veterans serving on my staff. I extend a special thanks this #MilitaryAppreciationMonth to my national security adviser Pat Thompson. Pat served from 2011-2021 in the U.S. Army Reserve including a deployment to  Afghanistan in 2014. Thank you Pat. http
SenatorWicker,It is no surprise that 92% of Americans are concerned about the price of gas. With costs above $4 per gallon in every state  American families are feeling the pain at the pump. http
SenatorWicker,@user @user As I wrote in @user last week bringing these two countries into NATO would strengthen the alliance and help reduce reliance on the U.S. https://t.co/TAeNPqN08B
SenatorWicker,The Mississippi delegation stands behind @user and its expansion. I joined @user on a resolution urging the accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO without delay. https://t.co/9TnN4nPlTb
SenatorWicker,.@POTUS’ border crisis has spurred a wave of drug overdose deaths. His failure to stop fentanyl at the Southern border will cause lasting harm. http
SenatorWicker,It was great to see NATO Secretary General @user last weekend. We discussed how to make the alliance stronger including adding Finland and Sweden. Our bipartisan delegation sent an unmistakable signal of American support for NATO. http
SenatorWicker,The attack in Uvalde Texas was abhorrent. We all share the heartache for our friends in Texas. http
SenatorWicker,.@POTUS’ failed policies have led to the worst border crisis in U.S. history. Now the American people are paying the price. http
