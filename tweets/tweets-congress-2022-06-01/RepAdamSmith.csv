RepAdamSmith,I am grateful to @user and @user for the work they are doing in our region to provide affordable homeownership opportunities to the underserved members of our community.
RepAdamSmith,Across the country we are experiencing a shortage of housing supply especially here in the Puget Sound Region. I talked with staff about the urgent need for federal legislation to address this crisis and ways to direct more funding to high-cost markets like Seattle.
