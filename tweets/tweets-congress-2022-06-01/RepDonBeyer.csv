RepDonBeyer,My colleague from Georgia is espousing a wildly stupid conspiracy theory that Canadian PM Justin Trudeau is the son of Fidel Castro because Trudeau's mother visited Cuba years after he was born. http Republicans ran the House she'd be making policy today. http
RepDonBeyer,New @user Editorial proposes what Virginia should pay to finance construction of a football stadium for a billionaire-owned team: :https://t.co/4pqnqkCmi8 http
RepDonBeyer,"17 mass shootings in America ***since Uvalde***.The cynical politicians who say it is ""too soon"" to talk about commonsense gun safety reforms after a mass shooting are absolutely wrong.It isn't too soon it's too late for the people we lost. http"
RepDonBeyer,"If you want to ban abortion without exceptions for a mother's safety don't support paid leave better maternity care or improving access to baby formula and adamantly oppose reforms to prevent mass shootings at schools... I just don't think it's honest to call that ""pro-life."""
RepDonBeyer,My thanks to those who served and those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. We honor them on #MemorialDay and everyday and keep their families in our hearts. May all of us cherish our freedom and remember its cost. http
RepDonBeyer,The alternative to preventing a crime before the law is broken - in this case a massacre of young children in their elementary school - is just letting it happen http
RepDonBeyer,"""...and I will personally stop anyone from trying to prevent it from happening again."" http"
RepDonBeyer,Keep coming back to this. http
RepDonBeyer,“More children die by gunfire in a year than on-duty police officers and active military members.” http
RepDonBeyer,Good news– the Justice Department just announced they will investigate the law enforcement incident response in Uvalde. Update here:https://t.co/e78uWeVrW3 http
RepDonBeyer,"The point of ""door control"" is the same as ""arm teachers"" or ""mental health"" – they don't really believe these things will solve the problem the point is to distract us. It's Republican Politicianese for ""hey look over there!""Stay focused: the problem is the guns. http"
RepDonBeyer,Many strong pieces of @user executive actions on policing but I'm thrilled to see the directive mandating adoption of body-worn cameras for federal law enforcement. @user and I have worked to achieve this with legislation and advocacy for years a big step forward. http
RepDonBeyer,Ted Cruz is the U.S. Senator for Texas he has surely been briefed by law enforcement by now and must know how absurdly stupid it is to say this about the Uvalde shooting http
RepDonBeyer,Today the people who claim to be the proudest American exceptionalists are the ones saying there is literally nothing we can do to keep our children from being massacred in schools.A thing that doesn't happen anywhere else they're saying we shouldn't even try to stop it here. http
RepDonBeyer,Donald Trump is speaking at the NRA convention in Texas three days after the school shooting in Uvalde. So far he has criticized support for Ukraine and said we should cancel funding to prevent the spread of Covid then use that money to put more guns in schools across the US. http
RepDonBeyer,@user Congratulations!!
RepDonBeyer,We keep getting conflicting official accounts about what happened during the mass shooting in Uvalde that resulted in 19 children and 2 teachers killed.I join those urging the Justice Department to open an investigation into the law enforcement response to establish the truth.
RepDonBeyer,I don’t know how you watch this and conclude that flooding American communities with weapons of war designed for the battlefield is not a huge deadly problem — including for police — or that the solution is “a good guy with a gun.” The people saying that could not be more wrong.
RepDonBeyer,"""Like many school systems across the country the school district in Uvalde Texas put in place a plethora of recommended safety practices meant in part to deter school shootings. But they were of little use on Tuesday when a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers..."" http"
RepDonBeyer,But the simple truth here that none of these opponents of gun safety reforms can get away from is that we don't have a monopoly on mental illness we just have vastly more mass shootings and especially school shootings than other countries.And we know why. It's the guns.
RepDonBeyer,Mental health IS a real challenge. I talk about it often. I talked about it during the House Sit-In to prevent gun violence that John Lewis led six years ago.Over half of US gun deaths are suicides; over half of suicides involve guns. Our gun problem fuels our suicide problem.
RepDonBeyer,They don't really care about mental health they just use it as a dodge to take the focus off guns.Look at it this way: every country in the world has people suffering from mental illness. We don't have 100 times more mental illness in America. What we have is lots of guns.
RepDonBeyer,They scapegoat people who commit a tiny fraction of our country's gun violence. In the process they scapegoat people with mental illness which is awful.If you look you'll often find these exact same lawmakers vote AGAINST mental health resources and even vote to cut them.
RepDonBeyer,"A word about mental health.I work on mental health all the time in Congress. I cofounded the House Suicide Prevention Task Force. I've written and passed bills.Few of those who talk about ""mental health"" after mass shootings - for instance right now - actually care about it."
RepDonBeyer,Educators are supposed to help our kids learn to inspire them and help them grow. Our schools are supposed to be places of learning not fortresses.Teachers should not have to be first responders.
RepDonBeyer,Something I'm thinking about as we learn more about this shooting: Congress' failure to do anything about gun violence is putting teachers across the country - a profession that is already terribly undervalued - into a horribly dangerous position. It's absolutely unacceptable.
RepDonBeyer,"A fourth-grader at Robb Elementary says ""his teachers Irma Garcia and Eva Mireles saved [the] lives"" of himself and other children who survived the shooting.These teachers were heroes and all of us should remember and honor them. https://t.co/iezhsP6y8T"
RepDonBeyer,We must prevent police misconduct while protecting the public and building healthier communities. I will keep pushing for the George Floyd Justice In Policing Act to advance that goal.I also introduced the Cost of Police Misconduct Act a reform to boost local accountability: http
RepDonBeyer,The death of George Floyd two years ago was an agonizing moment for our country. @user actions to improve accountability for police misconduct while boosting transparency and support for officer wellness represent an approach that supports police by improving community trust. http
RepDonBeyer,"When I took office the federal Extreme Risk Protection Order (""red flag"") bill had 4 cosponsors. I was #5.The legislation evolved but the principle is still removing access to guns - with due process - from those who pose a threat to themselves or others.We're getting a vote: http"
RepDonBeyer,"Republican Senator asked why people need AR-15's: ""There's no answer to that"" http"
RepDonBeyer,"Some of my colleagues are saying they oppose gun safety reforms because ""criminals won't obey them.""  That isn't an argument against gun laws – it's an argument against ALL laws. And it's utter nonsense."
RepDonBeyer,Good. http
RepDonBeyer,One clarification needed the bill referred to above as HR 1112 is renumbered HR 1446 in the current Congress; it's the Enhanced Background Checks Act @user legislation to close the Charleston loophole.Some more information about that bill: http
