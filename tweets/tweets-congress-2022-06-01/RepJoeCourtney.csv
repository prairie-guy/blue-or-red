RepJoeCourtney,The #Infrastructure Law is providing local towns with the federal funds they need to complete long-term economic development projects. Yesterday I visited Stafford where the town will use #IIJA funding to clean up the former Earl M. Witt Intermediate School for future use. http
RepJoeCourtney,My office was happy to help out back in 2019 when Morgan needed a little assistance navigating National Guard commitments with ECSU’s last World Series visit—read more here:https://t.co/5BuC2Y7E2W
RepJoeCourtney,Morgan Bolduk and #3 ECSU are back in the Division III World Series! This team has some serious talent and it’s great to see Morgan back on the mound after serving with our Army National Guard in Africa.https://t.co/FWBFm14lcY
RepJoeCourtney,Coffeehouses have become a great opportunity for eastern CT veterans to let each other know about the services and benefits that are available to them. If you're a veteran in CT-02 reach out to my office to learn more about the services provided by the federal government.
RepJoeCourtney,Yesterday I stopped by the Windham Veterans' Coffeehouse in Storrs and had the honor of presenting WWII Veteran Paul Panagrosso and Vietnam Veterans Arthur Evans and Kenneth Tellier with medals recognizing their service to our country. http
RepJoeCourtney,This development means good-paying union jobs now and long-term economic growth down the road – all while supporting our transition away from fossil fuels.It was great to show @user the work we’re doing in New London. http
RepJoeCourtney,Wind energy is a key part of our green economy and at State Pier New London we’re building the future hub of our New England's offshore wind industry. http
RepJoeCourtney,I implore my Senate colleagues to pass the Enhanced Background Checks Act &amp; the Bipartisan Background Checks Act so we can take steps right now to curb these terrible acts of violence. #StopGunViolence
RepJoeCourtney,This Congress the House has passed two bills to expand #BackgroundChecks. Neither has received a vote in the Senate.We cannot ask America’s children to grow up like this or parents to live like this.
RepJoeCourtney,Today parents in Texas are experiencing the same anguish that our own neighbors in Newtown felt a decade ago. In the ten years that separates these tragedies not one meaningful bill has been signed into law that would make these mass shootings at least less-likely to occur.
