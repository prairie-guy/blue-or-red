RepEscobar,The @user Border Health Center would target at-risk communities develop better partnerships increase medical care for obesity diabetes and cancer and improve care on the border.That's why I'm proud to submit this as one of my 15 requests for community funding projects. http
RepEscobar,Today I visited @user the site for another community project funding request for a Senior Meal and Community Kitchen Project.The project would service 10k meals/day by building a full-scale kitchen for those in need. http
RepEscobar,This morning I toured the site for one of our community project funding requests in Horizon City.The funding for phase one of the city’s Transit-Oriented Development project would not only diversify the city’s tax base and revenues but make transit routes more accessible. http

RepEscobar,I'll believe Republicans will commit to joining us in enacting meaningful gun safety laws when I see it.Today I joined @user to discuss the challenges posed by Republican obstructionists. http
RepEscobar,Republican lawmakers like @user take no accountability for the consequences of their dangerous gun policies.We were promised meaningful action after the Walmart shooting in El Paso. They lied.https://t.co/UVLO0vghyq

RepEscobar,.@GregAbbott_TX assures us this is a mental health problem not a gun problem.At the same time he redirects $500 million from @user and @user which help fund mental health services.I promise you the gun lobby isn’t more important than our kids.https://t.co/cSuvcPZrZ1
