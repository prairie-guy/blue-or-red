SenMarkKelly,Who likes freshly repaved roadways? Or structurally sound bridges? How about reliable public transit? Our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests in all of these priorities to help Arizonans get around our state.
SenMarkKelly,Deploying more wind energy is an important step towards a more sustainable energy future. Congratulations to @user for being one of the universities leading the way.    https://t.co/S56Ghx8xD5
SenMarkKelly,Students here at @user are getting trained to take on high-paying jobs in Arizona's booming semiconductor industry. These are the jobs of the future and we're going to create a lot more of them once my plan to boost domestic microchip manufacturing is signed into law. http
SenMarkKelly,It's important that we come together and invest in the tools needed to take on Valley fever. I've introduced a bill in the Senate to support more research and the path to a vaccine for this health risk facing Arizonans.https://t.co/Cn8WValmAa
SenMarkKelly,Gas has become far too expensive for Arizona families. Washington needs to move quickly to increase domestic energy production and pass my bill eliminating the federal gas tax for the rest of the year. http
SenMarkKelly,Today is about honoring the brave servicemembers who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to this country. They gave their lives to protect our rights and freedoms. We'll always be indebted to them for their service. #MemorialDay
SenMarkKelly,The Wallow Fire started on May 29 2011 and went on to become the largest wildfire in Arizona history. The smoke was seen from space in this @user satellite image. We won't forget the heroism of the firefighters and the impacts felt in Alpine and the surrounding communities. http
SenMarkKelly,As a Senator and a Merchant Marine grad it’s an honor to nominate Arizona's best and brightest for appointment to our service academies. I recently got to meet with this year's appointees where I thanked them for their willingness to serve and gave them a bit of advice. http
SenMarkKelly,He estado presionando a los fabricantes y a la administración para que actúen con urgencia para aumentar el suministro de fórmula infantil. Cualquier familia que necesite ayuda en este momento para encontrar fórmula para bebés debe visitarhttps://t.co/MDvM2ZUus6
SenMarkKelly,Called @user today to thank his officers for responding to the shooting in Uvalde. They put their lives at risk to protect their community and one of them was shot in the process. I’m grateful for their selfless service.
