RepLaMalfa,Water cuts to California farmers weakens our food supply and worsens shortages. Government needs to stop punishing producers who are making more food with less inputs than ever before. Increase water storage capacity roll back restrictions and deliver producers their water now.
RepLaMalfa,"Casting blame on ""Ultra-MAGA"" and other countries isn’t helping to fix inflation. President Biden must take accountability for his failed economic policies stop his out of control spending and repeal his restrictions on American energy producers – that’s how we combat inflation."
RepLaMalfa,To all those in uniform who fought bravely and died for our freedoms we salute you. #MemorialDay2022 http
RepLaMalfa,The average price for gas in California is well over $6 a gallon – the highest ever recorded in our nation. Governor Newsom must repeal his gas tax now.
RepLaMalfa,The price of gas has more than doubled in the last two years. The American people can’t afford to keep paying for these failed anti-domestic energy policies. We must bring back American energy independence now. http
RepLaMalfa,Thank you @user for leading this effort. Farmers are known stewards of the land and know how to care for all natural resources. They shouldn’t be bogged down with environmental regulations that do the opposite. http
RepLaMalfa,Wildfire survivors should not be asked to pay taxes on $ they will use to rebuild their lives. Glad to join up with @user on introducing H.R. 7305 to exempt Fire Victim Trust awardees from having to pay federal taxes on their settlement $.  http
RepLaMalfa,"We are seeing fires starting across the North State already. We must implement an aggressive approach to tree thinning debris removal &amp; putting out unplanned fires before they grow and get out of control. Our forests are too dry and overgrown to continue the ""let it burn"" policy"
