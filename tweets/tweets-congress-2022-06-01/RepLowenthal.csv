RepLowenthal,Nearly 4 in 10 U.S. adults report symptoms of anxiety or depression up from 1 in 10 pre-pandemic. This #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth check in on yourself &amp; the people you care about. You can find the warning signs of a mental health condition here: http
RepLowenthal,I’m deeply disappointed by a court decision halting the Biden admin’s ending of Title 42—a Trump-era public health order allowing expulsion of migrants. It denies legitimate asylum seekers a fair legal process &amp; no longer serves a public health rationale. It’s time to end it.
RepLowenthal,We’ll keep fighting to get the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act—which passed in the House--through the Senate. Systemic racism has plagued our nation since before its founding. It won’t be easy nor fast but we can overcome it. 2/2
RepLowenthal,This week marks 2 years since the murder of George Floyd. As we remember him let us recommit to the fight against systemic racism. Pres. Biden’s exec orders are a major step but there is far more to do. We need to make sure all communities live free from fear. 1/2
