SenAlexPadilla,Joined @user @user &amp; local leaders at St. Teresa of Calcutta Villa in San Diego to put forward solutions to address the affordable housing and homelessness crises.Homelessness in America *can* be solved and I‚Äôm fighting for a future of housing for all. http
SenAlexPadilla,Wildfires are getting worse and worse each year and as a result so is hazardous smoke pollution. We must take proactive action to keep all of our communities protected.I led my colleagues in requesting additional federal funds for wildfire smoke monitoring systems. ‚¨áÔ∏è http
SenAlexPadilla,We *know* the solutions needed to curb gun violence in America ‚Äî we just need to summon the will to take action.https://t.co/ttV8JT9Qmi
SenAlexPadilla,Honoring our nation‚Äôs fallen heroes at the San Francisco National Cemetery #MemorialDay ceremony. We are forever indebted to the brave service members who have laid down their lives for our country ‚Äì their sacrifice will not be forgotten. http
SenAlexPadilla,Great to meet with some of our spring 2022 interns and thank them for their work. They are talented passionate and have bright futures ahead. http
SenAlexPadilla,The threat from wildfires is constant and increasingly devastating not just in California but across the Western United States. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm introducing new legislation to put fires out faster &amp; protect communities from post-fire flooding. üëáüèΩhttps://t.co/L6sgziHqRN
SenAlexPadilla,Joined @user &amp; @user on Pod Save America to discuss the tragic Uvalde shooting and the common sense gun safety measures Congress must pass to save lives. ‚¨áÔ∏è http
SenAlexPadilla,Our message to our Republican colleagues today is clear: how is this acceptable?How are you not outraged?And NO more guns are not the answer. It‚Äôs commonsense gun reform. http
SenAlexPadilla,One year ago the San Jose community suffered the worst mass shooting in Bay Area history.Thinking of the victims and their families on this difficult day. How many more lives must be lost before we take action in Congress? http
SenAlexPadilla,As a father this is personal for me ‚Äî I refuse to sit idly by and watch our children die in schools because Republicans in Congress will not act.Proud to stand with my colleagues and advocates from @user @user and @user fighting for commonsense gun reform. http
SenAlexPadilla,It should be unthinkable that any Senator could vote against stopping domestic terrorism. We need to pass #DPTA to stand united against hate and the threat posed by violent white supremacists and other extremists.
SenAlexPadilla,Abortion is health care ‚Äî  and @user practice of unnecessarily collecting and retaining cell phone location records could serve as a tool for extremists targeting people seeking reproductive care. Google must protect this sensitive information. http
SenAlexPadilla,For decades @user has served as the world‚Äôs strongest political-military alliance protecting freedom and democracy around the world. I joined my colleagues in affirming our bipartisan support for Sweden and Finland to be expeditiously admitted.https://t.co/rEJA1uMUSd
SenAlexPadilla,Two years after a police officer murdered George Floyd police accountability for disproportionate use of force against Black &amp; Brown Americans is far too rare. We must continue the fight to honor his life by passing the meaningful reforms necessary to keep our communities safe.
SenAlexPadilla,This is a commonsense approach to help us stay one step ahead of wildfires and help prevent catastrophic losses that we‚Äôve become too familiar with during fire seasons. Glad to join @user in supporting our firefighters and protecting our communities. http
