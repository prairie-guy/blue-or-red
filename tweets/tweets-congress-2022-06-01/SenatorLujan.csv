SenatorLujan,Happy Pride Month! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 It’s a privilege to be an ally to the LGBTQ+ community here in DC and at home in New Mexico. I hope everyone has a joy-filled month and remembers that you’re not alone in the fight to love who you love. #pride
SenatorLujan,As a part of this effort I co-led legislation last week that would eliminate the VA Air Commission which has been making these closure recommendations using pre-pandemic inaccurate information that does not accurately reflect the current state and needs of the VA.
SenatorLujan,I want to thank every veteran who joined me yesterday in Gallup to discuss the VA's recent recommendation to close clinics which would be detrimental to veteran health care. I value our partnership and I'll continue fighting against these recommended closures. http
SenatorLujan,Last week I surveyed Gallinas Watershed &amp; the damage done by the fires. Accompanied by members of the state legislature we talked about the assistance that is already helping NMs recover and the local &amp; federal assistance still needed like my Hermit’s Peak Fire Assistance Act. http
SenatorLujan,Make sure you know your rights.Title IX: “No person in the United States shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
SenatorLujan,On the 50th anniversary of #TitleIX it’s so important to recognize how far our country has come in gender-based discrimination and violence and recommit to taking action when you see or experience gender-based discrimination.
SenatorLujan,I’m hosting a Veterans’ Listening Session this afternoon in Gallup NM to discuss the VA’s recommendation to close veteran health care clinics in NM and across the country. Open to the public! Details below⬇️ http
SenatorLujan,🇺🇸 http
SenatorLujan,It’s always an honor to return to my alma mater Pojoaque Valley HS and speak to the next generation of graduating leaders. New Mexico’s future is very bright. ☀️ http
SenatorLujan,Today I met with local leaders in Mora to coordinate more help for New Mexicans who are recovering from devastating wildfires. NMs deserve a robust coordinated response from elected leaders which is why my staff and I have been in contact with folks on the ground since Day 1. http
SenatorLujan,WATCH: Yesterday I questioned @user on the USDA’s commitment to help New Mexicans maintain our way of life which has been severely impacted by the wildfires in our state. http
SenatorLujan,The Hermit’s Peak Fire was started by a controlled burn however historic dry conditions and severe drought have significantly contributed to its spread. This is evidence of climate change right before our eyes and we have to address it before it's really too late.
SenatorLujan,It’s important now more than ever to stand united against white supremacy and domestic terrorism. I’m ashamed that so many of my GOP colleagues could not resoundingly reject hate today and vote for the #DTPA that would protect our communities from more hate-fueled violence.
SenatorLujan,This thread from former President @user two years ago is worth giving a second read today. Very powerful and poignant. http
SenatorLujan,It’s been 2 years since George Floyd was murdered.Since then we’ve marched.We’ve organized.We’ve raised public awareness.But it won’t be over until we make the institutional changes so every Black person doesn’t feel afraid to get pulled over or sleep in their own bed. http
SenatorLujan,After each mass shooting the GOP distracts from the real issue &amp; points to mental health. We’re no worse in mental health rates than any other nation. 90% of the country want background checks &amp; 85% want red-flag laws.Right now we need to abolish the filibuster &amp; pass H.R. 8.
