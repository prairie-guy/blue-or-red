RepMaxineWaters,I joined in the Memorial Day commemoration of 1.1 million servicemen &amp; women who have made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our country. We must avoid increasing the number of men &amp; women who die in war. Our goal must be the pursuit of diplomacy and peace not war and death.
RepMaxineWaters,How long will we have to endure the destruction of innocent lives by the people we pay to protect and serve us? This disregard for human life cannot continue. The people of the US must demand a stop to this carnage.
RepMaxineWaters,Despite George Floyd being killed with a cop's knee on his neck for 9 minutes 2 years ago the killing of unarmed young Blacks &amp; Latinos in particular continues. The US Senate failed to support police reform. We will continue to fight for justice &amp; the elimination of racist cops.
