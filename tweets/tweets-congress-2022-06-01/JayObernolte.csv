JayObernolte,On this solemn day we pause and remember all those who gave their lives to protect us and the values we believe in. Freedom isn't free and today we remember the price paid by the men and women who sacrificed everything for that noble cause. http

JayObernolte,When I talk about our illegal marijuana grow problem it's often hard for my colleagues to understand just how big these grows are. This week's arrests concerning a 14000 sqft subterranean grow in Newberry Springs illustrate the scale of the problem. http
JayObernolte,Heather and I are praying for the town of Uvalde and the families of the young people lost to senseless violence yesterday. As parents we can only imagine the grief these families are feeling. Our hearts go out to those affected by this horrific tragedy.
