RepPressley,For too long U.S. policy toward Haiti has perpetuated anti-Blackness &amp; injustice.This #HaitianHeritageMonth we must reaffirm that Haitian Lives Matter &amp; pursue policies that reflect that truth.@KekeFleur &amp; I wrote about how we can do just that. http
RepPressley,I'm thinking of the parents in my district who are struggling with the cost of childcare baby formula rent and student loan payments.@POTUS can #CancelStudentDebt and deliver critical relief with the stroke of a pen.
RepPressley,Due to decades of policy violence and the failed War on Drugs the U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world.Congress has a moral obligation to reform the broken clemency system it built and end the mass incarceration that plagues our nation. http

RepPressley,Our reproductive rights are under attack &amp; anything that aids in punishing those who seek health care must be dismantled.That's why Google must stop collecting &amp; retaining location data that could identify &amp; prosecute people obtaining abortion care. http
RepPressley,Let's be clear: The majority of student debt is carried by people with zero or negative household wealth.The most efficient and impactful way to deliver this relief is for @user to #CancelStudentDebt with a flick of his pen.

RepPressley,ðŸš¨Oklahoma Republicans just enacted a bill to completely outlaw abortion care across the state.This is just the start of the domino effect we could see should Roe v. Wade fall.The cruelty is the point &amp; we must use every tool available to fight back.https://t.co/EMSWA4L5G5
RepPressley,With nearly half of Haitiâ€™s population facing severe hunger by next month we must act fast to ensure food security on the island.Proud to join @user &amp; colleagues in urging @user to distribute emergency food aid to Haiti swiftly &amp; equitably.https://t.co/w9EnzaG8qO

RepPressley,With 3 people killed every day at the hands of police we need bold comprehensive legislative action.The Senate must end the Jim Crow filibuster so we can pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and Congress must take up my legislation to #EndQualifiedImmunity.
RepPressley,@user calls to reimagine crisis response study the impact of police violence on communities &amp; mitigate the spread of COVID behind the wall are a step forward &amp; will save lives. We've fought hard for this &amp; I look forward to working with the @user to build on this work.
RepPressley,Two years ago today George Floyd was murdered in an act of brazen police violence. Two years later our racist legal system remains deeply unjust &amp; continues to perpetuate brutality &amp; oppression over the safety and well-being of our communities. ðŸ§µ
RepPressley,Firearms are now the leading cause of death among children in this country.This is a choice. Every vote against gun reform is a choice.These massacres are preventable.
