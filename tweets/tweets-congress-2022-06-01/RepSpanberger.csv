RepSpanberger,I am proud to share that — less than 3 weeks after reaching $16 million — my office has returned $17 MILLION in federal benefits to Virginians.We are committed to securing every backlogged veterans benefit Medicare appeal and Social Security check owed to residents of #VA07. http
RepSpanberger,One week ago 19 kids and two teachers were massacred with an assault-style rifle — which the murderer bought legally at 18.So much needs to change.We can start with:✅ Raising the age to purchase military-style weapons to 21✅ Reinstating the ban on high-capacity magazines
RepSpanberger,Child nutrition waivers have helped feed thousands of Virginia students.⏱ But they are set to expire one month from today.Time is running out to pass my bipartisan bill to give @user the authority to extend these waivers and feed students through the upcoming school year.
RepSpanberger,The House and Senate must vote on bills to permit Extreme Risk Protective Orders prohibit large capacity magazines and raise the age at which one can purchase assault-style weapons.These bills would meaningfully impact our ability to save lives across the United States. (3/3)
RepSpanberger,As we remember past mass shootings and reflect on the murders in Buffalo and Uvalde the Senate must vote on the Bipartisan Background Check Act and to close the Charleston Loophole. (2/3)
RepSpanberger,It has been three years since 12 people were shot and killed at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center.Today we remember the lives lost and the families forever changed.Congress must vote on bills to address the scourge of gun violence in our communities. (1/3)
RepSpanberger,This Memorial Day across Virginia and the nation we remember and honor the names stories and legacies of the American servicemembers who gave their lives to preserve our freedoms.I am forever grateful for the heroism of these brave men and women. http
RepSpanberger,This week @user @user @user and @user introduced the companion to my bill named for retired Virginia police officer Wally Bunker.We are building on our bipartisan push to protect a key tax benefit for our retired officers and firefighters. http
RepSpanberger,A teacher told me “I see the fear in my students’ eyes. They have so much courage but they shouldn’t need courage to walk into their classroom.”I agree with her which is why I’m urging my colleagues to act. There are popular commonsense steps we can take to save lives. http
RepSpanberger,I continue to hear from parents about how the baby formula shortage is impacting them.While we must understand how to prevent a similar crisis in the future supply chain issues are hurting families now.I'll continue to treat solving this problem as the priority that it is. http
RepSpanberger,Reinstate the ban on high-capacity magazines.Raise the minimum purchasing age for military-style assault weapons to 21.These are concrete actions that would directly save lives. There are no excuses. We must take action.More with @user http
RepSpanberger,We are long overdue for serious legislation to prevent gun violence in our communities.Virginia has shown how we can enact commonsense gun laws. It is time for the federal government to follow suit. (5/5)
RepSpanberger,I’ve also cosponsored legislation related to Extreme Risk Protection Orders or “red flag laws.”The House intends to take up legislation on these orders and I hope my colleagues will consider how these measures can save the lives of those in crisis and those around them. (4/5)
RepSpanberger,When similar provisions were in place from 1994 to 2004 mass shootings declined by 37%.Once they expired gun massacres increased by 183% killing Americans of all ages at school church the grocery store concerts night clubs — anywhere people gather in community. (3/5)
RepSpanberger,This bill the Assault Weapons Ban defines the types of weapons that are manufactured for the quick killing of people and the legislation explicitly exempts more than 2200 guns that are used for hunting home defense or recreation. The bill also limits magazine capacity. (2/5)
RepSpanberger,Without concrete action the cycle of mass carnage in this country will go unbroken.We need to move towards reinstating a ban on the manufacturing sale and transfer of military-style assault weapons currently on the market.Let me introduce you to H.R. 1808. (1/5)
RepSpanberger,Outrageously these efforts have stalled in the U.S. Senate.These efforts are broadly popular across the political spectrum. The Senate could enact these laws right now if Senate Republicans wanted to show concern for the desperate outcries from America’s communities. (5/5)
RepSpanberger,Closing this loophole would not only help protect our communities but it would also protect the federal agents who are responsible for reclaiming the weapons sold to people who should have failed a background check via this loophole before their check could be completed. (4/5)
RepSpanberger,This second piece of legislation would close the “Charleston Loophole” which allowed the Mother Emanuel Church murderer to purchase a firearm despite being prohibited by law. (3/5)
RepSpanberger,The House has also voted twice in support of the Enhanced Background Checks Act to extend the period that law enforcement has to complete background checks for the small percentage of individuals who are not cleared within minutes of submitting a background check. (2/5)
RepSpanberger,Here is what we could do right now:The House has voted twice now to pass the Bipartisan Background Checks Act to ensure existing laws meant to keep guns out of the hands of those with a history of violence are being enforced including for sales online and at gun shows. (1/5)
RepSpanberger,As Americans grapple with the reality that 19 kids and two teachers were slaughtered in a classroom they are looking for what concrete actions we will take to save lives.Unfortunately here's how Senate Republicans feel about House-passed steps that could be taken now: http
RepSpanberger,Endemic mass shootings are unique to the United States.The problem is about access to assault weapons.It is time to get serious about protecting America’s children — and all Americans — from gun violence.
RepSpanberger,The sad reality is that requiring would-be mass murderers to reload saves lives — permitting people escape time and law enforcement response time.This is why I support legislation to limit magazine capacity. (3/3)
RepSpanberger,That provision was part of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban which expired in 2004.Large capacity magazines equate to more fatalities when a would-be shooter can fire shot after shot.Research confirms that limiting magazine capacity saves lives. (2/3)
RepSpanberger,When I began as a federal agent I carried a gun and two extra magazines every day.My mags were marked “for law enforcement use only” because they held more than 10 rounds. At that time federal law limited magazine capacity to 10 rounds outside of law enforcement use. (1/3)
RepSpanberger,The federal purchasing age for handguns is 21.The federal purchasing age for assault rifles is 18.Both the Uvalde and Buffalo shooters bought their assault weapons at 18.Raising this age is a first step to protecting lives and establishing parity in federal firearms law.
RepSpanberger,We must pass commonsense data-driven legislation to save lives — background checks Extreme Risk Protection Orders and magazine capacity limits.
RepSpanberger,As a mother my heart aches for the families whose babies did not come home last night.For the parents who received the worst news they will ever hear. For the parents who had to identify the mutilated body of their child.Our kids deserve better and that means real action.
