RepBonnie,This year the U.S. has averaged more than one mass shooting a day.Ignoring this crisis only begets more suffering. When will enough be enough?Inaction is indefensible. The Senate must end the filibuster pass the House's *bipartisan* background checks bill and save lives. http
RepBonnie,Happy #PrideMonth!Pride is not only a time for celebration but also a reminder that EVERYONE has the right to exist as their authentic selves.As a member of @user I am committed to fighting for full equality for the LGBTQ+ community — this month and always. http
RepBonnie,17 mass shootings SINCE UVALDE. It's only been a week.We cannot keep living like this nor can we normalize this senseless violence. This is a uniquely American epidemic.The Senate MUST pass the House's commonsense background checks bill. Human lives are at stake. http
RepBonnie,On this day in 1921 white supremacists massacred hundreds of Black residents and burned down more than 1250 homes in Tulsa Oklahoma. Today we remember and honor the victims.Only through knowing the full honest truth of our nation’s history can we prevent future tragedy. http
RepBonnie,On #MemorialDay we remember and honor those who gave everything in service of our country.Today and every day we thank veterans and current service members for their sacrifice.
RepBonnie,Once again the GOP will discuss anything *except* the leading cause of death in children. Legislation like the BIPARTISAN House-passed background checks bill would address the problem.Children have the right to feel safe at school. You cannot argue against this in good faith. http
RepBonnie,Our children are showing more leadership than the U.S. Senate.#GunControlNow http
RepBonnie,#NoBillNoBreak http
RepBonnie,Whether it be mental health care (something in which they have no interest in investing) or something as irrelevant as the number of doors in schools GOP politicians will talk about anything *except* addressing the leading cause of death in children.ANYTHING. http
RepBonnie,Doing nothing is a political choice too.
RepBonnie,Putting more guns in schools is *not* the solution to gun violence in schools. It's beyond disappointing that I have to say this.The solution to this uniquely American problem is commonsense gun control legislation like the background checks bill the House passed last year. http
RepBonnie,Marco Rubio doesn't like to talk about common sense gun control despite the support of 90% of Americans.But he has no problem with gunfire being the leading cause of death for U.S. children. http
RepBonnie,When car crashes were the leading cause of death for children we passed laws to make cars safer.Today gun violence is the leading cause of death for children. The House has passed a commonsense universal background checks bill. Time for the Senate to do its job.
RepBonnie,.@GregAbbott_TX b/c of your lies hypocrisy and cowardice parents across your state are keeping their children home out of fear for their safety. http
