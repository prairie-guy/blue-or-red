SenLummis,There is a compassionate way to address the crisis at the border but removing border protections isn’t it.
SenLummis,$60 billion collapse of major cryptocurrency is not the industry's Bear Stearns moment — senators and regulators explain why http
SenLummis,Digital assets are changing the game and Congress needs to keep up if we’re going to continue to be the global financial leader. If you missed the panel I did at @user with @user and @user you can catch it here: http
SenLummis,On this Memorial Day may we stop and honor those who have given their lives to defend our great nation. I am taking an extra moment to remember Rylee McCollum a marine from Jackson WY who gave his life for his country in Afghanistan last August. http
SenLummis,I am working diligently with @user to finalize bill text of our comprehensive digital asset legislation. Any language circulating online is an incredibly outdated version from March 1. Stay tuned for our release of the actual bill on June 7th!
SenLummis,May is Military Appreciation Month and I want to take this opportunity to honor those across Wyoming who have dedicated their lives and sometimes given their lives to defend our great country. http
SenLummis,Instead of honoring our servicemembers as we head into the Memorial Day weekend Senate Democrats tried to pass a bill that accuses our military and federal law enforcement of being white supremacists and neo-Nazis. This is shameful.https://t.co/6pv66mOKnZ
SenLummis,I enjoyed my time with the folks at @user last week. Digital assets are here to stay and it’s high time that Congress catches up. Hear more about the framework @user and I are developing in this discussion. https://t.co/Xzf02OUSmf
SenLummis,The EPA continues to attack WY's energy industry. This in turn will raise gas prices and harm families across WY and the nation. Joe Goffman authored the Clean Power Plan under Obama and has been actively trying to implement the damaging regional haze rules under this admin. http
SenLummis,My state policy director @user will be at the Sublette County Chamber of Commerce to talk about digital assets and how Wyoming is leading in this emerging industry. If you can’t attend in person you can participate via zoom. Find out more here: http
SenLummis,The crisis at our southern border is still the top issue my constituents in Wyoming talk to me about. Border security is national security. It’s time to take this crisis seriously.
SenLummis,We’re setting records again but not for good reasons. The average price of gas in Wyoming is $4.30 up from $3.03 a year ago. It’s time to take up some of the legislation that my colleagues and I have introduced that would help ease this burden on people in Wyoming. http
SenLummis,Did you know that my website has a grant guide for Wyoming businesses? Businesses communities and non-profits may be eligible for grants through a variety of federal programs. Find more information at http
