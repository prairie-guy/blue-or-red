RepRoKhanna,Happy Pride Month! Let’s take this opportunity to celebrate LGBTQI+ communities and continue fighting to protect human rights and equality for all.
RepRoKhanna,If the minimum wage kept up with the pace of productivity since the late 1960s it would be over $20/hr. Let's give Americans a livable wage. http
RepRoKhanna,I’m grateful for their work to address hunger in Silicon Valley and I will continue working to secure $10 million in funding for this project in FY23.
RepRoKhanna,I recently had the chance to visit @user Expanded Food Bank facilities in Alviso that will help make their efforts to provide healthy meals to our community more efficient and cost-effective. http
RepRoKhanna,Gun violence is an epidemic. The Senate needs to step up and take action. http
RepRoKhanna,Thanks to @user for bringing attention to these important issues during AANHPI Heritage Month. We must do all we can to combat discrimination and anti-Asian hate. http
RepRoKhanna,This is outrageous. We need to raise the wage and pass my bill with @user to tax Big Oil companies on their excess profits to give hardworking Americans a refund. http
RepRoKhanna,On Memorial Day we honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country and our founding ideals. In Congress let’s also continue working to do all we can to support veterans after their service.
RepRoKhanna,We can't stand by while kids are being put in harm’s way. Congress must act. @user http
RepRoKhanna,Broadband service has added to costs for Fremont's main streets and neighborhood commercial districts for too long.
RepRoKhanna,I’m working to secure $1500000 in funding for @user Commercial District Wi-Fi Access Expansion project in FY23 that will deploy community Wi-Fi zones in Fremont’s six commercial district plazas. http
RepRoKhanna,Big Oil spends more on stock buybacks and shareholder dividends than low carbon energy. That's why we need to pass my Big Oil Windfall Profits Tax Act with @user
RepRoKhanna,Gun violence is a policy failure. It doesn't have to be this way. @user http
RepRoKhanna,Imagine caring more about keeping books out of schools than assault weapons.
RepRoKhanna,A majority of the deadliest mass shootings in the US happened after the 1994 assault weapons ban expired. I think this speaks for itself. @user http
RepRoKhanna,70% of school shootings in the past two decades have been carried out by minors. There is no reason children should own assault weapons. At minimum we must ban these gun sales to those under 21.
RepRoKhanna,Force a vote on common-sense gun reform that is supported by a majority of Americans so there’s clarity on exactly where Republicans stand. If they’re opposed to universal background checks banning assault weapons from kids &amp; “red flag” laws the American people should know.
RepRoKhanna,The UK is leading the way on a windfall profits tax to hold Big Oil companies accountable for profiteering and sending the money back to consumers. Congress should do the same by passing my Big Oil Windfall Profits Tax with @user https://t.co/6Lfzr4bvtu
RepRoKhanna,In Congress we can’t stand by while the gun lobby blocks action to keep our kids and neighbors safe. A vast majority of Americans support background checks and common-sense gun reform. We need to get rid of the filibuster and pass the gun reform bills sitting in the Senate.
RepRoKhanna,Over the past year we’ve seen far too many instances of gun violence across the country. From Buffalo to Uvalde the epidemic of gun violence is destroying lives and devastating communities.
RepRoKhanna,My prayers and deepest condolences are with the families of the victims and our San Jose community as we mourn those who were killed. They will always remain with us in spirit and in memory.
RepRoKhanna,A tragic day for the VTA family and our community as we remember the nine lives taken by senseless gun violence at the Guadalupe railyard one year ago.
RepRoKhanna,Why are Senate Republicans against a bill on stopping domestic terrorism? Why vote against a bill that would help keep communities safe? http
RepRoKhanna,"I'm not sure how you can call yourself ""pro-life"" if you care more about the gun lobby than protecting the lives of kids in schools."
RepRoKhanna,On the two-year anniversary of the murder of George Floyd we remember his life and continue to push for change. It's shameful that the Senate is still delaying the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. This needs to get done.
