SenWarren,The student loan payment pause has been critical to the financial well-being of millions of Americans especially as families struggle with rising costs of basic necessities.@POTUS should #CancelStudentDebt to relieve millions from this crushing burden once and for all.
SenWarren,My new 26-page investigation shows that Wall Street insiders have used SPACs as their own piggy banks while retail investors have suffered. This industry is rife with fraud self-dealing &amp; inflated fees. I'll be introducing a bill to crack down on abuses.https://t.co/cD9GhBagqv
SenWarren,.@POTUS is right. Two ways Congress can help bring inflation down is by reducing costs for families and fixing our broken tax system that lets giant corporations get away with paying little to nothing in taxes.https://t.co/xSDErBlRPD
SenWarren,I think about the babies teachers &amp; families and how as a country we have failed to keep them safe.But right now Republicans in Congress are blocking any action at all. 90% of America wants to see us act to prevent gun violence. We just need to get it done. http
SenWarren,My three brothers served in the military and made it back to us safely. But that’s not the case for all families. This #MemorialDay we honor servicemembers and their families who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. http
SenWarren,The Supreme Court is poised to overturn #RoeVWade. We're here because Republican politicians have spent decades plotting to force their extremist unpopular agenda on all of America. We must keep fighting and making our voices heard loud and clear — because we can’t go back.
SenWarren,Women owe the majority of federal student loans holding millions back from starting a business or buying a home. This crushing debt burden is also exacerbated by systemic challenges like gender pay inequity and unaffordable child care. #CancelStudentDebthttps://t.co/lRRmozMPf1
SenWarren,Only four companies control nearly 90% of the infant baby formula industry. Years of corporate consolidation have exacerbated the formula shortage today. @POTUS' agenda to promote competition will strengthen supply chains and help lower prices for families.
SenWarren,Ordinary investors thought stablecoins were safe but it turns out they aren’t so stable after all. The TerraUSD crash is a stark reminder that we need rules of the road to protect Americans from losing their life savings in volatile and risky crypto.https://t.co/aEgxveoGhM
SenWarren,Nearly 40% of people with student debt never received a degree. They worked hard did what they were supposed to and tried to advance their education but life happened and now they're getting crushed by debt.Canceling student debt will help working people.
SenWarren,The poultry industry is dominated by a few giant corporations who are cutting pay for farmers and raising prices for consumers. The Biden admin is right to take concrete action to help Americans get lower prices at the grocery store. http
SenWarren,".@Amazon claims to be the ""safest place on earth to work"" but reality doesn't back that up. Workers injuries are alarmingly high &amp; Amazon won't stop putting profits over people. I stand with Daniel Olayiwola &amp; workers fighting for safe workplaces. http"
SenWarren,Democrats have worked for years to enact meaningful gun safety reforms. Republicans refuse to even acknowledge that our weak gun laws are a problem—and abuse the filibuster to block legislation that Americans overwhelmingly support.Saving lives should be a bipartisan effort.
SenWarren,Mitch McConnell already said a national abortion ban is possible if #RoeVWade is overturned. Republicans are prepared to force their extreme position on Americans even in cases of rape &amp; incest. The American people don't support this radical agenda.https://t.co/rcG7h0qNKr
SenWarren,.@SenAmyKlobuchar and I have a new bill to provide $20 billion in election funding for states and localities. Voting is the beating heart of our democracy and this funding is critical for our elections. The Senate should pass this bill.
SenWarren,Let's be clear: Republican Senators are blocking common sense gun safety legislation against the will of the American people. http
SenWarren,One more time in plain English here’s what the experts at the @user have to say: concentrated corporate power amplifies inflation. That’s why we must enforce our antitrust laws and spur competition to lower costs for Americans.
SenWarren,"And here’s what the @user concluded: “the recent rise in concentration is an amplifying factor for the pass-through of current cost shocks emanating from supply shortages energy price shocks and labor market tightness."""
SenWarren,Meaning? Concentration results in market power—&amp; corporations use it to jack up prices &amp; profiteer during inflationary times. @user puts it: “the pass-through of cost shocks into prices..becomes..greater when there's an increase in concentration.”
SenWarren,First they found clear evidence that the economy has become more concentrated: “Industry concentration has increased significantly in the United States in the past 20 years and this trend has accelerated since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
SenWarren,There’s been a lot of debate whether corporate monopolies and price gouging are contributing to inflation when it’s plain as day that’s what’s happening. The @user has weighed in. And here’s what they found. Buckle up. http
