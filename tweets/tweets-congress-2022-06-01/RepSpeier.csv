RepSpeier,Houston: We have a problem. I asked security officials in Latvia &amp; Denmark about gun violence in their countries. In 2018 Denmark had 64 deaths Latvia 25 we had 39740. The 2nd Amendment doesn't cancel the right of everyone to not have to live in fear of being shot &amp; killed!
RepSpeier,On #MemorialDay we honor our dedicated &amp; brave servicemembers who died fighting for our country or were lost to suicide. We are forever indebted to them &amp; their families. I won’t stop fighting until we’ve addressed shamefully high suicide rates w/in our military &amp; among our vets. http
RepSpeier,Maybe this time is different. We really have to be like that old “Network” movie and shout “We are mad as hell and aren’t going to take it anymore!” Let’s be clear though — we have to do MORE than closing the loophole in background checks. http
RepSpeier,There’s painful irony in the fact that some of my colleagues are more concerned about the books in a school library than the safety of the children in the school. 19 children at Robb School in TX will never read another book. I can’t begin to describe how sick this makes me feel.
RepSpeier,The mass shooting that killed teacher Irma Garcia her colleague &amp; 19 children didn’t stop there. Her husband of 24 years Joe has had a fatal heart attack. Their 4 children are now orphans. The death &amp; destruction goes far beyond those shot. We must pass gun safety reforms NOW! http
RepSpeier,We have suffered MORE mass shootings than days in the year so far. 311000+ students have experienced gun violence at school since Columbine. There have been 27 school shootings already this year. Make it STOP. The blood of these children is on the gun lobby &amp; Rs’ hands. http
RepSpeier,As a gunshot survivor I know the pain of bullets shredding your body &amp; the struggle to accept physical &amp; emotional scars. I know the fear of death &amp; the trauma of survivors guilt. No child should ever have to carry this burden. The Senate must pass commonsense gun safety reform!
