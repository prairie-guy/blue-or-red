SenBlumenthal,A bipartisan compromise would help save lives even if it isn’t everything we want or should do on gun violence. Our group will continue to grapple with differences hoping common ground is close. http
SenBlumenthal,We’re at an urgent moment—morally emotionally politically. Americans are demanding: do something. It’s a put up or shut up moment for senators.
SenBlumenthal,Inaction on gun violence is not an option. We need to do everything in our power to prevent mass shootings &amp; gun deaths. The laws we are fighting to pass will save lives.
SenBlumenthal,The Stratford ceremony &amp; parade—always among my Memorial Day favorites—were especially meaningful this year as they returned to rousingly patriotic spirited events. Thanks to all especially the vets who marched or watched for making it memorable. http

SenBlumenthal,This Memorial Day weekend we honor the vets who gave their lives but we also remember &amp; continue to advocate for those who gave their health for our country.

SenBlumenthal,The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms &amp; Explosives has been without a leader since 2015. This has to change.
