RepGuthrie,I also I voted for the Access to Baby Formula Act to give families who participate in WIC the flexibility in this program to buy any type of baby formula that meets FDA’s standards.
RepGuthrie,I supported the Babies Need More Formula Now Act which allows imports of baby formula that meet FDA's standards creates oversight and accountability measures at the FDA removes barriers to allow more baby formula competition &amp; improves coordination between FDA &amp; manufacturers.
RepGuthrie,I provided an update on the baby formula crisis which the Biden Administration worsened by their clumsy response to early warning signs of a shortage. I'm pushing for meaningful action to address the baby formula crisis and prevent future similar crises.
RepGuthrie,Thanks Jessamine County Chamber of Commerce for giving me the opportunity to speak last week and great to see my colleague @user http
RepGuthrie,During Mental Health Awareness Month we recognize more needs to be done to help Americans with their mental health. I’m co-leading a bill that delivers substance use disorder resources &amp; help to those struggling with their mental health. This awaits action on the House Floor.
RepGuthrie,On Memorial Day I’m reminded of the times my grandmother came to pick my brothers and I up to go to the cemetery to honor my uncle who was killed in the Korean War.Please take a moment to reflect on those who have made the ultimate sacrifice so that we can live free. http
