RepTedDeutch,The Everglades is one of South FL’s greatest treasures and more than six million Floridians rely on the wetlands for safe &amp; clean drinking water.This project proposed by @user is essential to restoring the Everglades protecting its ecosystem &amp;  supporting our economy. http
RepTedDeutch,As weather gets more &amp; more extreme this NOAA report is yet another reminder that we must address the ever-growing threat of climate change. https://t.co/bWDYft84km
RepTedDeutch,Americans deserve real solutions to help stop the gun violence epidemic.  And we cannot just move on from The Uvalde tragedy.  Congress must act to save lives. Watch my @user interview here http
RepTedDeutch,We must forever honor their memories by working to ensure that the nation they died defending always remains strong and our people united in that cause. We must never forget those have lost their lives and forever enshrine their memories.(2/2)
RepTedDeutch,Memorial Day is our solemn day to honor those who have died in service of our country. These soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our nation free and we will be forever grateful for their service and sacrifice. (1/2)
RepTedDeutch,I look forward to discussing what we can do about these issues.
RepTedDeutch,DG Grossi’s recent comment that the IAEA is at “very difficult juncture” with Iran underscores the situation’s extreme urgency especially with DG Grossi’s upcoming report on Iran &amp; the IAEA BoG meeting in June. http
RepTedDeutch,The int’l community must also address Iran’s blatant disregard for the IAEA &amp; its investigations which undermines the IAEA's mission and weakens the global nuclear non-proliferation movement.
RepTedDeutch,Of course addressing Iran’s stockpile of 60% enriched uranium and its ongoing enrichment program must and continues to be a top priority for the United States and the international community. We must ensure that Iran is never able to acquire a nuclear weapon.
RepTedDeutch,A new report this week revealed Iran used confidential IAEA reports to prepare cover stories for top Iranian officials and to misdirect &amp; evade IAEA investigations into its nuclear program in the early 2000s.https://t.co/MVCgA4K5dn
RepTedDeutch,This lack of transparency is deeply troubling.https://t.co/ZkivxTdPmA This is part of an ongoing pattern of deception &amp; duplicitous behavior.
RepTedDeutch,DG Grossi recently raised extreme concerns about Iran's continuous delay in providing the necessary information to the IAEA after the org identified traces of uranium at three old yet previously undeclared nuclear sites in Iran.
RepTedDeutch,There have even been reports of Iranian guards physically harassing female IAEA investigators. http
RepTedDeutch,Iran has consistently &amp; clearly undermined the IAEA's work and mission for decades by stonewalling &amp; obstructing the IAEA’s attempts to monitor and investigate Iran’s nuclear program.
RepTedDeutch,Today I’ll meet with the International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi and his team about Iran's concerning nuclear activities. Here are some of the issues and challenges that I plan to discuss while I'm there.
RepTedDeutch,Please read the names and let your heart break over the beauty America lost this week in Uvalde.  http
RepTedDeutch,“When will it end?When we learn to love our children more then we love our guns.”Please read this powerful editorial from the South Florida ⁦@SunSentinel⁩.  http
RepTedDeutch,Why does anyone need to fire 30 rounds at one time?  It’s time to ban high-capacity magazines. http
RepTedDeutch,Weapons of war do not belong in our communities. And an 18 year-old should not be allowed to buy AR’s at all.  If Florida can require you to be 21 to buy any firearm the country should do the same. http
RepTedDeutch,Thank you @user Money and power can never be more important than saving lives. Never. Uvalde and Buffalo are just the latest tragic reminders. Your powerful words matter. Please keep standing up. http
