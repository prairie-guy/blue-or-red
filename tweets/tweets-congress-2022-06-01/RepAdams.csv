RepAdams,On #MemorialDay we remember the brave men and women who gave their lives to defend our country against all enemies. I will continue to honor their sacrifice each and every day and pray for the loved ones left behind. http
RepAdams,As Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month comes to a close I want to highlight the work we’re doing with @user and the @user to make sure every group that’s disproportionately affected by the maternal health crisis can look forward to a better future. http
RepAdams,From Team Adams:Please join us in wishing a very Happy Birthday to Congresswoman Alma S. Adams PhD! http
RepAdams,As we mourn the lives lost in Uvalde we also remember and honor the life of George Floyd whose life was taken too soon two years ago today. Thank you @user  for signing this historical executive order to combat police brutality.
RepAdams,Unfortunately #NC12 is all too familiar with the effects of gun violence. #RileyHowell and #ReedParlier are two of the many lives taken way too soon due to gun violence. #StopGunViolence
RepAdams,May is #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth  and now more than ever more Americans need access to affordable mental health care. We must make changes to keep guns from high-risk people through common-sense #GunViolencePrevention legislation.
RepAdams,The House has already passed legislation to stop this senseless gun violence that would save lives in every community across the United States. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to bring this legislation to the floor. #StopGunViolence
