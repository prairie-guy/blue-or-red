RepDustyJohnson,Today is intern Matthew’s last day in South Dakota’s congressional office. He’s become an essential part of our team — and while we’re sad to see him go we know he’s on to big things! Please thank Matthew for his hard work for South Dakota! http
RepDustyJohnson,South Dakota is home to so many strong manufacturers — Cemcast is one of them. Thanks to the Carlson family for showing me the ropes of the cement business today. The pipes they make will help strengthen our infrastructure across the nation. http
