RepRaskin,I strongly support students speaking up rallying walking out chanting demanding passage of gun safety. Any politician who favors compulsory school attendance along with easy gun laws is setting young people up for disaster. Senate must act!
RepRaskin,My district office staff was thrilled to join the CSPAN team for the StudentCam ceremony at Montgomery Blair High School. Congratulations to all the participants and award winners! http
RepRaskin,The 2nd Amdt allows reasonable gun safety regulation. It does not give anyone the right to carry assault rifles purchase a gun without a violent criminal background check or carry guns into public schools or govt buildings. SCOTUS led by Justice Scalia was emphatic on this.
