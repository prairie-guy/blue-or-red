RepFeenstra,Wrapped up National Beef Month in Cherokee with Senator @user to talk about our Cattle Price Discovery and Transparency Act to bring fairness to the cattle market. Our small independent producers deserve a level playing field to sell their product. #39CountyTour #IA04 http
RepFeenstra,On my third #39CountyTour stop I visited Wells Ag Supply in Fonda. We discussed issues important to the agriculture community in #IA04 especially addressing the rising cost of inputs. In Congress Iâ€™ll continue to deliver results for the small businesses that power our economy. http
RepFeenstra,On my second #39CountyTour stop I toured Ag. Property Solutions - a general contractor for swine dairy and poultry producers - in Emmetsburg. We discussed the importance of helping our #IA04 farmers navigate red tape and producing the worldâ€™s most abundant food supply. http
RepFeenstra,Started my morning touring Morton Buildings in Spencer on my #39CountyTour. They specialize in farm sheds and agricultural construction. Iâ€™ll continue to advocate for the #IA04 businesses that support our farmers and their families as they feed our country and the world. http
RepFeenstra,The formula crisis is impacting families in #IA04 &amp; nationwide including my friend Rep. Megan Jones. Sheâ€™s a mom of 4 with a 5th on the way. Check out her op-ed in @user on how Republicans in DSM &amp; D.C. are working to get formula back on the shelves. https://t.co/BRRAJhhGNs
