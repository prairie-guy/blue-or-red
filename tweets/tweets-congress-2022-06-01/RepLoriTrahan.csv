The fight for true equality under the law continues.
RepLoriTrahan,Michael &amp; his family have been running @user in Marlborough for over 40 years. He received #RestaurantRevitalizationFund relief to keep his doors open and keep serving folks across the community. I proudly supported this program &amp; believe we need to replenish the fund. http
