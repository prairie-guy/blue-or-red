RepDonaldPayne,June is National Gun Violence Awareness Month.  We MUST do more to get guns out of the hands of criminals. Today I became a co-sponsor of the new Protecting Our Kids Act (H.R. 7910) to raise the gun purchase age to 21 ban large capacity magazine for non-police use. http
RepDonaldPayne,June is Pride Month!  It is a great time to show our support for the country's LGBTQ+ community!  I have always been a strong supporter of diversity and inclusion in Congress and in my communities.  For a Pride event in your area contact a local advocacy group or city hall. http
RepDonaldPayne,As we enter Pride Month in June I enjoyed being at RWJ University Hospital Rahwayâ€™s Pride Flag raising and celebration today.  The hospital was recognized as a Leader in LGBTQ+ Healthcare by the Human Rights Campaign- the highest designation a hospital can receive from it. http
RepDonaldPayne,Today I had a great meeting with Chris Smalls- the man behind the historic move to unionize the Amazon warehouse in Staten Island New York.  I congratulated him and spoke about what's next.  Then we spoke about living in Newark and how I could help him in the future. http
RepDonaldPayne,I hope everyone has a safe and enjoyable Memorial Day.Please find time today to pause for a prayer or moment of silence to honor the American soldiers and personnel who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedoms. http
RepDonaldPayne,This week marked the 2nd anniversary of George Floyd's tragic death.  Pres. Biden's executive order is a good step.  But the Senate must pass the George Floyd Justice In Policing Act to ban chokeholds and other violent police actions permanently.      https://t.co/KxgaSzKDB2 http
