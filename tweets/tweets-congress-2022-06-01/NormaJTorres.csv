NormaJTorres,.@CityofMontclair and the @user Army Junior ROTC led a Memorial Day Ceremony honoring six veterans who passed away and are now memorialized on the Veteran‚Äôs Memorial Wall. May they and all those who sacrificed their lives in service to our country Rest In Peace. http
NormaJTorres,This is not normal. We will not allow this to become normal. It‚Äôs time for action. http
NormaJTorres,This #MemorialDay I'm thinking of Army Specialist Enrique Roman-Martinez who disappeared and died two years ago this weekend. We will always honor and remember Enrique and continue to seek justice for his family. http
NormaJTorres,Today I joined @user @user and @user for their Memorial Day ceremonies honoring our fallen servicemen and women. Thank you to all who joined us to commemorate those who made the greatest sacrifice for our country. http
NormaJTorres,.Stop deflecting on the fact that two AR-15‚Äôs were sold to a mentally unstable 18 year old. Who allowed this to happen? The Texas legislature &amp; their dumb-ass governor! Not to mention 50 GOP US Senators &amp; 2 Democrats #AbbottFailedTexasAgain #AbbottCruzMassacre #EndTheFilibuster http
NormaJTorres,No words! üò≠ http
NormaJTorres,.What happens to your ‚Äúhuman rights when you are dead and buried?‚Äù This is such a stupid tone death attempt to pivot. üëáüèº we cannot forgive the fact that 19 children and their teachers were murdered while in school with a weapon of war. http
NormaJTorres,@user This legislation is a step toward protecting our communities from senseless attacks on children in schools and people in church or out shopping. Gun violence is the leading cause of death among children ‚Äì it's time for change. We owe it to every family in America.
NormaJTorres,On Tuesday we lost 21 lives to horrific violence. Rather than sending thoughts &amp; prayers I‚Äôm listening to the majority of Americans who are tired of waiting for change. Today I am reintroducing the Multiple Firearm Sales Reporting Modernization Act. http http
NormaJTorres,Days after 21 people were slaughtered in an elementary school Republicans are still attending the NRA conference in Texas. And get this guns are banned in the conference. They are okay with AR-15s at schools but not at their events.
NormaJTorres,Republicans are too cowardly to even DEBATE protecting Americans from gun violence and domestic terrorism. Despicable. http
NormaJTorres,History repeating itself over &amp; over again. Call your U.S. Senators (202) 224-3121 &amp; demand action. #EndTheFilibuster #SensibleGunLaws #50 Republican &amp; #2Democrats are blocking the vote. http
NormaJTorres,.@SenateDems üëáüèª http
NormaJTorres,Children are affected by violence in schools even if they don‚Äôt directly experience it. Here are some resources to help parents and educators communicate with children about violence. http
NormaJTorres,Since 2020 gun violence is the leading cause of death among children and teenagers. When car crashes were the leading cause of death to children we changed the laws. We made cars and driving safer. Now it‚Äôs time to act on #gunviolenceprevention.
NormaJTorres,Call (202) 224-3121 to be connected to your Senator to express your concerns and urge them to pass the Bipartisan Background Checks Act and the Enhanced Background Checks Act.
NormaJTorres,There are no words to describe what these families are going through right now. What are we doing if we cannot even protect our children. The Senate must take action before more of our children are taken away by guns designed for war.
NormaJTorres,Llame a (202) 224-3121 para conectarse con su Senador para expresar sus inquietudes e instarlos a aprobar la Ley de Verificaci√≥n de Antecedentes Bipartidista y la Ley de Verificaci√≥n de Antecedentes Mejorada.
NormaJTorres,No hay palabras para describir lo que estas familias est√°n pasando en este momento. Qu√© estamos haciendo si ni siquiera podemos proteger a nuestros hijos? El Senado debe tomar medidas antes de que m√°s de nuestros ni√±os sean arrebatados con armas dise√±adas para la guerra. http
