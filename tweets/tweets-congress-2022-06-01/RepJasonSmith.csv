RepJasonSmith,At the border today hearing about the challenges of patrolling such a large land area when there is a massive increase in the # of illegal immigrants. Our brave Border Patrol agents are also having to plan for things to get worse if the Title 42 border policy goes away.
RepJasonSmith,President Biden’s border policies allowed 2.4 million encounters with illegal immigrants to happen at the southern border. With the highest number of illegal immigrants coming over in 20 years Biden’s budget cuts Homeland Security funding – including a $150M cut to ICE. http
RepJasonSmith,"Border Patrol briefed us on the state of the border.@SecMayorkas couldn't be more wrong: The Biden Administration hasn't ""effectively managed"" the border.Cartels have made $96 billion off the chaos and lawlessness at the southern border. http"
RepJasonSmith,Just toured a processing facility where illegal immigrants come first after crossing the southern border.It's clear that Biden’s Border Crisis has put Border Patrol in an untenable situation trying to keep up with a surge of illegal immigrants. http
RepJasonSmith,Hearing directly from Border Patrol about the crisis at our Southern Border. Every 7 days they experience 10k encounters in the RGV sector. http
RepJasonSmith,I'm proud to be joined by my Republican colleagues: @user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user
RepJasonSmith,Here in McAllen TX to see President Biden's border crisis firsthand and speak with the brave Border Patrol agents guarding our southern border.
RepJasonSmith,Families are saving less as inflation takes a bigger bite of each paycheck. Inflation is robbing Americans of a secure retirement tomorrow to pay the price of Washington Democrats' reckless spending today.
RepJasonSmith,The stories from Uvalde are heartbreaking. We pray for the families who have suffered such a grievous loss and hope they find comfort in the outpouring of love and support from Americans from all walks of life.
RepJasonSmith,Democrats rejected efforts to include fraud prevention when they rushed to enact their American Rescue Plan. What did the American people get? Help wanted signs the highest prices in 40yrs &amp; rampant misuse &amp; abuse of federal tax dollars. Read the full letter here: http
RepJasonSmith,"With rampant reports of COVID spending fraud &amp; misuse @user @user and @user and I sent a letter to AG Garland demanding answers on Biden Admin’s too little too late fraud response &amp; his so-called ""Pandemic Prosecutor.""https://t.co/cpnEHa0KIX"
RepJasonSmith,On Memorial Day we honor the heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice for America and its ideals of freedom and liberty. http
RepJasonSmith,Biden and Washington Democrats like to pass the blame for inflation to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Before a single Russian troop set foot in Ukraine inflation had ARLEADY increased 7.5% since Biden took office.
RepJasonSmith,http
RepJasonSmith,Biden clearly doesn’t care about securing our southern border. He wants to take away Title 42 – one of the few tools to manage the surge of migrants crossing the border.
RepJasonSmith,Today – #JerusalemDay – marks 55 years since the liberation and reunification of Jerusalem under Jewish sovereignty.We pray for peace for our friends in Jerusalem and join in wishing Happy Yom Yerushalayim! http
RepJasonSmith,Missouri parents are some of the hardest hit by Biden’s baby formula shortage. Unacceptable that Biden’s FDA did so little to prevent the bare shelves families are facing.
RepJasonSmith,Americans traveling for Memorial Day weekend will pay more than ever for gas. This administration keeps making it worse and worse for the working class.
RepJasonSmith,One of my highlights each year is seeing the creativity of high school artists in our annual Congressional Art Competition. Congratulations to all who submitted a work including this year’s winner Macey Penner from Mountain Grove High School for her painting “Blue Boy.” http
RepJasonSmith,Access to health care is one of the biggest issues we face in rural Missouri.It was awesome to see Ozarks Healthcare’s facility expansion in West Plains. I was proud to support their efforts to obtain the USDA Community Facility direct loan that made this possible. http
RepJasonSmith,I had a great discussion with the folks at Harps grocery store in Thayer.We talked about how the inflation supply chain and labor crises are hitting families.I saw the baby formula shortage firsthand. It's completely unacceptable to me that families have to ration formula. http
RepJasonSmith,"The National Endowment for the Humanities is spending American Rescue Plan $ on ""Indigenous canoe-building"" &amp; an exhibit on Ancient Egypt.Unlike hieroglyphics it's clear what's going on here. When you spend a boatload of cash you get canoe-building.https://t.co/pW3Dj7QZM9 http"
RepJasonSmith,After being dishonest about his deficit-spending driven inflation – denying it existed and then dismissing it as “temporary” – @user Biden now claims he's all about cutting the deficit? Really?That's hogwash. http
RepJasonSmith,It’s fairly easy to debunk Biden’s false talking point that inflation is Vladimir Putin’s fault. After all inflation rose 7.5% even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. http
RepJasonSmith,Watch as @user Dir. Swagel explains the very real fiscal risk of high inflation – sparking higher interest rates that alongside rising debt lead to higher interest payments to service that debt. http
RepJasonSmith,If CBO believes inflation will be at ONE percent for the rest of this year to meet their economic forecast I have some oceanfront property in Arizona I would like to sell them. http
RepJasonSmith,The silver lining in the CBO baseline – federal revenues are way up thanks to the Republican-passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Tax burdens on families and job creators are down while tax revenue is on pace to be highest share of GDP ever. http
RepJasonSmith,Biden’s legacy is higher prices more debt the highest gas prices ever recorded and a supply chain crisis. http
RepJasonSmith,The $2 trillion “American Rescue Plan” didn’t create any of the 4 million jobs Biden promised. What it did create was the highest inflation in 40 years by spending tax dollars on wasteful projects. http
RepJasonSmith,CBO's baseline confirms America’s fiscal health is getting worse under one-party Democrat rule. http
RepJasonSmith,It was great to visit with Buffington Brothers Heating and Cooling in Poplar Bluff. Family-owned businesses are struggling from our country's inflation labor and supply chain crises. I'm working in Washington to get government out of the way of Missouri businesses. http
RepJasonSmith,CBO's latest baseline shows America's fiscal &amp; economic health is getting worse under President Biden. Washington Democrats should view this report as a wake-up call to abandon their high tax and deficit spending agenda.My full statement: http http
RepJasonSmith,The White House keeps focusing on year-over-year inflation because that’s the GOOD news for his administration. The reality? Inflation has increased 11 percent in the 16 months since Joe Biden became President.
