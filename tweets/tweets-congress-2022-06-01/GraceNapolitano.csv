GraceNapolitano,Today we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our country free. Grateful to the Cities of El Monte West Covina &amp; La Verne for holding these solemn observances so we could pay tribute to our fallen heroes. Wishing all a safe healthy and reflective Memorial Day http
GraceNapolitano,YES! üëè Thank you Mr. President Madam First Lady Surgeon General Murthy &amp; Selena Gomez for speaking out for mental health especially in our schools! Together we can strengthen the mental well-being of all our communities &amp; eventually live in a world where there is NO STIGMA! http
GraceNapolitano,This is why I was proud to have included $3 billion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to continue to implement grade separation projects in our region and across the country. #BuildBackBetter
GraceNapolitano,This will dramatically improve safety shorten commute times and reduce pollution by allowing motorists bicyclists and pedestrians to not have to wait for the train.
GraceNapolitano,Grade separation projects- like this now completed Durfee Ave one in the City of Pico Rivera- that separate the road from the rail line are so important to our communities in the San Gabriel Valley. http
GraceNapolitano,We are not hopeless. We have bills the vast majority of Americans support ready to move to stop this senseless gun violence and save lives in our communities. I join my constituents and colleagues who demand action to end gun violence now.
GraceNapolitano,It‚Äôs outrageous that gun violence is now the leading cause of death among children. We cannot allow these preventable tragedies to continue. We must stand up to the NRA and stand up for America‚Äôs children our future.
