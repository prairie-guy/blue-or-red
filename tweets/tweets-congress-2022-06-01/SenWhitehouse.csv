SenWhitehouse,The one through-line for Mitch is the political money.   It’s always about the political money and the NRA is the conduit for masses of political money — $100 million in dark money alone.https://t.co/CwJFgB67gI
SenWhitehouse,But the fossil fuel propaganda machine charged forward anyway.
SenWhitehouse,“In late March AFP Fact Check a global fact-checking organization debunked the assertion that climate policies from the Biden administration somehow restrained oil and gas output or undermined American energy security calling it ‘misleading.’”https://t.co/UAaTSmwiBH
SenWhitehouse,“Morale rises once you realize your own strength.”https://t.co/bz6umPHcEC
SenWhitehouse,While we know ~$2.5B will come to RI through the bipartisan infrastructure law a lot more funding is available through competitive grant programs like the INFRA Program I created. Grateful to Partnership for RI for organizing to make RI even more competitive as we apply. http
SenWhitehouse,If the decision to block the in-state merger leads to an out-of-state acquisition it will have been a tragedy and likely start a cascade of lost local control of Rhode Island hospitals. https://t.co/mUY2tRKetO
SenWhitehouse,Thus comes to its ignominious end this walking-zombie part of Trump’s political effort to use the DOJ to make war on Hillary Clinton. https://t.co/fetO4aRweO
SenWhitehouse,Double-speak from fossil fuel industry — what a surprise.https://t.co/eE94ysWi9A
SenWhitehouse,We used to have an assault weapons ban in this country. The ban expired in 2004 and Congress – at the direction of the NRA – refused to reinstate it.Since then mass shootings have become regular fixtures of American life.
SenWhitehouse,To those who knew Walter he was an unforgettable Rhode Island character. I am sorry to learn of his death.  https://t.co/L9TSd8nRlN
SenWhitehouse,Big Oil’s effort to “remove” Rhode Island’s climate fraud lawsuit to federal court fails in First Circuit. They even tried to pretend this was an admiralty case involving shipping. Anything rather than face the consequences of their misconduct.https://t.co/ckQC0tveCD
SenWhitehouse,Here’s the longer version: the carbon footprint of cash sitting in banks that aid and abet fossil fuel pollution is a big contributor.  https://t.co/ixXnTlG45Y
SenWhitehouse,Beautiful day for the Lincoln Memorial Day parade. http
SenWhitehouse,http
SenWhitehouse,Rhode Island National Guard deployment send-off on Memorial Day at Quonset. http
SenWhitehouse,Hmmm. I wonder what the common theme here could be?
SenWhitehouse,Voter suppression and gerrymandering use enormous amounts of hidden political money to limit who goes to the polls defeat majority rule and thus control legislative action.
SenWhitehouse,The Supreme Court has been packed like some crooked railroad commission using enormous amounts of hidden political money to rule over us by going around legislative action.
SenWhitehouse,The fossil fuel industry rules Republicans using enormous amounts of hidden political money to blockade any serious legislative action on climate change.
SenWhitehouse,The NRA dominates Republicans using enormous amounts of hidden political money to enforce a blockade of legislative action.
SenWhitehouse,I can assure you he’s not the only one. Other judges are appalled at what they see on the Supreme Court. Let the deluge begin.https://t.co/WMbukHQgrn
SenWhitehouse,The Supreme Court’s Republican justices are determined to remake America - that shouldn’t surprise anybody given the amount of dark money that far-right donors spent to put them there.
SenWhitehouse,This should tell you all you need to know. https://t.co/TuwJRFvy3x
SenWhitehouse,The massacre of children &amp; teachers in Uvalde was a preventable tragedy but laws to prevent such horrors are blocked by the gun manufacturers’ ruthless lobbying campaigns. Gun safety legislation is the only way forward and breaking the grip of the NRA is the key.
SenWhitehouse,http
SenWhitehouse,This is apparently not a hoax but actually from the company that made the weapon that massacred the children in Uvalde. http
SenWhitehouse,There is a lot Congress can do to prevent mass shootings: assault weapon bans better background checks high-capacity magazine bans. But Senate Republicans won’t act because of NRA money. The gun problem won’t be fixed until we fix what’s broken in our politics.
SenWhitehouse,Our hearts are broken for the families of the little children and teachers who were massacred in their classroom in a Texas elementary school this week. This is not normal – Americans do not need to accept mass carnage in schools and grocery stores. http
SenWhitehouse,“Capitalism’s suicide machine” — banks still funding Big Oil.https://t.co/OvghbSJ0Cp
SenWhitehouse,We need to fight for an America where you don’t have to have active shooter drills in schools. @user @user @user http
SenWhitehouse,Congress won’t listen to them because the scientists just you know know what they’re talking about and tell truth but don’t have SuperPACs and dark money front groups and lobbyists like the fossil fuel liars have. https://t.co/uSZXr7TLTH
SenWhitehouse,If we could expose dark money in our politics we could see how deep right-wing billionaire influence has become — including capturing the Supreme Court as its tool. My DISCLOSE Act would do that.https://t.co/0ooAktS1zU
SenWhitehouse,Today Senate Republicans blocked a domestic terror bill that would have given us a chance to address gun violence in our schools. The NRA barks an order they comply.
SenWhitehouse,And here’s the confession of a former gun industry executive confirming the malign influence exercised by the gun industry through an absolutist NRA.  https://t.co/y8K0RPEdnb
SenWhitehouse,…funded by gun manufacturers building an empire of dark money influence as a political firewall against responsible action.
SenWhitehouse,In the wake of horrific massacres our rage &amp; grief are justified. But as time goes by &amp; emotions pass the NRA plows on relentlessly…https://t.co/wfm3A85iZn
SenWhitehouse,There’s a simple reason why we haven’t made progress on preventing mass shootings. http
SenWhitehouse,The NRA wants to talk about “reasonable” responses to massacres and murders but there’s nothing about the NRA’s position that is “reasonable.” It has an absolutist ideology about guns that is driven by economic motivation – to keep gun manufactures making profits.
SenWhitehouse,In a few minutes I’ll join @user to discuss gun safety legislation and the gun industry playbook for blocking action.
SenWhitehouse,Remember: the NRA has a cynical playbook for moments like this. Don’t fall for it.
SenWhitehouse,It is intensely frustrating to the point of sickening to serve in this body while massacres of children and others take place in venues like grocery stores and elementary schools and we do nothing.
