SenSchumer,Today the Senate is voting on the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act to help combat a serious cause of gun violence:Domestic terrorism and white supremacyIt will give the government the tools to monitor find &amp; arrest evil actors before they have a chance to inflict violence
SenSchumer,GOP Sen. Johnson just tried for a bill that could see more guns in schools—I blocked it.The truth: There were officers at the school in Texas. The shooter got past them.We need real solutions—We will vote on gun legislation starting with the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act.
