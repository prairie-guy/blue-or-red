GerryConnolly,Weâ€™re having issues with the phones in our DC office today â€” if you need assistance please call us in Annandale at (703) 256-3071.
GerryConnolly,Soon the House will vote on several gun control measures that the vast majority of Americans support.We will pass themâ€”again.The Senate must do the same. Our childrenâ€™s lives depend on it.
GerryConnolly,Today we honor the bravest among us who gave their lives in service to their country. Happy #MemorialDay everyone.
GerryConnolly,ðŸš¨The @user donated $10000 to VA Republicans *on the day of the massacre in Uvalde* according to @user will bankroll their campaigns with blood money.https://t.co/4KEFAHwHyG http
GerryConnolly,The AR-15 is designed to kill quickly and brutally. If youâ€™re picturing a small round bullet hole like you might see in a movie you are wrong.In Uvalde parents had to provide DNA to identify the otherwise unrecognizable bodies of their own children.
GerryConnolly,There is efficacy in action. There is continued madness in inaction. http
GerryConnolly,Students across the country are staging school walkouts to demand action on guns. They give me hope but it is unconscionable that this responsibility has been shifted on to them.No child should have to protest for the right to survive the school day.
GerryConnolly,The @user is headquartered in my district but I will never be their Representative.Iâ€™m at their front door tonight to remind them. http
GerryConnolly,Too young to buy cigarettes or a beer but old enough to buy two assault rifles and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.Thereâ€™s just no way to justify that.
GerryConnolly,Gun violence is now the NUMBER ONE cause of death among American kids.Not cancer. Not car crashes.Guns.
