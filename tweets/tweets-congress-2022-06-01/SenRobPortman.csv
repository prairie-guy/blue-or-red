SenRobPortman,According to President Biden “The price at the pump is elevated in large part because Russian oil gas and refining capacity are off the market.” But we know fuel prices increased by 48% before Russia’s invasion into #Ukraine.
SenRobPortman,Today gas is $4.62. The highest recorded average in American history.
SenRobPortman,Instead of offering real solutions President Biden announced that he would “let the @user do their job” in his most recent @user Op ed. This is not a solution. Nor is blaming Russia for prices at the pump.
SenRobPortman,This is due to the Biden admin’s excessive spending that even Democrat economist Larry Summers warned would overheat the economy along with misguided energy policies that have contributed to historically high energy prices.
SenRobPortman,Inflation is at its highest level in nearly 40 years. The price of everything from gas prices to groceries to housing has skyrocketed and working families are feeling the effects.
SenRobPortman,Although this is a positive step Europe must continue on its path to fully ban all Russian energy. As I have been saying on the Senate floor the U.S. should continue to strengthen our partnership with the EU through this transition to energy independence from Russia. http
SenRobPortman,It was clear during my meetings in Europe including with a senior Ukrainian liaison at @user and other allied countries that #Ukraine needs this weapons system now to defend against the continued Russian assault on their country.
SenRobPortman,The MLRS is defensive conventional weaponry that would help balance the battlefield in eastern #Ukraine where the most fierce fighting is occurring and where Russians are making incremental gains.
SenRobPortman,I urge the admin to immediately provide #Ukraine with the multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) Ukraine has requested. This more effective artillery is needed to help #Ukraine defend the eastern portion of its country against Russia's attacks.
SenRobPortman,On this Memorial Day we remember the brave men and women who have laid down their lives to defend our country. Join me in honoring the sacrifices of those who paid the ultimate price for our freedom.
SenRobPortman,The admin must not deter itself from providing this assistance for fear of provoking Russia. The MLRS can help balance the field in Ukraine's favor and should be approved and shipped immediately.
SenRobPortman,The admin must immediately provide Ukraine with the multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) Ukraine has requested. This defensive weaponry will help Ukraine defend the eastern portion of its country against Russia's advances.
SenRobPortman,I also met with Moldova’s Minister of Internal Affairs Ana Revenco. We discussed the significant challenges that Moldova has faced on its border with Ukraine and how extremely generous the Moldovan people have been welcoming Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion. http
SenRobPortman,I also had the opportunity to meet with Natalia Gavrilita Moldova’s Prime Minister to discuss the security and humanitarian situation in eastern Europe and thank them for their assistance in this effort. http
SenRobPortman,Today while at the joint Ukraine-Moldova border crossing at Palanca I proudly walked into Ukraine. I also had the opportunity to speak with several Ukrainians crossing the border and hear about their concerns about what Russia was doing to their country. http
SenRobPortman,Specifically we should provide the MLRS mobile rocket launchers the Ukrainians are requesting. These are defensive weapons needed to protect Ukraine. Our allies and the US must continue to give #Ukraine the tools it needs to defend itself from the brutal Russian attacks.
SenRobPortman,Based on my briefings and discussions this weekend in Germany and Eastern Europe including with senior Ukrainian officials I believe the administration should immediately provide artillery to Ukraine that can more effectively counter the Russian weapons.
SenRobPortman,My statement on @user federal charges against #Ohio-based alleged ISIS operative using our unsecure southern border to smuggle in terrorists: http http
SenRobPortman,Romania is a steadfast ally of the US and I was able to convey how much the us appreciates their support. http
SenRobPortman,Pleased to meet with Prime Minister Ciuca Economy Minister Sparatu State Secretary Fota members of parliament and representatives of the Ukraine refugee response in Romania on Saturday. We had the opp to discus the security and humanitarian situation in Eastern Europe.
SenRobPortman,U.S. military leadership in Europe is working with over 40 allied countries to provide military assistance to enable Ukraine to defend itself. I had very helpful briefings from our military this weekend and appreciated the chance to thank US troops stationed there.
SenRobPortman,After my briefings today it is clear that although the Ukrainians are fighting bravely in the east they are outgunned by the Russians. These MLRS systems can help balance the field in Ukraine’s favor. http
SenRobPortman,I urge the administration to immediately provide Ukraine with the multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) that Ukraine has requested. This has been one of President Zelenskyy’s top requests from the West for some time and we must provide it urgently.
SenRobPortman,I also met with U.S. troops stationed at USAG Stuttgart including many from #Ohio and thanked them for their commitment to the U.S. and its support for freedom loving countries. http http
SenRobPortman,Today I traveled to Stuttgart Germany where I met with leadership of the United States European Command. I received several security briefings regarding the war in Ukraine and the security and refugee situation in eastern Europe.
SenRobPortman,I am proud of the work my friend @user and his brainchild @user are doing to address the food shortage crisis #Ukraine and across the world. http
SenRobPortman,These tariffs were imposed after the U.S. found China stealing billions of dollars of intellectual property. We must make clear to China that failing to comply with the Phase One Trade Agreement has consequences. http
SenRobPortman,The Biden admin has publicly signaled a desire to lift the tariffs a policy position long advocated for by the Chinese Communist Party.
SenRobPortman,Yesterday I urged President Biden in a bipartisan letter to keep Section 301 tariffs in place which currently target China and its illegal and unfair trade practices that undermine American #jobs.
SenRobPortman,Over the next 5 years the UTC program will fund 35 university consortiums that will explore mobility safety and advanced transportation research in order to address critical transportation challenges throughout the U.S.
SenRobPortman,I am pleased that @user has announced $450 million for the University Transportation Centers Program made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law I helped spearhead.
SenRobPortman,The Biden admin claims that it has lowered budget deficits. The reality is while the deficit will shrink next year it will grow exponentially through 2032 when it will be 6.1% of GDP a figure only seen six times since WW2.
SenRobPortman,Today’s @user report shows inflation will continue to remain high through 2024. Instead of pursuing more of the same reckless spending the Biden admin should work with Republicans on common-sense policies that encourage growth w/o inflation.
SenRobPortman,We must do everything possible to stop foreign governments from stealing our research and innovation. http
SenRobPortman,US innovation continues to be a high-value target for China’s talent recruitment efforts &amp; any conference report w/ significant increased levels of federal funding w/out the protections included in the Safeguarding American Innovation Act would be a huge giveaway to Beijing.
SenRobPortman,I commend @user for its work to help protect American innovation &amp; research from theft by foreign govts like #China. This case highlights the need to ensure my Senate-passed bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act is included in the USICA conference report.
