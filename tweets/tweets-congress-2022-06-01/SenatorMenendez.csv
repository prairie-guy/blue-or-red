SenatorMenendez,Great to be back at @user Center for Discovery and Innovation today to announce a $65 million grant from the NIH to continue the kind of life-saving work that has guided us through this pandemic and to help develop treatments for future viral threats. http
SenatorMenendez,We don‚Äôt have time for Republicans to slow-walk efforts to prevent the next mass shooting. 9 people lost their lives to gun violence this Memorial Day weekend and until we act more lives will be lost. The time for action is NOW. http
SenatorMenendez,May God bless America and may God bless those who have lost their lives for this nation for us and for our way of life. http
SenatorMenendez,Took a moment to write down some more of my reflections on this past week‚Äôs horrific event in Uvalde TX. Read my full thoughts here: https://t.co/PhWI0EOoWV
SenatorMenendez,"Republicans: ""Gun reform will never work the criminals will always find a way."" Also Republicans: If only the door had been locked the shooter would have just turned around and gone home and none of this would have happened. How are we supposed to take them seriously?"
SenatorMenendez,It's no surprise that this is their plan ‚Äì the amount of gun sales this would require would be great news for the gun lobby. It‚Äôll also traumatize every kid whose school will be turned into a war zone.For a party that's supposed to be all about freedom that's no way to govern.
SenatorMenendez,That's a force of 260000 armed officers ‚Äî more than the number of U.S. troops currently serving overseas. This is Republicans' solution. They'd rather deploy a full-blown army ‚Äî against ourselves ‚Äî than pass even simple common sense gun reforms.
SenatorMenendez,Between public &amp; private elementary and high schools that's about 130000 schools in the U.S. that would need to be defended. Let's say conservatively we need at least 2 guards for each school in case one calls in sick.
SenatorMenendez,üßµ THREAD: Seeing a lot of Republicans saying we need more armed guards in schools. Let's take a second to look at what that proposal would look like‚¨áÔ∏è
SenatorMenendez,A few weeks ago this project got started thanks to federal funding I helped to deliver through my Save Our Seas 2.0 Act. Proud to see it completed so quickly and excited for what‚Äôs next in Hoboken‚Äôs waterfront revitalization. http
SenatorMenendez,Today‚Äôs vote is a clear indication that Republicans continue to take their cues from President Trump and others who tolerate enflame and benefit from extremist rhetoric with no regard for the human cost of their support for white supremacists. http

SenatorMenendez,I'm glad @user has said the Senate WILL VOTE on gun legislation and show the American people where we stand. I will keep working to have as many of these provisions as possible brought for a vote on the floor:
SenatorMenendez,THREAD: After a day of shining a light on some of my colleagues who refuse to back up their ‚Äúthoughts and prayers‚Äù with action I‚Äôd be remiss if I didn‚Äôt also share some of the steps I‚Äôm taking and bills I‚Äôve introduced to confront this crisis ‚¨áÔ∏è
SenatorMenendez,La p√©rdida de vidas en un ataque vil y sin sentido como el de Uvalde TX es doloroso y frustrante. Es hora de actuar para honrar las vidas de estos 19 √°ngeles con reformas de sentido com√∫n que prevengan futuros tiroteos masivos.https://t.co/gctzGrmCqy
SenatorMenendez,This must be just the beginning. While holding federal agencies accountable for the example they set for law enforcement throughout the country is a positive first step Congress must do more including passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
SenatorMenendez,I applaud @user for taking action today for George Floyd Breonna Taylor and so many others by cracking down on no-knock warrants and unjustified use-of-force in federal law enforcement. http
SenatorMenendez,Proud to see Under Secretary Xochitl Torres Small discussing USDA‚Äôs critical rural housing work at the Banking &amp; Housing Committee today. As a Latina leader she knows what‚Äôs needed to address the challenges facing rural minority communities.
SenatorMenendez,I know that commitment will shine when she assumes her place on the federal bench and I‚Äôm proud to have recommended Ms. Evelyn Padin for this nomination and voted today in support of her confirmation.
SenatorMenendez,BREAKING: The Senate just confirmed a 6th U.S. District Court Judge for the District of NJ.  Beyond her impeccable credentials and her lived experience as a barrier-breaking Latina in NJ and the legal profession Ms. Padin has a relentless commitment to equal justice under law. http
SenatorMenendez,There must be some common ground for us to come together and stop this senseless violence.
SenatorMenendez,The photos we‚Äôre starting to see the stories we‚Äôre beginning to hear about the victims of yesterday‚Äôs shooting leave me with a pit in my stomach. They‚Äôre young children most of them Latino and not much older than my own grandchildren.What are we waiting for? http
