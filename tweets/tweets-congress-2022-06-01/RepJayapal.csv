RepJayapal,A broken system is when people have to decide between putting food on the table or getting life-saving prescription drugs. Everyone deserves access to quality affordable healthcare. We need Medicare for All now.
RepJayapal,It's only been a week since the horrific shooting in Uvalde. Parents are still burying their children. And yet we've seen more than a dozen shootings since. We can't keep living like this. Enough of putting guns over people's lives. http

RepJayapal,It's been one week since 19 children and two teachers were murdered in Uvalde Texas. Lives cut unfairly short and another community forever changed because of the epidemic of gun violence in our country. When we say never again we have to mean it. It's time to act.
RepJayapal,Today we honor all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Thank you to all those who choose to serve our nation.
RepJayapal,I am a proud sponsor of HR 1808 the Assault Weapons Ban of 2021.Legislation like this cannot wait. There is no reason why the average person should be able to walk into a store and buy an AR-15. Period.
RepJayapal,Children shouldn't have to ask Congress to act.It's time for the Senate GOP to step up and protect these kids.https://t.co/efo1NQpazh

RepJayapal,Thank you @user for taking steps that Senate Republicans continue to block.There is still so much work to be done but these actions are an important step forward.https://t.co/00EUA25vSH
RepJayapal,40% of Uvalde's budget goes to police. The school district even has its own police force.But it took police an hour to enter the classroom where children were being killed. The only answer here to save lives is gun reform.
RepJayapal,Maybe if the GOP spent half as much time as they do finding ways to strip away our reproductive rights on gun safety reform and improving access to mental health care lives would actually be saved.https://t.co/H4BINK6E1V
RepJayapal,There is no reason for weapons of war to be on our streets in our grocery stores our schools our places of worship.Our communities would be safer with an assault weapons ban.

RepJayapal,There have been 213 mass shootings in 2022. That is more than one mass shooting per day. The solution is clear: it's time for gun reform. How many more must die before the GOP works with us to protect our kids?
RepJayapal,Just a reminder @user is tackling this issue head-on while House Republicans tried to block funding to end this crisis.https://t.co/wQT167QDn6
RepJayapal,Two years ago George Floyd was murdered. Today my heart is with his family and community.And today the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is being blocked in the Senate by the filibuster. It is time to honor his memory by acting on this critical legislation.
