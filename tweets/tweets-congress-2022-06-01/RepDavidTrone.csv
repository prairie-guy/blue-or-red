RepDavidTrone,June is #PrideMonth a time when we uplift and celebrate those in the LGBTQ+ community. It also serves as a time for us to recognize the struggles and hardships these folks have endured throughout history‚Äî and still to this day. In Congress I will always fight for LGBTQ+ rights. http
RepDavidTrone,His family finally received the closure America‚Äôs Gold Star families earn. On #MemorialDay we stand to honor those who like ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù made the ultimate sacrifice. We must never forget: ‚ÄúThis nation will remain the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the brave.‚Äù üá∫üá∏ http
RepDavidTrone,As the proud son of a World War II combat veteran I can‚Äôt imagine what his family went through. But credit to the tireless efforts of his loved ones Sgt. DeLauter‚Äôs remains were finally brought home last month to Hagerstown and given a proper burial with full military honors.
RepDavidTrone,On December 1 1950 Sgt. DeLauter was tragically killed in action while serving our country in the Korean War. Like many fallen service members of foreign wars his remains could not be easily recovered and was considered ‚ÄúMissing in Action‚Äù for over 70 years.
RepDavidTrone,In Congress I have the honor of serving on @user to ensure our service members and their families are cared for. Here at home I recently had the honor of recognizing the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Roy ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù DeLauter a resident of Smithsburg Maryland. üßµ http
RepDavidTrone,Great news! Over 6.5 million federal dollars will be invested into the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. @user Chesapeake Bay Oyster Recovery Program and Environmental Restoration and Protection Program are vital in making the Bay and our state better for our kids and grandkids.
RepDavidTrone,Economic projections by @user show that our budget deficit will fall by $1.7 trillion‚Äîthe largest in US history‚Äîand inflation is cooling off. Thanks to @user and the #AmericanRescuePlan we are strengthening our economy and helping hardworking Americans.https://t.co/nYxaFO8SFn
RepDavidTrone,@user @user Over 85% of Americans support universal background checks on gun sales. That‚Äôs common sense. That‚Äôs a starting point. That‚Äôs what HR 8 which I proudly voted for LAST year would establish.
RepDavidTrone,My people know it üëá your people know it: it‚Äôs time to take action and pass common sense #GunReform. @user if we keep fighting together we CAN and WILL save lives. We‚Äôve got to keep holding the Gun Lobby‚Äôs feet to the fire. We can‚Äôt give up. And we won‚Äôt. http
RepDavidTrone,@user @user you‚Äôre making Maryland proud. If we keep fighting together we CAN and WILL effect change. Enough has been enough. I won‚Äôt stop fighting to save precious lives.
RepDavidTrone,I sat down with the Chief Advocacy Officer for @user to discuss #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth. Hannah really hit the nail on the head here. No one should be defined by their mental illness and no one should feel ashamed to ask for help. It's ok to not be ok. http
RepDavidTrone,This week @user and I sent a letter to @user urging his administration to enact our recommendations from the Commission on Combating Synthetic #Opioid Trafficking. Americans need their people in power firing on all cylinders to end this crisis. http
RepDavidTrone,This week #TeamMaryland secured nearly $200 million to support small businesses and spur economic growth in Maryland through the @user State Small Business Credit Initiative Program. We can never do enough to support Maryland's small businesses.https://t.co/fnRWqWQY5q
RepDavidTrone,How many more children have to die? How many more parents have to mourn? How many more times do we have to have this conversation? Enough is enough. 84% of voters support background checks. It's time to #StopGunViolence. If the Senate won't act we must act in November.
RepDavidTrone,Americans are fed up with Congress and its failure to act on commonsense #GunReform‚Äîand rightfully so. HR 8 which requires universal background checks passed the House in March 2021 but it's stuck in the Senate because too many folks won't stand up to the gun lobby. http
