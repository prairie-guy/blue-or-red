FrankPallone,The U.S. is falling behind as the world works to address the #ClimateCrisis and transition to clean energy. It’s unconscionable that Republican leadership continues to reject science even as it unfolds right before their eyes.I’m still determined to see us lead by example. http
FrankPallone,Hopefully talks in the Senate can lead to concrete action to address gun violence in our nation. It's been over a year since @user passed legislation to require a background check on every gun sale &amp; to close loopholes that allow dangerous people to obtain firearms. http
FrankPallone,It was great to join state and local leaders today in South Amboy to mark an important milestone in the South Amboy ferry. It will provide a new way to commute between Central Jersey and New York City reduce traffic congestion and bolster our region’s economy. http
FrankPallone,Turkey cannot and should not be seen as a key U.S. ally. We’ve seen Erdogan betray our NATO values time and time again. We should not hesitate to call out his flagrant human rights abuses and antidemocratic practices.https://t.co/wAen2lptq7
FrankPallone,The New Brunswick and Highland Park Memorial Day parade included stops at two significant veterans memorials. The Civil War Memorial at Monument Park in New Brunswick and the Doughboy Statue depicting a World War I soldier in uniform in Highland Park. http

FrankPallone,Freedom and democracy should be a priority in Belarus as Belarusians continue to suffer at the hands of Lukashenko – a cruel authoritarian and an accomplice to Putin's war in Ukraine. The U.S. must stand with the people of Belarus and hold Lukashenko accountable.
FrankPallone,Beautiful day for Long Branch’s annual art festival at West End Park. Lots of pictures for sale with local scenes of the Jersey Shore. http
FrankPallone,Happy Memorial Day Weekend – the unofficial beginning of summer here at the Jersey Shore! If you're coming to visit please celebrate responsibly and support our local small businesses!
FrankPallone,Not even a week after another tragic mass shooting Republicans gathered at the NRA convention to reject Democrats' efforts to enact commonsense gun violence prevention legislation. It's outrageous that they are blocking initiatives that the vast majority of Americans support. http
FrankPallone,Great news! Entry to all New Jersey state parks forests and recreation areas is free for the summer beginning this weekend! http

FrankPallone,In the wake of the tragic shooting in Buffalo @user passed legislation to help federal agencies coordinate against domestic terrorism threats. 203 Republicans voted against this critical legislation in the House and now they're blocking it in the Senate. Shameful. http
FrankPallone,I'm committed to gun violence prevention. The House has passed commonsense legislation that would help keep our children safe but unfortunately these bills are stalled by Senate Republicans. @HouseDemocrats will continue working to prevent these senseless tragedies.
FrankPallone,Join me now for my weekly update! #FridayswithFrankhttps://t.co/Yn3ggvqWxq
FrankPallone,In my meeting with @user today I congratulated them on their historic unionization &amp; reiterated my support for their right to organize.  It's absurd that Amazon rakes in billions in profits but fails to provide their workers with good wages &amp; safe working conditions.
FrankPallone,A new report finds that my #NoSurprises Act legislation protected consumers from receiving more than 2 million surprise medical bills in just the first two months of this year! http

FrankPallone,Erdogan continues to obstruct the advancement of our collective values by putting preconditions on Finland and Sweden's admission to NATO. Erdogan is the one who has supported terrorism and used aggression in violation of international law – not Finland and Sweden. http
FrankPallone,I'm encouraged by @user conversation with Armenia PM @user The U.S. should continue to play an active role to facilitate peace and security in the region but we should not hesitate to call out Azerbaijan for their unprovoked aggression in Artsakh. http
FrankPallone,Today I held a hearing as part of our all-hands-on-deck national response to address the baby formula shortage. I'm going to do everything I can to ensure America’s babies have safe and nutritious formula and that a situation like this never happens again. http
