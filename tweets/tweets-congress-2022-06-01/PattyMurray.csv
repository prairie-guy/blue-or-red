PattyMurray,My legislation to ban surprise medical bills has already helped millions of patients keep more money in their pockets. I’ll keep working to build on this progress with more steps to lower health care costs for families. http
PattyMurray,If you’ve tried to rent or buy a home in Washington state you know just how high prices have gotten.I’ve fought to secure more funds for our state to build more affordable housing and I’ll keep working to lower the cost of housing for everyone in our state.
PattyMurray,I know firsthand the difference it makes when students get the support they need to pursue a higher education. The resources I secured will help colleges &amp; universities better support students with low incomes &amp; first-gen students on their path to success. http
PattyMurray,Today we honor the brave women and men—and their families—who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our country.We will always remember the servicemembers who lost their lives defending our freedoms. #MemorialDay
PattyMurray,We don’t have to live in a country where gun violence is a regular occurrence. This is a solvable problem.Republicans need the courage—&amp; the decency &amp; basic concern for the lives of our kids—to work with Democrats on common-sense gun safety reforms. That’s not asking for a lot.
PattyMurray,Republicans want women to have fewer rights.That’s unthinkable. Women across the country deserve the right and the opportunity to make their own decisions about their bodies families and futures.
PattyMurray,I started my career in politics as a parent advocate fighting to save my local preschool program. I know firsthand how important the work parent advocates like @user are doing in WA state.I'm doing everything I can to support you and get my child care plan passed. http
PattyMurray,If you’re having trouble finding baby formula in Washington state @user has helpful resources and answers to common questions.I am doing all that I can on the federal level to solve this and get babies fed. http
PattyMurray,Our kids should feel safe at school but how can they when active shooter drills are as routine as recess?We can’t allow them to live like this—we’ve got to pass common-sense gun safety laws. http
PattyMurray,Oklahoma just put in place the most extreme abortion ban in the country. I asked @user what this dangerous and cruel law means for the people in her state—particularly women of color and those with the tightest budgets. http
PattyMurray,Unless we do something the climate crisis is only going to get worse.So my message to anti-science Senate Republicans is clear: stop standing in the way of action.
PattyMurray,When the Supreme Court overturns #RoeVWade abortion will be restricted—or out-right banned—for women in half the states across the country.Extreme politicians have got to stop standing in the way of people’s right to make their own decisions about their families.
PattyMurray,It’s so important we’re doing everything we can to keep people in Washington state safe and healthy.Thanks to @user for giving me an update on our state’s public health and how I can continue to support his team’s work. http
PattyMurray,Great to see @user out here in the other Washington.Whether it’s tackling the affordable housing crisis or securing more resources to help people facing mental health challenges there’s so much we have to keep working together on to build a better Seattle. http
PattyMurray,It was an honor to introduce Tiffany Cartwright at a @user hearing.I proudly recommended her to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of WA. She has dedicated her career to advancing civil rights—&amp; that's exactly what we need on the bench. http
PattyMurray,After a really challenging two years we need to get families back on solid financial footing and help people put more money in their savings and retirement accounts. The bipartisan legislation I’m working on with @user is an important part of that work. http
PattyMurray,.@RepKimSchrier &amp; I spoke with a local mother and food bank managers from across WA state about the infant formula shortage &amp; what they need.I pressed FDA to do more at a hearing I led earlier today. It’s unacceptable we ever got to this point &amp; I’m fighting for solutions. http
PattyMurray,Yesterday marked 2 years since the murder of George Floyd. The Biden Admin took strong steps to keep us safe and build public trust in policing—but Congress needs to do its part to pass policing reform that will root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system.
PattyMurray,Passing legislation to address homegrown extremism—and white supremacists in particular—was a chance to stand united against hatred and violence of all kinds. By blocking this bill Senate Republicans failed to do the bare minimum. http
PattyMurray,I’ll say it a thousand times more: Republicans will not stop at overturning Roe. They’re prepared to go to the end of the Earth to rip away every woman’s right to make her own decisions about if &amp; when to start a family. We must keep fighting back with every tool at our disposal.
PattyMurray,Oklahoma is now the first state to enact a complete abortion ban—from the moment of fertilization—a downright cruel policy that will force every woman in the state including those who might not even know they are pregnant to carry their pregnancy to term.
PattyMurray,Mac from Richland WA contacted my office last week searching for the special formula his daughter needs. His family traveled thousands of miles for six cans. I know parents will go to great lengths to get formula for their kids—but they shouldn’t have to. http
PattyMurray,I know parents in WA state and across the country won’t rest easy until there is formula back on shelves and until they can feed their kids—and I won’t rest either. We need a coordinated response to fix this crisis and prevent it from ever happening again.
PattyMurray,The Biden Admin has taken some key steps to help fix this crisis. @user invoked the Defense Production Act to help get more formula manufactured “Operation Fly Formula” is bringing in formula &amp; FDA has taken steps as well. But let me be clear: this all happened way too late.
PattyMurray,I will not allow FDA to continue spinning its wheels on something as important as the food that families feed their children. I’ve pressed @user for answers—and will do so again here today—but I haven’t seen a plan yet.
PattyMurray,.@SenBobCasey &amp; I pressed for answers immediately after Abbott’s recall. My office has continued pressing Abbott and FDA about issues related to the recall—including the supply of infant formula—but still action was slow and information hasn’t been forthcoming.
PattyMurray,When it comes to helping the families &amp; caretakers that depend on formula @user &amp; formula manufacturers all get an “F” in my book.There were plenty of warning signs for FDA &amp; Abbott about this crisis even last September.
PattyMurray,LIVE: I’m leading a Senate HELP Committee hearing on the nationwide infant formula shortage.Let me be clear: the fact we even have to have this hearing and shelves are empty is a massive unacceptable failure. Families need answers and solutions. http
PattyMurray,I have come to the floor of the Senate countless times to call for action to keep our kids and families safe from gun violence just to have Republicans block our efforts again and again. But we can't give up. I'm not going to.
PattyMurray,If we want to get at the heart of really stopping gun violence I beg my colleagues to pull their heads out of the sand and finally start talking about what can really address this crisis of gun violence: common-sense gun safety legislation—and there’s no getting around it.
PattyMurray,Some Republicans will say this is a mental health issue.I want to make this clear: the majority of people with mental illness do not commit violence against others. Treating gun violence as a mental health issue—rather than a gun issue—will never get us to the root cause.
PattyMurray,Some Republicans have suggested arming teachers. Can they hear themselves? Teachers didn’t sign up to be soldiers and guns have no place in our classrooms. And we shouldn't have to ask them to do so.
PattyMurray,Every time another mass shooting happens Republicans stand in the way of any meaningful action. That’s not just unthinkable—it’s unacceptable.We don’t have to live like this—it's a solvable problem. And yet Republicans won't even let us DEBATE gun safety legislation.
PattyMurray,A lot of people have characterized this tragedy as unthinkable. That's not true.Parents and kids in Washington state and across the country think about this all the time.What's unthinkable is that every time this happens nothing changes.
PattyMurray,Nineteen children and two teachers—at an elementary school—were killed yesterday.The shooting at Robb Elementary School is heartbreaking. I'm live on the Senate floor demanding more than thoughts and prayers—I'm demanding action. http
