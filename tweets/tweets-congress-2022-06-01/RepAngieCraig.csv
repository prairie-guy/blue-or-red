RepAngieCraig,This week @user opened applications for Capacity Grants for Rural &amp; Underserved Communities which will help direct resources toward increasing access to home and community-based health care in underserved areas. Learn more here: http
RepAngieCraig,Today marks the beginning of Pride Month a time to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community and honor those who have dedicated their lives to fighting for equality. So from my family to yours happy Pride! http
RepAngieCraig,This year several pieces of legislation have been introduced to ban Members of Congress from owning and trading stocks while in office. None of these have been brought to the floor for a vote. It‚Äôs time to vote. http
RepAngieCraig,It was great to participate in both the Northfield and Cottage Grove Memorial Day ceremonies today. We remember and honor the veterans who gave all for our nation. http
RepAngieCraig,Today is Memorial Day ‚Äì a day to honor the veterans and those Gold Star families who made the ultimate sacrifice for this great nation. I wish everyone in #MN02 a peaceful and safe Memorial Day. http
RepAngieCraig,Friendly reminder that your representatives should be in Congress to represent you‚Äì not to become lobbyists after they leave Congress. That‚Äôs why I introduced a bill to ban former Members from doing just that. http
RepAngieCraig,That's why I joined my colleague @user in introducing the CBD Product Safety and Standardization Act to accomplish this across the country. And I will continue to call on the Senate to take up the MORE Act to finally legalize adult-use cannabis.
RepAngieCraig,I‚Äôm glad to see new legal clarity for CBD producers and sales in MN. This is vital to keeping legitimate businesses out of legal limbo. http
RepAngieCraig,Glad I got a chance to meet with Region 5 @user Administrator @user to discuss environmental issues in Minnesota and what Congress can do to protect the natural gifts that our state is blessed with. Thanks for meeting with me ‚Äì and for all of your hard work
RepAngieCraig,Yes I am frustrated. We shouldn‚Äôt be delaying these commonsense reforms even a day longer! A ban on stock ownership could finally help restore some desperately-needed faith in Congress. Let‚Äôs get it done. https://t.co/eEAP4XkHgF
RepAngieCraig,This week I was proud to accept an award for my work to address childhood myopia which has only been exacerbated by increased screen time during the pandemic. It‚Äôs critical we do more to learn about and address these growing concerns. Learn more: http http
RepAngieCraig,Always great to see new jobs and economic growth in #MN02. Today I was excited to see some of that growth in action at the groundbreaking of a new logistics park in Cottage Grove! Thanks for inviting me @user http
RepAngieCraig,This is great to see! I‚Äôm so glad @user is helping preserve Minnesota wildlife especially important pollinators like butterflies. ü¶ã https://t.co/5oUPhA16xc
RepAngieCraig,The federal age to purchase a handgun is 21 years old. The federal age to buy an assault rifle is 18. Does that make sense?Raising this age to create federal parity would be a first step toward saving lives.
RepAngieCraig,No one should have to ration a life-sustaining drug because they can‚Äôt afford it. These flaws are exactly why I support legislation to reduce the cost of insulin cap out-of-pocket spending for seniors and allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. http
RepAngieCraig,High gas prices are stretching families‚Äô budgets. Here's how I'm working to lower the cost: ‚úîÔ∏è Called for a gas tax holiday that could lower prices by 48 cents per gallon.‚úîÔ∏è Helped suspend a ban on summer sales of E15‚úîÔ∏è Voted to protect consumers from Big Oil‚Äôs price gouging http
RepAngieCraig,Two years ago George Floyd was murdered in MN. I'm glad to see @user honor his memory by working toward a more just law enforcement system and supporting our police officers so that they can protect public safety in our communities. We must do both. http
RepAngieCraig,They‚Äôre right @user It‚Äôs time for the White House to support a ban on stock trading for Members of Congress. Americans deserve the peace of mind of knowing that their Representatives are working for them ‚Äì not their portfolios. http
