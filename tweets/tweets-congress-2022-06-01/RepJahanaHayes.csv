RepJahanaHayes,@user I introduced legislation that does that- Supporting Trauma Informed Education Practices Act. My Republican colleagues in Cmte voted No.The answer to everything can‚Äôt be No.
RepJahanaHayes,That‚Äôs a reality that teachers would have to think about if they are expected to be armed and respond in a school shooting. In more than half of the cases- the shooter was a current/former student or a member of the community.
