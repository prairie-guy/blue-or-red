RepKinzinger,To celebrate #MemorialDay is to remember and honor our fallen heroesâ€”those who gave the last full measure of devotion in service to this great nation. Today Iâ€™m thinking of my friend Capt. Andreas Oâ€™Keeffe and countless others whoâ€™ve made the ultimate sacrifice. #HonorThem
RepKinzinger,Cheers to our friends in Georgia on 31 years of regained independence! The Georgian people know all too well the devastation Ukraine is facing against Russiaâ€™s aggression. We stand firmly in support of the sovereignty of these two nations &amp; value our continued friendship. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
RepKinzinger,Last week I spoke with @user about the massacre in Buffalo. One week and here we are again. We cannot ignore this; we cannot continue to feed people a steady diet of fear &amp; anger and not expect dangerous outcomes. http
