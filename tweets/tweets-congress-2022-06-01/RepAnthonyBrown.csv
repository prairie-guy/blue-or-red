RepAnthonyBrown,You have to be 21 to purchase a handgun or alcohol. Why should a semiautomatic be any different?Detractors have no response so they resort to lies attacking transgender Americans bigotry and bad faith. Don‚Äôt get distracted. Stay focused on action to save lives. http
RepAnthonyBrown,2 mass shootings in less than 2 weeks by 2 18-year-olds who purchased these deadly weapons legally. It‚Äôs time for action!It‚Äôs time to #RaiseTheAge it's time to pass national #RedFlagLaws and universal background checks.I joined @user on @user to discuss. http
RepAnthonyBrown,Our country‚Äôs story and that of our military are diverse with men and women from different races and backgrounds coming together to serve something larger than themselves.That‚Äôs our true power heritage and history which we should honor. It‚Äôs time.https://t.co/CtC4uFuIkN
RepAnthonyBrown,Sharing the stories of diverse Americans will help us tell a more complete story of our country and those who have fought to defend it.https://t.co/CzEFgYsyt2
RepAnthonyBrown,In 1865 locals spent more than a week cleaning up gravesites organizing them into clean rows and building a fence around the cemetery for protection. For a final touch they laid flowers upon the newly-established graves üíêHence #DecorationDay
RepAnthonyBrown,Originally called #DecorationDay freed Black people in Charleston SC organized an event to pay homage to the countless Black soldiers who valiantly fought in the Civil War and died nameless and without proper burials. http
RepAnthonyBrown,While nowadays #MemorialDay honors veterans from all American wars the observance has its roots in the Antebellum South. http
RepAnthonyBrown,On #MemorialDay we pause to remember generations of servicemembers of every race origin religion and creed who lost their lives in service to our country.We are forever indebted to them for their bravery and courage and that of their families. http
RepAnthonyBrown,Now how does that make sense? *rhetorical question*The math ain‚Äôt mathin‚Äô ü§î http
RepAnthonyBrown,@user @user @user @user AMEN sis!‚ÄîACW http
RepAnthonyBrown,If you or someone you know is struggling reach out. We're in this together and you have a community ready to embrace and support you in this journey.https://t.co/MEMVuffOyo
RepAnthonyBrown,We know that there‚Äôs still more work to do.Studies demonstrate that there is a direct correlation b/t poverty (&amp; all of the complications that come with it) and poor #MentalHealth addiction &amp; in extreme cases death by suicide. We need to do more to tear down these barriers.
RepAnthonyBrown,In the past society has done a poor job of understanding mental health leaving generations of Americans with deficits in care. Gratefully we have more readily embraced #MentalHealth and rejected the stigmas applied to mental illness and mental health challenges.
RepAnthonyBrown,Every May for 73 years Americans have been coming together for #MentalHealthAwareness Month to acknowledge the importance of #MentalHealth wellness provide support for those most affected and embrace developments in this field of study #MHAM #Together4MH http

RepAnthonyBrown,#MD04 where do you stand? Do you support the #RaiseTheAge Act?Vote and sound off below!
RepAnthonyBrown,New @user data shows that the vast majority of Americans support federal action raising the lawful age of purchasing a long military-style #AssaultWeapon from 18-years-old to 21-years-old just like handguns.This is the first step towards commonsense legislation. http
RepAnthonyBrown,@user @user @user @user Thank you for sounding off Mr. Shabazz.By wiping the clean slate Black Americans who‚Äôve accumulated debt (not limited to Millennials and Gen X) Black Americans will have the opportunity to:üí∞Save for retirementüí∞Own property + build equityüí∞Start familiesJTNAF‚ÄîACW
RepAnthonyBrown,I share @user Chair @user belief that canceling #StudentLoanDebt would be a directly impactful way to tackle systemic economic inequities and close the #RacialWealthGap.I joined @user on #PoliticsNation to discuss. http
RepAnthonyBrown,The devastating losses continue to compound. Four children left behind. The tragedy in #Uvalde has left too many families shattered and a community and country in mourning. We can overcome this and we can heal‚Ä¶If we have the courage to act. http
RepAnthonyBrown,HARD AGREE! http http
RepAnthonyBrown,@user That‚Äôs right Congresswoman Spanberger.For those who may not know in the 90s handguns were deemed more dangerous tuan #AssaultWeapons because they were used by Black and Latino men.As a result this loophole exists and young people are able to commit these horrific crimes.
RepAnthonyBrown,Thank you for your support Congresswoman Dean. As you said we have to move towards safeguarding American lives NOW. We cannot wait! http
RepAnthonyBrown,Raising the age to buy these deadly weapons is as commonsense as it gets.Read More:https://t.co/ZhjcIZUX7j
RepAnthonyBrown,During the last couple weeks we saw two 18-years use legally purchased weapons to commit mass murder. These glaring loopholes benefit the gun lobby and are killing Americans.That‚Äôs why I introduced the bipartisan Raise the Age Act with @user
RepAnthonyBrown,Under current federal law you must be 21-years-old to legally purchase a handgun but only 18-years-old to purchase a long military-style semi-automatic rifle. That disparity is wrong and it is dangerous.
RepAnthonyBrown,We‚Äôre elected to improve society and protect American rights. We must get serious about #GunViolenceProtection and securing a federal law to #BanAssaultWeapons. http
RepAnthonyBrown,#GunViolence numbers are trending upward across the country. Alongside @user and our colleagues I‚Äôm standing up for our children!Americans deserve more than just ‚ÄúThoughts and Prayers‚Äù. http
RepAnthonyBrown,#GunViolence is the #1 cause of death among American children. In 2020 4357 children were shot and killed. Every child deserves to be safe in their school. Every family deserves to send their children to school without the fear of a massacre. http
RepAnthonyBrown,Every time these crimes don‚Äôt result in real accountability and real policy change‚Äîwe‚Äîelected officials‚Äîsend a message that the lives of our victims are dispensable.I don‚Äôt accept that. We‚Äôre elected to improve society.The solution is clear: #RaiseTheAge #BanAssaultWeapons http
RepAnthonyBrown,After a mass shooting in their state Florida Republicans raised the age to buy assault weapons to 21 years old. @user do you have the courage to do the same? It‚Äôs your responsibility to act to keep kids safe and you can do that today. http
RepAnthonyBrown,Too often radicalized and indoctrinated young men like the men in #Buffalo and #Uvalde are able to commit race-based crimes because of our permissive and loophole-ridden patchwork of gun laws.Read my op-ed published by @user
RepAnthonyBrown,As a result a loophole exists that allows Americans to purchase long military-style weapons as long as they‚Äôre 18-years-old and older.This policy like the Filibuster is rooted in prejudice and systemic racism. We need to #EndTheFilibuster to protect American lives.
RepAnthonyBrown,To understand how we got to this place we have to revisit the policies that set the stage for tragedies like #Buffalo and #Uvalde.In the 90s handguns were deemed more of a threat to our communities than #AssaultWeapons because they were used by Black and Latino men.
