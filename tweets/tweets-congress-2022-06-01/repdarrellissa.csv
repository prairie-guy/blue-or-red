repdarrellissa,Let’s be clear: Hillary Clinton is an unindicted co-conspirator in the planning and execution of the Russia Hoax and the damage it did to this country the last six years.No verdict by a jury of her donors can change that fact.
repdarrellissa,Studying a new poll showing Joe Biden’s approval rating at a low of 35%. He’s also underwater in 47 states — including New York  California and even Delaware.Maybe he is uniting the country.
repdarrellissa,Nobody is buying the White House blame game.Blaming Russia for Biden's record gas prices.Blaming the Fed for Biden's inflation crisis.Even blaming new moms for Biden's baby formula crisis.
repdarrellissa,The Biden White House staff would rather Tweet through all the crises they’ve created than work to solve them.
repdarrellissa,Memorial Day was first Decoration Day to mark the gravesites of those lost in our Civil War.It continues today as we honor all the fallen in all the battles that purchased our freedom and ensured the survival of liberty. Today is for those who gave all so America may endure.
repdarrellissa,The White House says “no one better” than Susan Rice to lead their gun control messaging.The architect of the Benghazi cover-up? I can’t think of anyone worse.
repdarrellissa,Obama AG Eric Holder lost any credibility on gun violence after his Fast and Furious operation led to a Border Patrol agent named Brian Terry being gunned down by a firearm he put into the hands of the cartels.
repdarrellissa,This is truly a time to support our brave police border patrol and first responders.
repdarrellissa,Disappointed to see President Biden so politically divisive last night. He could have united the nation. He chose not to.
