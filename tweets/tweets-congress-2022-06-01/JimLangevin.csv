JimLangevin,ICYMI - We unveiled Tina's Table at Kennedy Plaza last week! It's an accessible take on public seating that comfortably seats 3 wheelchair users so that we all have a seat at the table. Thank you to @user @user + @user for making this possible. http
JimLangevin,Our fallen heroes made sacrifices that we can never repay. But it is is our duty -- and great privilege -- to ensure that those service members are never forgotten and that their loved ones never grieve alone.It was an honor to join Rhode Island's Gold Star Families today. http
JimLangevin,On this day we honor the selfless and courageous men and women who gave their lives in service of our great nation. May we cherish our freedom each and every day and may we never forget its true cost.
JimLangevin,There is no one solution that will address every act of gun violence but doing nothing is unconscionable. Together this series of actions is an actionable common-sense approach to keeping our schools grocery stores malls concert venues and communities safer. http
JimLangevin,3‚É£  @user has been without a director since 2015.  We cannot enforce the gun laws we already have without effective leadership at ATF.  The Senate must confirm Steve Dettelbach NOW.
JimLangevin,2‚É£  Close the Charleston Loophole Licensed sellers are required to run background checks but if that background check can't be completed within 3 days the firearm can be transferred anyway.  The Senate can pass H.R. 1446 the Enhanced Background Checks Act to fix that.
JimLangevin,@user @user @user 1‚É£ Close the Gun Show Loophole Unlicensed sellers can transfer a firearm without running a background check.90% of Americans agree that has to change.The Senate can pass H.R. 8 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act to require ALL gun sales to include a background check.
JimLangevin,Today we're talking about guns.  Here are 3 things the Senate could do right now to make our country safer if Republicans were willing to work with Democrats on enacting common-sense policies widely supported by the American people./üßµ http
JimLangevin,@user @user @user She's beautiful just like her mom. Congratulations Ted and Kim!
JimLangevin,Gun violence is now the leading cause of death among children and teenagers. When car crashes were their leading cause of death we decided that wasn't acceptable. We changed the laws and made cars safer.  It's long past time for us to do the same with guns.
