ChrisVanHollen,Putin thought he was untouchable … he was very wrong. These additional EU sanctions &amp; steps toward a Russian oil import ban are important but we must beef up our efforts to prevent other countries from circumventing these collective efforts. http
ChrisVanHollen,Investing in the @user means more good-paying MD jobs &amp; a smoother transport of goods from ship to shelf. With this $15M fed investment the Port can make much-needed improvements to its infrastructure &amp; safety. A big win for the Port &amp; all MDers. http

ChrisVanHollen,Congratulations to the @user on their national championship! Fear the Turtle! https://t.co/M4RHtKRkPZ

ChrisVanHollen,Two years ago today our nation witnessed the murder of George Floyd. @user new EO is an important 1st step to address the use of excessive force but to make lasting progress we must still enact the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. http
