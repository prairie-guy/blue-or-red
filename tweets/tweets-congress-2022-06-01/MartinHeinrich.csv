MartinHeinrich,Yesterday I visited the Whitfield Conservation Area to get an update on their recovery from April’s Big Hole Fire. The work they are doing here is a great example of how we can manage and recover from fires in this new climate reality. http
MartinHeinrich,New Mexico’s extreme fire conditions make it clear: We are in a new climate reality.I’m proud to have worked with the @user and @user to make this partnership between @user and Kirtland AFB possible &amp; provide major updates that strengthen our fire response. http
MartinHeinrich,U.S. oil companies made record profits while workers and families foot the bill: ➡️Exxon Mobil: Doubled profits from last year➡️Chevron: Highest quarterly profit in 10 years➡️Shell: Highest quarterly profit ever We’ve got to hold the Big Oil CEOs accountable.
MartinHeinrich,I will continue to secure important investments to make our communities whole from this disaster support our wildland firefighters and strengthen critical forest and watershed restoration work.
MartinHeinrich,But it's also painfully clear that what may have served us well a decade or two ago will have to evolve. It's time for the Forest Service to update all their prescriptions/management tools to account for a windier dryer reality to prevent this kind of disaster from reoccurring.
MartinHeinrich,There's no doubt the warming climate is fueling the extremely dry &amp; windy conditions that have made our wildfire seasons so much more dangerous. In this new reality we will need every tool available in order to reduce fuel loads and the chances of catastrophic wildfire behavior.
MartinHeinrich,These record-breaking wildfires have displaced thousands from their homes and continue to take a costly toll on our forests and communities. New Mexicans are exhausted frustrated and want answers.
MartinHeinrich,It is critical for the U.S. Forest Service to take full responsibility for its decisions and provide the public with transparency about its actions. Releasing these findings is a first step in that direction.https://t.co/Prz29juuMp
MartinHeinrich,This is an alarming report.I asked the USDA Office of Inspector General to look into these claims last year. They need to conduct a full-scale investigation. Fish &amp; Wildlife should not be making decisions to remove wolves based on completely faulty data.https://t.co/RuAPqmYxz4
MartinHeinrich,Countless New Mexicans have sacrificed in service to our country—from WWII's Navajo Code Talkers &amp; Bataan Death March Survivors to Korea Vietnam Iraq &amp; Afghanistan veterans. On #MemorialDay we honor our fallen heroes and recognize those who continue to serve at home &amp; abroad.
MartinHeinrich,What and who are driving inflation.https://t.co/548iLNC4kj
MartinHeinrich,We’ve got to crack down on the outrageous price gouging by big oil CEOs. And we need to make electric vehicles more affordable.Ending our reliance on dirty fossil fuels is not just a climate imperative—it’s an economic imperative for American families.https://t.co/wl8KeY4Xss
MartinHeinrich,I’m working with @user and a bipartisan group of Senators to find a path forward to address gun violence. We cannot let this tragic violence continue.
MartinHeinrich,I am a sportsman and I believe in protecting the rights of law abiding gun owners. I am also a father and I believe our kids deserve action. There need to be changes in our gun laws. We must find agreement on policies to reduce this senseless violence.
MartinHeinrich,Yes. I support a ban on assault weapons. And I want to make sure it bans the mechanisms that make certain guns more dangerous than others permanently. http
MartinHeinrich,I’m done with the thoughts and prayers and waiting. Let’s get to the table and have productive reasonable conversations on policy. These tragedies can’t keep happening.
MartinHeinrich,Bottom line: All the fossil fuels we’ve been combusting for the past 100 years are the reason these fires are so severe. We have got to speed the transition to clean energy.https://t.co/SYSZ609i7T
