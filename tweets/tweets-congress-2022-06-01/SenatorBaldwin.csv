SenatorBaldwin,Great to join @user to announce this federal investment in Milwaukee's workforce. Delivering results to rebuild our water infrastructure. http
SenatorBaldwin,Water Infrastructure doesn’t rebuild itself—we need more trained and skilled workers to do it and that is why I worked to deliver $2 million in federal funding for a partnership between @user and @MKEWaterWorks to boost job training. http
SenatorBaldwin,The @user Success Center and the @user Center for Peacemaking are working together to support Milwaukee students with the Building Resiliency in Classroom Education program. Thanks to @user and @user for your leadership I'm proud to be a partner. http
SenatorBaldwin,It was great to visit Green Bay Avenue Elementary to meet with educators about the federal funding I brought home to support the partnership between @user and @user to support students struggling with mental health academic and behavioral challenges. http
SenatorBaldwin,In 2018 I introduced the FARMERS FIRST Act and worked to get it signed into law. With grants through @user we are providing support for Wisconsin farmers to address mental health issues. There is still a need to do more and working together we can do it. https://t.co/Iv7q7HdLpT
SenatorBaldwin,I'm honored to have an opportunity to work with Wisconsinites on behalf of patriotic women who served and sacrificed for our country in such a heroic way during World War II. My bipartisan legislation  recognizes respects and rewards their brave service. http
SenatorBaldwin,I was honored to join the community today for #MemorialDay services at Wood National Cemetery to honor and respect the sacrifice of those who have served our country. http
SenatorBaldwin,Today we remember brave and heroic Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice. Let us join together to honor and respect their service to our country and make sure we keep their families in our hearts as they carry the loss of a loved one. #MemorialDay http
SenatorBaldwin,Thanks to ⁦@USDA⁩ ⁦@DepSecBronaugh⁩ for coming to America’s Dairyland for a great meeting with Wisconsin farmers and agriculture leaders about our efforts working together to support mental health.  http
SenatorBaldwin,Senate Republicans just voted against the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act blocking a debate about racially motivated hate crimes White supremacy violent extremism and gun violence in America. Instead of doing something they choose to do nothing today.
SenatorBaldwin,The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act gives every Senator an opportunity to be very clear about where they stand on supporting law enforcement efforts to take on racially motivated hate crimes White supremacy and violent extremism. Let's take action and pass #DTPA today.
SenatorBaldwin,We need to stand up against racially motivated hate crimes White supremacy violent extremism and the racist conspiracy theories like the ‘Great Replacement Theory’ that fuel these attacks. We need to pass the the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act today. #DTPA
SenatorBaldwin,From Oak Creek a decade ago to Buffalo this month the attacks and threat posed by White supremacists and other violent domestic extremists cannot be ignored. We need to take action. #DTPA
SenatorBaldwin,Today the Senate is voting on the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act to address the growing domestic terrorism threat in America. I am voting for it because we must do more to confront violent extremists motivated by White supremacy. #DTPA
SenatorBaldwin,We cannot accept doing nothing every time this happens. I support passing legislation in the Senate that puts in place universal background checks for all gun sales. http
