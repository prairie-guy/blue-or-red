SenatorHagerty,226 years ago the great state of TN was born. Since that day our state has transformed into a leader in agriculture business technology &amp; a community rooted in timeless tradition. I'm grateful to call it home &amp; it's my honor to represent it in Washington. Happy Birthday TN! http
SenatorHagerty,Every step this Administration has taken has been toward more inflation yet they refuse to take responsibility.
SenatorHagerty,Americans cannot afford Joe Biden’s economic policies. http
SenatorHagerty,From historic inflation to a collapsed southern border and emboldened adversaries we have crises erupting across the nation and around the globe precipitated by the Biden Administration.
SenatorHagerty,We still have a massive crisis at the southern border. The biggest killer of young Americans between the ages of 18 and 45 right now in America is overdose deaths primarily from fentanyl coming across the border. But the Biden Administration will not acknowledge it. http
SenatorHagerty,The world is a more dangerous place thanks to Joe Biden. And what does he do? Blame Americans.
SenatorHagerty,Today on #MemorialDay join me in remembering our Nation's heroes who put their lives on the line for the country they deeply loved. May their love of country reignite our own may their selflessness inspire generosity &amp; may their great sacrifice give rise to great gratitude. http
SenatorHagerty,Sen. Bill Hagerty: Lifting Title 42 will turn a crisis into a 'massive disaster' | @user http
SenatorHagerty,We need to return to the Trump-era immigration policies that were actually working. Then we would have a tremendous impact on reducing this border crisis. But instead people are just piling up on the other side of the border. http

SenatorHagerty,Biden Dems ‘shoved’ Americans ‘off the cliff’ with bad policies: Sen. Hagerty | @user http
SenatorHagerty,When will enough be enough? President Biden put an end to this crisis and secure our border! http
SenatorHagerty,A pernicious tax on EVERY American. http
SenatorHagerty,Ford &amp; SK Innovation’s Blue Oval City project ranked #1 for top American deals for 2021 bringing almost 6k jobs to TN. I’m grateful for the deep ties between our domestic &amp; Indo-Pacific partners &amp; will continue working to bring manufacturing home to TN.https://t.co/VTKBgenznT
SenatorHagerty,Americans are feeling more pain at the pump than ever because of Biden’s war on American energy. We need to return to energy independence now!
SenatorHagerty,If Biden lifts tariffs on China it won't help inflation; it will give up our negotiating posture with China.That's the typical policy of the Biden Administration—to appease and to capitulate and get nothing in return for America. http
SenatorHagerty,I’ve been saying it for over a year and I’ll say it again—Biden needs to secure our southern border. http

SenatorHagerty,We have people in Memphis that can't find formula for their children people in Knoxville that can't gas their tank up because it's too expensive. We have real problems here—precipitated by the Biden Admin—yet they're rushing to take care of problems overseas.
SenatorHagerty,If the Biden Administration does away with Title 42 we're going to see a tsunami of people coming in. It's a crisis that will turn into a massive disaster. http
SenatorHagerty,President Biden’s weak leadership and capitulation has made our world a much more dangerous place. http
SenatorHagerty,Inflation is running rampant and it's so obvious what's causing it: it's the policies of the Biden Administration.
SenatorHagerty,The best thing that Biden could do right now is stop the war that he's waged on American energy. But Biden will not do that. Biden will not be serious &amp; it's taken us in a very bad direction. http

SenatorHagerty,Thank you to Buffalo River Truss for continuing to invest in our state and create good jobs for hardworking Tennesseans! http
SenatorHagerty,Biden's war on American energy has driven prices up all over the country—now over $4 a gallon everywhere in America. The sad thing is the answer is right in front of us: get America back into the energy business. http
SenatorHagerty,1292 pounds of fentanyl—which killed more than 100000 Americans last year—was seized at our southern border in April—a more than 420% increase compared to April 2020. This is a crisis and Biden needs to address it now. http
SenatorHagerty,In just 15 months Joe Biden and Democrats have shoved us off the cliff in terms of what's happened to our economy our southern border and our reputation globally.https://t.co/Xowqvc8Gnw

SenatorHagerty,Joining #kudlow on @user shortly to discuss President Biden’s failed foreign policy that’s emboldened our adversaries around the globe. Tune in!
SenatorHagerty,Tone deaf and incredibly offensive to Americans struggling to fill up their tank.https://t.co/4rIDknSwiw
SenatorHagerty,The Biden Administration’s failing policies have caused historic inflation and are crushing the economy. I joined @user to discuss how lifting tariffs on China will be yet another disastrous decision by the Biden Admin. http
