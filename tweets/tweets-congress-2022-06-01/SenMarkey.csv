SenMarkey,I’m disappointed with FERC’s decision. ISO New England is supposed to be independent of the industry but clearly it’s just doing the bidding of fossil fuel companies that ravage our climate and cost consumers more on their energy bills. FERC is giving them the green light. http
SenMarkey,This is why I introduced the Environmental Justice Air Quality Monitoring Act which would authorize funding for the EPA to conduct hyperlocal air quality monitoring projects in environmental justice communities.
SenMarkey,Communities of color breathe dirtier air with pollutants varying up to 800% from one end of a city block to the next. Only by assessing air quality block-by-block can we ensure all Americans have clean and safe air regardless of their race ZIP code or income. http
SenMarkey,Taunton Public Schools are leading the nation in providing students the internet connectivity they need. Today I met with local leaders students and teachers at the @user to celebrate the $1733337 in federal emergency connectivity funding I helped deliver. http
SenMarkey,That’s why I included a provision in my CHARGE Act to ban these harmful practices by ISO-New England and system operators across the country in order to promote competition in wholesale markets while preserving reliability and affordability for customers.
SenMarkey,ISO-New England asked for two years to get its house in order to produce a reliable grid that meets our clean energy targets and doesn’t artificially raise rates. I’m going to continue to fight to make sure that our decarbonization goals aren’t delayed or denied. http
SenMarkey,I am proud to join the exceptional team from the @user in announcing $76.7 million in funding for the clean-up of New Bedford harbor. With this investment and powerful cross-government collaboration we will restore these waters for the people. http
SenMarkey,If Roe V. Wade is overturned information about app users' fertility browser history and location could become a data trove for those looking to target or intimidate people seeking an abortion. Apple and Google must prohibit apps from sharing this data. http
SenMarkey,Let us each pause and remember those we have lost in service of our country our values and our democracy this Memorial Day. Our duty is to honor their memory and work together to build a better nation and world worthy of their sacrifice.
SenMarkey,http
SenMarkey,The long term impacts of COVID-19 are incredibly serious and require substantial federal attention resources and funding. My colleagues and I are requesting  $125 million in the FY2023 budget to address these issues. http
SenMarkey,Americans deserve to know that food on the kitchen table is safe but right now the FDA is shirking its responsibility and manufacturers can self-regulate chemicals entering our food supply. Congress must restore confidence in the safety of our food. http
SenMarkey,The NRA is a goddamn disgrace. http
SenMarkey,Today I joined @user @user @user and countless activists and organizers to say enough is enough. Congress must pass gun safety legislation and end the epidemic of gun violence in our country now. http
SenMarkey,It’s a shameful but well-documented reality that the United States has long prioritized European Christian migrants. That must end. Refugees from Afghanistan and around the world facing persecution instability and violence should not face barriers that Ukrainians get to bypass.
SenMarkey,In just over a month the Biden administration approved 6000 Ukrainians for humanitarian parole but just 270 Afghan applicants have been approved. We urge @user to adopt an approach to Afghan refugees that mirrors the treatment of Ukrainians.https://t.co/DqzxEMXhsm
SenMarkey,Congress has a moral responsibility to address gun violence but Republicans refuse to act. I am standing with activists and advocates from @user to demand that we abolish the filibuster and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation now. http
