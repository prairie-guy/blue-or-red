RepLloydDoggett,Joined Hays County Women's Political Caucus to discuss the challenges we face in securing gun safety measures + protecting reproductive freedom. Now is the time to be engaged. We cannot replace the precious lives lost but we can replace those who refuse to protect our children. http
RepLloydDoggett,The GOP goal is to do as little as possible in response to the slaughter in Uvalde while making it appear to be something meaningful. Without a change in our elected officials in the Senate and elsewhere there will be no meaningful change in the level of gun violence.
RepLloydDoggett,All 50 GOP Senators declined an opportunity to discuss gun violence on Sunday’s national broadcast though this is usually a program that every member is eager to join. http
RepLloydDoggett,Manipulated visits will get us nowhere. We need independent investigators with unhindered access. Challenging to do business as usual with a dictatorial government whose violation of human rights is so brutal and appetite for expanding is so great.
RepLloydDoggett,Even with the faces of three thousand Uyghur prisoners and evidence of shoot-to-kill policies in their concentration camps the Chinese government continues to deny the genocide while cynically claiming their camps are “vocational schools.” BBC reports:https://t.co/Zrg3H9BXB2
RepLloydDoggett,While law enforcement’s delay in responding to children’s 911 calls cost lives in Uvalde the delay of Senator Mitch McConnell Governor Abbott and the Texas GOP in heeding the 911 calls for years from Mom’s Demand Action and other advocates continues to cost lives.
RepLloydDoggett,Today and every day let us remember those we've lost and reaffirm our commitment to the democracy and freedoms for which our veterans and their families have dearly sacrificed—a democracy which remains subject to serious threats at home and abroad. http
RepLloydDoggett,Strong Austin American Statesman editorial—truth telling about the failure of our State Republican leaders who fail to lead for the safety of our children.https://t.co/TDzius7pq9
RepLloydDoggett,On this Memorial Day as we honor those who made a necessary ultimate sacrifice for our country we are seeing too many unfortunate memorials to those innocents lost to gun violence. We call on our Republican leaders today to pledge allegiance to American families not to the NRA
RepLloydDoggett,The Indian American Coalition of Texas does such important work to defend and promote democracy in our community and beyond facilitating deeper civic engagement for all.
RepLloydDoggett,A wonderful evening celebrating democracy and diversity with the Indian American Coalition of Texas at the Asian American Resource Center. @user http
RepLloydDoggett,Anniversaries approach of prior massacres at the Pulse Nightclub in Florida Mother Emanuel in Charleston and so many other places.  Without meaningful action without Republican colleagues who free themselves from the NRA the pain the heartache the killing will continue.
RepLloydDoggett,In another week we will be voting on a number of gun safety bills as we again reach out to Republicans respectfully requesting them to stop their obstruction.
RepLloydDoggett,Just completing a meeting this Saturday afternoon with my colleagues on our Gun Violence Prevention Task Force of which I have long been a member.
RepLloydDoggett,This terrible American exceptionalism has made it possible for an 18-year-old to purchase an assault rifle legally (but not a beer) and kill quickly using weapons of war. Commonsense gun laws could prevent these all-too frequent tragedies.
RepLloydDoggett,Most other developed countries require at least a license to own a gun. That is not the case in the United States.https://t.co/ss41Gq3I5H
RepLloydDoggett,I strongly support a thorough complete and wholly independent investigation into the handling of the Uvalde tragedy before during and after this mass shooting.
RepLloydDoggett,In Australia a 1996 massacre that prompted mandatory buybacks means there has been one mass shooting in the past 26 years.Britain has one of the lowest gun-related deaths in the developed world.⬇️Read more here: http
RepLloydDoggett,To those who say mass shootings are unrelated to gun access: The data tells a different story.Restricting weapons of war like the AR-15 style semi-automatic used in Uvalde would lead to fewer deaths and to fewer grieving families in the wake of yet another massacre.
RepLloydDoggett,This bill would authorize and establish procedures for federal courts to issue extreme risk protection orders to prohibit a person from purchasing possessing or receiving a firearm or ammunition.
RepLloydDoggett,So long as weapons of war are more accessible than a driver’s license endless massacres will occur. My colleagues in the House and I are preparing to vote on and pass Congresswoman Lucy McBath’s bill the Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Act of 2021.
RepLloydDoggett,We cannot replace the precious lives lost in this senseless tragedy. But we can and we must take action to address the scourges of easy firearm access.⬇️
RepLloydDoggett,To change the law ultimately we must change the lawmakers. So long as weapons of war are more accessible than a driver’s license endless massacres will occur. http
RepLloydDoggett,Our Nation’s children deserve better. I support an assault weapons ban. My Deputy District Director Courtney spoke at the Texas Capitol—representing our office and as a mother herself. http
RepLloydDoggett,Powerful haunting images from @user at @user of Texas schoolchildren’s messages to the world. “We hope the Governor listens to us because we are scared.” http
RepLloydDoggett,President Biden’s executive order today makes some progress to provide better police accountability and bias training but the Senate must act on our comprehensive bill. http
RepLloydDoggett,Two years have passed since the horrific murder of George Floyd. Too many Black and Brown lives have been lost since then as Senate Republicans enabled by two Democrats refuse to pass the Justice in Policing Act approved in the House with my strong support over a year ago.
RepLloydDoggett,So long as Republicans serve the gun lobby and two Democrats facilitate their obstruction we can educate and seek accountability but we cannot stop the killing. We must turn anger into action—replacing those who refuse to protect our children.
RepLloydDoggett,We cannot replace these precious lives. But we can replace those who refuse to protect them.
RepLloydDoggett,While Abbott Trump and cohorts are celebrating the gun lobby on Friday too many families will be mourning their loved ones.
