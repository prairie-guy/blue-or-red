RepMcEachin,For far too long the heroism of Black servicemembers has been inadequately celebrated. Not only does this recommendation celebrate Lt. Gen. Gregg &amp; Lt. Col. Adams but it pays homage to the incredible bravery men and women of color have shown serving our nation for generations.
RepMcEachin,Since Fort Lee was shortlisted as one of the first military bases to be renamed I advocated for it to be rededicated in honor of Lt. Gen. Gregg. He embodies the ideals of our nation’s Armed Forces &amp; demonstrated an unrelenting commitment to our country.
RepMcEachin,After receiving more than 34000 submissions the U.S. Naming Commission has announced its recommendation to rename Fort Lee in my district as Fort Gregg-Adams honoring the heroism of Lt. Gen. Arthur J. Gregg &amp; Lt. Col. Charity Adams. http
