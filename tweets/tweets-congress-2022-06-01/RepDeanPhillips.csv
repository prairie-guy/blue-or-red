RepDeanPhillips,An inspiring piece by ⁦@DrTedJ⁩ as we reflect on what unites us as Americans on Memorial Day. http
RepDeanPhillips,Over 1.3 million Americans have died while serving in our armed forces including my dad Artie. They gave their lives so that we may be free. As we honor them on Memorial Day let’s unite in a spirit worthy of their sacrifices. http
RepDeanPhillips,@user We won’t give up.
RepDeanPhillips,There’s nothing more EVIL than propagating the depraved notion that proponents of gun violence prevention want or enable massacres. For goodness’ sake.h/t @user http
RepDeanPhillips,A friendly reminder: The Senate is comprised of 48 Democrats 50 Republicans and 2 Independents and it takes 60 votes to move a bill to the President. If anything's going to get done on gun violence or anything for that matter it's only going to get done with bipartisanship.
RepDeanPhillips,We spend $800b on defense and just sent $40b to Ukraine. We have the resources to begin securing public schools over summer vacation AND agree to common sense policies to stop deranged people from acquiring weapons of mass human destruction by the time school resumes this fall.
RepDeanPhillips,Never imagined I’d become a Yankees fan. http
RepDeanPhillips,May we convert it to a solutions generator. http
RepDeanPhillips,We stare at photos of the smiling children hours before their horrifying murders.We stare at photos of the depraved monsters who commit the massacres.Maybe it’s time we stare at images of the grisly aftermath - just as 1000s of students have had to do.Maybe then we’ll act.
RepDeanPhillips,We all know there are 1000s of aggrieved young men in possession of legally obtained AR-style rifles ammunition and body armor - and ready to snap. We know the next massacre is probably just days or weeks away. So let’s put our heads together and at least try to save lives.
RepDeanPhillips,On the 2nd anniversary of George Floyd’s murder the day after a slaughter of children and teachers in school and a week after the massacre of shoppers in a grocery store let’s call on our better angels and address America’s ills with empathy decency and justice for all.
