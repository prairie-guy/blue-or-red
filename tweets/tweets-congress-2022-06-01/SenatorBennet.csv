SenatorBennet,Every #PrideMonth is an opportunity for us to celebrate the historic steps we have taken toward equality for the LGBTQ community. But as LGBTQ Americans continue to face discrimination and violence we cannot ignore that there is more work to do.We must pass the #EqualityAct.
SenatorBennet,Mark your üóìÔ∏è!On June 7 I will chair the first hearing the Subcommittee on Conservation Climate Forestry and Natural Resources has had since 2013. I look forward to joining Ranking Member @user to discuss solutions to drought affecting our farmlands and forests.
SenatorBennet,Thank you to the men and women in uniform who year after year put their health and safety at risk to serve our country. #MilitaryAppreciationMonth
SenatorBennet,31 people at Amache died in service to this country‚Äîthe same country that incarcerated their families. They never gave up on America‚Äîand neither should we. This #MemorialDay we honor their bravery &amp; all of our troops who have sacrificed to allow democracy to endure in America. http
SenatorBennet,ICYMI: @user and I introduced a bill to ensure police officers firefighters &amp; all public safety officers can access their savings without penalties if they retire early.After serving our communities for years this is the least that we can do. https://t.co/pNTpU0LqDm
SenatorBennet,Yesterday I joined @user and @user to honor Coloradans who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. We can never forget the price our troops pay. #MemorialDay http
SenatorBennet,I cannot understand why the Biden Administration is continuing its harmful investigation into solar tariffs.You can‚Äôt say we want to rapidly deploy clean energy and then stick a dagger in American solar.For Colorado's solar industry @user must end this investigation. http
SenatorBennet,There‚Äôs no other country for which immigration is so central to its identity. People aren‚Äôt lining up to go to Russia or China. They want to come to America. That should fill us with pride. We can build an immigration system that honors our heritage AND upholds the rule of law.
SenatorBennet,Colorado is on the frontlines of climate change and @user leads the way on research and development to help us address it.They will use the $1M in funding we secured to increase soil carbon storage reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help us meet our climate goals. http
SenatorBennet,Honored to attend today's ribbon cutting for the new @user outpatient clinic in Northern Colorado.From mental health to radiology physical therapy and dentistry services this clinic is a one-stop shop for the kind of high-quality care our veterans earned. http
SenatorBennet,We secured $1.5M to help @user establish a first of its kind child care and family services center.Not only will this expand access to child care and other family services in Larimer County ‚Äî something that the community desperately needs ‚Äî it will also create 15-20 jobs. http
SenatorBennet,During the @user hearing this week I pressed @user about the urgent need to address farm labor needs and pass meaningful immigration reform to support our farmers and farmworkers.  I appreciate his support as I work on a bipartisan solution with @user http
SenatorBennet,As our country faces a housing crisis we have to boost the supply of affordable housing.I led a bipartisan group of lawmakers with @user to call on @user &amp; @user to swiftly finalize a new rule to expand affordable housing: http
SenatorBennet,It's absurd that my Republican colleagues won‚Äôt allow us to debate this bill.  This is common-sense legislation to protect our communities from domestic terrorism and future tragedies like the recent massacre in Buffalo.To save our democracy we need to fix the Senate. http
SenatorBennet,This is a deeply difficult moment for our country.  I encourage any Coloradan who is looking for support to reach out to Colorado Crisis Services.  To share your reflections you‚Äôre also always welcome to contact my office: http http
SenatorBennet,@user actions today take a step forward but there‚Äôs more Congress must do to ensure no one is denied justice or their own life because of what they look like.We can get there if we join together and recommit to justice &amp; equal protection for all. http
SenatorBennet,The murder of George Floyd by police reignited an overdue conversation about equality under the law.What happened to him would've never happened to me ‚Äî and we know why. As a nation we're far from our highest ideals but that's our best reason to keep fighting for change.
SenatorBennet,I‚Äôm delighted that the Senate confirmed Charlotte Sweeney to serve on the U.S. District Court. From Charlotte's impressive credentials to her unwavering commitment to ensuring equality under the law I‚Äôm confident she'll make an outstanding judge for the District of Colorado.
