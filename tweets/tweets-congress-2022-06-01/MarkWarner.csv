MarkWarner,Reading the details of these funerals is heart-wrenching. These children deserved so much more.https://t.co/DbGcVCOH9w
MarkWarner,Happy #PrideMonth Virginia! LGBT folks belong here. It’s incredibly disappointing this month comes during a wave of discriminatory bills in states across the country – I’ll keep fighting for LGBT communities by supporting bills like the Equality Act.
MarkWarner,In case you missed it: after our repeated advocacy USDA stepped in and brought 145 beagles to safety from incredibly inhumane conditions. A federal judge has also hit the offending facility with a restraining order. I’m proud that we were able to improve the lives of these dogs. http
MarkWarner,To that same end I’m particularly glad that this bill invests in expanded health care capacity by authorizing and funding over 30 new VA major medical facilities across the country – including a new outpatient clinic in Hampton Roads.
MarkWarner,It’s one thing to promise this care – it’s another to actually provide it. This bill puts forth funding and resources to help the VA make critical claims processing investments that must happen if the VA is going to be able to meet this new demand.
MarkWarner,This legislation will expand health care eligibility for generations of veterans and broaden certain disease and cancer presumptions for veterans who were exposed to these toxins during their service.
MarkWarner,For too long our men and women in uniform have struggled to receive the care they deserve after being exposed to burn pits and other toxins. The bipartisan agreement on the Honoring Our PACT Act is a significant step. It’s critical that the Senate quickly acts on this bill.
MarkWarner,On the third anniversary of the shooting at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center I’m remembering the lives lost. For them and for the people of Uvalde and Buffalo and all the other communities grieving from gun violence I am pushing for real change policy and action.
MarkWarner,On this Memorial Day we honor the brave men and women who died in defense of this great nation. We can never fully repay these heroes for their sacrifice but we can honor their service by continuing to fight for an America that we can all be proud of.
MarkWarner,I’m proud of the work the Senate is doing on the judiciary. Week after week we’re confirming qualified impartial experienced judges that look like the folks they’ll preside over.
MarkWarner,As #AAPI Heritage Month draws to a close I’m incredibly grateful for my opportunities to spend time with Asian diaspora communities across Virginia. Our diversity is our strength and we owe it to our AAPI communities to root out hate and discrimination. http
MarkWarner,BIG NEWS: Virginia is getting over $6 million for Upward Bound programs which will help increase graduation rates at high schools and colleges. http
MarkWarner,Putin’s unwarranted invasion of Ukraine has only made the global community more united. I commend Finland &amp; Sweden on their efforts to join NATO and now I’m pushing on the Biden admin to expedite their application.
MarkWarner,Today the Senate failed to pass a bill that would give agencies more tools to fight white supremacy and domestic terrorism. What a disgrace.
MarkWarner,If you wanted to use a service that deletes your posts after a certain period of time the platforms couldn’t stop that provided the third-part service meets some basic security thresholds.
MarkWarner,Finally it would allow users to designate trusted third-party services to manage their privacy and account settings if they choose.
MarkWarner,Second it would require these platforms make their services interoperable meaning that if you were a Facebook user and wanted to message someone on Snapchat you could do that.
MarkWarner,First it would require that the largest online platforms make user data portable meaning you could easily download your photos messages etc. and take them with you to a new platform if you want to switch services.
MarkWarner,One of the best ways to improve how social media works for users is to encourage more competition in the space. Yesterday I reintroduced my ACCESS Act with a broad range of bipartisan sponsors. Let me tell you a little more about how it works.
MarkWarner,No more thoughts and prayers. The time is now for action. I’ve introduced legislation in the past to institute measures like universal background checks and I’m ready to work with anyone – Republicans or Democrats – to prevent another tragedy.
MarkWarner,Protecting life means supporting commonsense gun control. It means capping insulin copays at $35/month. It means voting for funding for COVID vaccines. It means not criminalizing abortion when the mother’s life is in danger. This is what I am working towards.
MarkWarner,On the anniversary of George Floyd’s murder I am reminded of all the work that lies ahead to achieve true racial justice in this nation. My thoughts are with his family and with all those affected by acts of hate.
