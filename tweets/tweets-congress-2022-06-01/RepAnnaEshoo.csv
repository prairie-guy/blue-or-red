RepAnnaEshoo,America's heroes are our fallen soldiers. On #MemorialDay we remember the generations of Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our democracy and keep our country as a beacon of freedom and liberty. http
RepAnnaEshoo,As we celebrate these communities it’s important not to forget the challenges they face and the ongoing xenophobia and hate they’ve been subjected to.America must always be a welcoming and safe country and I will continue to stand proudly with my AAPI constituents. #APAHM
RepAnnaEshoo,Every May we recognize #AsianPacificAmericanHeritageMonth by honoring past &amp; present achievements of AAPI communities.CA-18 would not be what it is today without our large &amp; vibrant AAPI communities whose participation in every sector strengthens our region in countless ways.
RepAnnaEshoo,No other nation endures such devastating death tolls from gun violence because no other nation is so controlled by the gun lobby. It's past time for the Senate to pass the commonsense gun safety legislation we already passed in the House. Enough is enough.
RepAnnaEshoo,Today as we mourn the 19 little angels and the two educators killed in Texas we mark one year since the deadliest mass shooting in the Bay Area when nine lives were taken at the VTA railyard in San Jose. http
RepAnnaEshoo,We lost 19 little angels &amp; 2 beloved educators to one of the largest mass shootings in our country.The most grievous pain is that of a parent burying their child. This can end if the American people insist it does. The gun lobby is not more important than our nation’s children.
