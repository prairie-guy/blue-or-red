ChrisCoons,Pride is love Pride is equality and Pride is diversity. Today and everyday be proud of who you are and all you are. Love is love and I stand proudly as an LGBTQ+ ally. Happy #Pride! http
ChrisCoons,Glad to see @user outline his plan to bring down inflation and address the costs that are hurting working families. Even as we achieve record job growth we have more to do to strengthen our economy so all Delawareans can succeed.https://t.co/V3Ypc4op4Y
ChrisCoons,At the @user this week I had a productive meeting with Mads Nipper the CEO of Ørsted about the company’s investments in Delmarva’s clean energy future. Scaling offshore wind will reduce our reliance on foreign fuels while creating good-paying jobs in Delaware. http
ChrisCoons,@user @user Not even close. #BTSARMY http
ChrisCoons,Nothing can bring George Floyd back and I know the legacy he has inspired will not ease anyone’s grief. His family is in my prayers. Today though I hope there is some comfort that it is in his name that our country—in its highest halls of power—reaches towards progress.
ChrisCoons,@user @user This EO is supported by leading advocates for civil rights and law enforcement. It will keep our communities safe while beginning to bridge some of the gaps that can exist between officers and the communities they serve. It is a step forward in the process of progress.
ChrisCoons,@user .@Potus' Executive Order will increase accountability ban chokeholds restrict no-knock entries and more for federal law enforcement officers – and set a standard for state and local officers to do the same. It will promote safe effective and just policing.
ChrisCoons,Two years to the day after the world watched George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin and reckoned yet again with longstanding racial injustices I went to the @user as President Biden signed some of the most significant policing reforms in years. http
ChrisCoons,We have to do more. We have to make it harder for individuals to get access to weapons who have demonstrated the capacity or the potential to use them to harm themselves or their families. And we have to do more to address gun violence. We cannot become numb to this. http
ChrisCoons,Thanks to @user for highlighting my comments at @user this morning. We cannot become numb to the lives gun violence takes in communities across the country. http
