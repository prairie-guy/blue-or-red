RepSlotkin,This year’s conference should be a great event with government and business leaders at all levels. I’ll be sharing updates throughout this week and can’t wait to get to work.
RepSlotkin,After letters phone calls and hard work @user wound up issuing another 35000 nationwide seasonal visas for the summer months so towns that run on the tourism industry are on solid footing for their high season.
RepSlotkin,That’s why this winter after we heard about potential staffing issues on the island my team &amp; I pressed @user &amp; the Biden administration to issue more seasonal visas so places like Mackinac are fully staffed. http
RepSlotkin,This event simply wouldn’t be possible without the folks who come back year after year to staff the place. The worker shortages of the last two years have been a struggle for our business owners.
RepSlotkin,One of the reasons I’m happy to be back this year is because of the work my team has done to get more seasonal visas for the workers who staff the hotel restaurants &amp; shops across the island.
RepSlotkin,This year is focused on the business community’s evolving civic role in our polarizing political landscape and the Detroit Chamber has brought in a number of senior leaders in sports (think Tom Izzo &amp; Mia Hamm) to talk about the lessons to be learned to strengthen our state.
RepSlotkin,Just caught the ferry to head to this year’s Mackinac Policy Conference. This is a pretty unique annual event that brings together bipartisan elected officials business &amp; community leaders &amp; journalists to talk about Michigan’s most pressing issues.
RepSlotkin,An O for Oxford; a U for Uvalde – though separated by thousands of miles students in Michigan &amp; Texas now share a unique &amp; painful bond known only to few. Just as folks in Oxford did last fall I know those in Uvalde are holding their loved ones close. http
RepSlotkin,We can’t get 10 votes for my safe gun storage bill or even just to ban bump stocks. We cannot continue to do nothing while our kids are afraid to even go to school. We have to act. 10/10
RepSlotkin,These questions are painful because the answers are so bad: we can’t get 10 GOP votes in the U.S. Senate on a bipartisan bill to extend background checks (which are already in place at big box stores) to internet &amp; gun show sales. 9/10
RepSlotkin,I even got a call from a Lansing-area superintendent — who is also a gun owner and an avid hunter — and you could hear the frustration in his voice when he asked why we can’t put some common sense laws in place.  8/10
RepSlotkin,They were aware that efforts to bring the safe storage law to a vote had just failed in the Michigan Senate yesterday and that I have introduced the same legislation at the federal level. 7/10
RepSlotkin,In all my meetings we discussed the status of several federal grants Oxford has applied for &amp; how my team can continue to be helpful as the community heals. I was also struck by the way teachers &amp; students across the district asked me what Congress would do to address this. 6/10
RepSlotkin,Just as our team offered support and resources to Rep. Tony Gonzales I wasn’t at all surprised to hear that the Oxford fire chief had already reached out to his counterpart in Texas and the new Oxford Schools Superintendent did the same with the Uvalde School District. 5/10
RepSlotkin,As you can imagine many in the community felt so raw from the tragedy that unfolded here less than 6 months ago. Some students didn’t show up for school and graduation. Most are coping the only way they can — by pushing forward &amp; by channeling their grief into service. 4/10
RepSlotkin,I also had the honor of being asked to give the commencement address to the @user Class of 2022. Seeing the joy of these incredibly resilient students was a much needed bright spot in what was a very tough day. 3/10
RepSlotkin,As it happens I had already planned to spend yesterday  in Oxford one day after the world watched the horrible shooting in Uvalde. I was in Oxford to visit the high school and leadership and to hear from first responders as well as local elected leaders. 2/10
RepSlotkin,Oxford High School's students are showing more courage right now than many of my colleagues in the U.S. Senate and the Republicans in the Michigan Senate who just blocked debate on safe gun storage bills yesterday. 1/10 http
