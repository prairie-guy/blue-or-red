RepAdamSchiff,Pride is a time to uplift the LGBTQ+ community.To do so we must remember its roots.Because the first Pride wasn’t a celebration – it was a protest led by trans activists like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.We honor them by standing with the LGBTQ+ community. Always.
RepAdamSchiff,I just introduced a bill to suspend the federal gas tax.To deliver savings for the millions of families struggling to get by.We’ll pay for it with a tax on the excess profits of Big Oil companies.It's time they paid their fair share - and you got a break at the pump.
RepAdamSchiff,On Memorial Day we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice in service of their country.Our nation is safer and stronger today because of the heroes who serve it in uniform.So to all those who serve and to their families and loved ones: Thank you.
RepAdamSchiff,Many of us got involved in politics because we wanted to leave a better world behind.We still can.But not if we lack courage. Or give in to despair.I’m not giving up.You must not either.
RepAdamSchiff,It has been many years since my wife and I dropped off our kids at elementary school.When we did we felt they would have fun learn and be safe. Just like the parents in Uvalde must have thought.
RepAdamSchiff,Imagine a world where it’s easier to get health care than guns.Where children and their teachers go to school and come home safely.It's not a fantasy. It’s happening. In virtually every country but ours.That world is possible. We can make it so.
RepAdamSchiff,.@GovAbbott @user — Are you still planning to join the NRA conference in Texas this weekend? While parents are burying their children? Is your political future really more important than our kids?Will nothing get you to act?
RepAdamSchiff,Two years ago George Floyd was murdered in an act of police brutality.His killer has been held to account.But true justice has yet to be seen.Justice means an end to discrimination against Black individuals. And an end to brutality. We pray for his family. And press on.
