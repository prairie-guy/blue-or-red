SenJohnKennedy,Pres. Biden’s energy policy is limited to wind solar and wishful thinking. That’s bad for Louisiana jobs and household budgets. http
SenJohnKennedy,The sobering truth about Biden-flation is that it’s shutting down Louisiana small businesses and the job opportunities that they create.https://t.co/8mNpHYVTcr
SenJohnKennedy,Americans have built the world’s largest economy and our oil and gas producers are its backbone.But the Biden admin is slashing drilling leases and piling on regulations. Biden is waging war on American energy and every household that depends on it. http
SenJohnKennedy,Gas prices food costs and electric bills are sky-high but Pres. Biden thinks “the problem is that he isn’t getting enough credit for all the good news.” Either the president doesn’t understand how much Louisianians are suffering or he doesn’t care.https://t.co/Wwje2JgAEV
SenJohnKennedy,This $16 million in FEMA aid will help Lafourche and St. Tammany Parishes pay for the repairs and recovery our communities needed in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida. https://t.co/8DfKFO7EKP
SenJohnKennedy,Long before Putin invaded Ukraine he was making Russia a haven for cybercriminals. If Americans can already sue foreign govts for supporting terrorism why can’t they sue govts that help cyber-predators violate their privacy and steal their data?https://t.co/K9P5UEXxtJ
SenJohnKennedy,On this #MemorialDay we remember the sacrifices of the men and women who gave their lives defending this great nation and its liberties. America is free because she is home to the brave. http
SenJohnKennedy,Congrats to Southeastern on their conference title! Can’t wait to see them in the NCAA tournament!https://t.co/AkvKUyesRM
SenJohnKennedy,Last Memorial Day weekend Louisianians were paying $2.71 for a gallon of gas. Today my state is forking out almost DOUBLE that to hit the road thanks to #Bidenflation. https://t.co/yRAB2L1Nzk http
SenJohnKennedy,Our people need more hurricane protection and $1.3B less debt and today we celebrate both of those successes as the storm barrier is complete. https://t.co/iXz1sT4piB http
SenJohnKennedy,"When Pres. Biden took office Louisiana gas was $2 a gallon. It's $4.15 – $4.25 right now. On day 490 of ""Build Back Better"" Louisianians see that nothing's been built nothing is back and nothing is better. http"
SenJohnKennedy,Hurricanes and flooding have devastated Louisiana. My bill would ensure that Louisianians have quick access to the funds they need to rebuild their small businesses and property.https://t.co/KTFNwlnidD
SenJohnKennedy,“As many as 50000 migrants are waiting in Mexican shelters for a chance to cross the border hoping to run out the clock on Title 42.” If Biden isn’t committed to open borders why is he destroying a key tool we have to secure the border? #BorderCrisis https://t.co/fIO8gHwqtY
SenJohnKennedy,More than 480 days into “Build Back Better” Pres. Biden’s policy failures keep gushing like an open fire hydrant and waterboarding American workers and families. http
