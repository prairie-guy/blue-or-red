RepMTG,Only one day each year we honor military members who died serving our country for ALL of us to be free.An entire #PrideMonth and millions in spending through corporations &amp; our government on LGBTQ sexual identity needs to end.The movements goals were achieved were they not?
RepMTG,The Russian collusion hoax was a coup.Many were involved.Are involved.Still covering it up.To be taken seriously Republicans have to bring justice and gut the government of criminals in order to restore the peoples trust in our institutions bc most have lost faith.
RepMTG,4. we will give you our Democrats including the Biden admin Congressional Dems resister federal employees Hollywood commies trans terrorist teachers woke corporate CEO’s super vaxxers and we will throw in a bonus - George Soros and all his money.We will all be so happy!
RepMTG,3. I have a proposal to Canada to solve this.Give us all your guns since you don’t want them and freedom loving anti-vax Canadians especially your truckers &amp; and those who supported them.And in returnCont’d
RepMTG,2. Some Democrat blue check marks &amp; blueanons are now debating if the US could annex defenseless Canada after my tweet thread bc they love Trudeau’s wokeness &amp; tyrannical dictatorship.Remember they “threatened” to move there after Trump won and disappointed us when they stayed.
RepMTG,Well this started two things.1. Canadians &amp; Dem Twitter accounts don’t know that Canada could be attacked even though it has been a recent concern and prompted an Arctic air defense exercise and more.https://t.co/kWLhv9q2VZ1/4 http http
RepMTG,6. Meanwhile the 3rd term Obama admin steps aside and turns their head to countries like Iran &amp; North Korea working diligently to build their own nuclear arsenals.Sure the “most popular” president in history w/ 81 M votes will keep you safe when they take those scary guns away.
RepMTG,5. Does Trudeau expect America to defend them?Of course and so do the rest of western allied nations. The US taxpayers pay for the defense of many countries that do not deserve our military support for free or at all.
RepMTG,4. A heavily armed population backing up a strong military force is a mighty deterrent to any foreign would be invader.Democrats know this too and they demanded Ukraine’s people be armed with the same guns that cause them to shriek in outrage and they’re rushing to ban here.
RepMTG,3. Canada has an incredibly weak military &amp; now with Trudeau’s gun grab his people are left defenseless not only by a criminal attacker but also defenseless against another country’s military invasion.This is a terrible violation of rights to innocent Canadians by their Gov.
RepMTG,2. Trudeau foolishly completely ignores how taking guns away from his people makes his country weak and vulnerable to being invaded and easily taken over by another stronger country.Like perhaps Russia who is very angry at America right now.
RepMTG,1. Trudeau quickly filled his father’s shoes but in Canada not Cuba.This video emits nauseating weakness.A full on tyrannical gun control speech announcement with leaders in the background still masking bc of covid which they’ve all been heavily vaxxed for. http
RepMTG,I’ve never understood why anyone had any real expectations from the Durham investigation.It’s been years and no one is ever held accountable and no one goes to jail in spite of clear evidence.Unless you’re a regular person you never get off &amp; your taxes pay for all this BS.
RepMTG,Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.Today we honor those who have sacrificed their lives so that we can live our lives freely.#MemorialDay http
RepMTG,This man opened fire into a crowd of people with a gun he illegally owned and the hero that stopped him is a woman who was legally carrying her firearm.No red flag law assault weapons ban or maybe even the police would have stopped him.But a brave citizen gun owner did. http
RepMTG,Two largest forest fires in New Mexico are the fault of the federal government. The federal government causes more problems than it solves problems.And the people pay for it all.It’s insane.https://t.co/BKyFSPd8jw
RepMTG,More unintended consequences that hurt Americans from US Congress intervention.Imagine if we had only encouraged peace instead of funded war. http
RepMTG,Hero! http
RepMTG,Our country is suffering crisis after crisis of human &amp; drug trafficking at our dangerous wide open border debilitating skyrocketing inflation &amp; gas prices high crime &amp; no baby formula and the House Speaker can’t even follow her own rules for her stupid political witch hunt. http
RepMTG,REPEAL the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act. http
RepMTG,Sadly Nikki Goeser’s husband was killed in a gun free zone and they couldn’t defend themselves from a man not a gun intent on killing her husband.Red flag laws won’t stop murders and will only hurt gun owners.End gun free zones and empower people to protect themselves. http
RepMTG,The Uniparty is planning to politicize a tragedy and disarm law-abiding gun owners.Tonight I joined @user to discuss my own experience and why we need to end gun free school zones to protect our kids.https://t.co/tW4g3BTJnq
RepMTG,Here are the #BLM “activists” that rose up as a result of @user and @user funding and committed domestic terrorism all over the city streets of America to the tune of over $2 billion in damage plus many deaths.Is this what you’re proud of @user http http
RepMTG,The baby formula crisis started long before the Abbott recall.Our country is failing and the Biden admin’s government solutions are not solving the crisis.America is like a third world country now incapable of providing food for our babies. http
RepMTG,21. There is no amount of gun control laws that will change this.It's not the gun's fault it's everyone's fault.Until we all come together to bring back values that support strong families &amp; healthy childhoods this won't end but we must protect our kids at school NOW!
RepMTG,"20. feeling hopeless spending hours in solitude daily playing video ""games"" that mentally train them to kill people and likely taking psychiatric drugs or recreational drugs or both is the common deadly recipe for mass murder."
RepMTG,19. School/Mass shooters who experienced childhood trauma lacking a loving stable home being raised in an American Godless culture that hates masculinity demeans men puts girls or trans above boys or turns boys into girls teaches fleshly desires over responsibility/work
RepMTG,18. The left has attacked and eroded our culture leading to a severe disrespect of the role of men fathers and masculinity for decades now.We must no longer allow this.Men are our family leaders protectors and give a good &amp; needed balance to women mothers and children.
RepMTG,17. Fathers grandfathers and safe good god fearing respectful and wise male leaders/role models who invest and raise up masculine caring young men teaching them how to lead work and care for a family is one of the most important critical parts of a boys upbringing.
RepMTG,16. Young developing male teens need to be led by good strong and supportive male role models in safe family environments.During puberty they need to be learning how to work socialize as a man involving leadership skills social manners and proper communication skills.
RepMTG,15. An already traumatized or abused young male teen spending large amounts of time alone mentally killing people on line during critical formative years of puberty with high amounts of testosterone naturally occurring in their body is a dangerous factor.For everyone.
RepMTG,"14. But there are other very serious factors we have to widely recognize and discuss.Most if not all of these teenage shooters have spent years in solitude playing video ""games"" killing people on the screen and becoming desensitized to what murdering people really means."
RepMTG,13.  Most school/mass shooters have taken or recently stopped taking medications for mental illness.Taking or going off &amp; on these meds can increase instability and often times exasperate mental health problems instead of helping to solve the underlying emotional crisis.
RepMTG,12. This often leads to prescriptions of medications to treat the damaged mental state of these soon to be shooters.Taking meds like SSRIs have dangerous side effects that can no longer be ignored.Among many other side effects they can cause suicidal and homicidal thoughts.
RepMTG,11. Most school/mass shooters have key things in common.They experienced severe trauma in childhood like parental suicide physical or sexual abuse neglect domestic violence and/or severe bullying.Making them susceptible to depression anxiety thought disorders.
RepMTG,10. School shootings are an evil &amp; horrific sign of severe spiritual sickness in America &amp; the absolute tragic failure to protect our children's bodies hearts &amp; souls.As we mourn &amp; pray for the Uvalde community &amp; families suffering unspeakable loss we must discuss solutions.
RepMTG,9. The only serious solution to protecting our children in schools are spending our hard earned tax dollars on protective solutions that we all know work.Armed guards trained and/or armed teachers and secured points of entry.Protect our kids with good guys with guns.
RepMTG,8. Now while they've spent $53+ BILLION of your tax dollars on their proxy war w/ Russia carelessly grinding the lives of Ukrainian soldiers &amp; civilians in order to achieve regime change and grow globalist power goals Democrats are trying to tell you gun control is the answer.
RepMTG,7. Never forget Democrats supported funded cheered on &amp; participated in violent deadly Antifa/BLM riots all over the country causing $2+ billion in damages in 2020 to achieve their political goals.They are not at all scared of violence.Democrats are the party of violence.
RepMTG,6. Democrats who are demanding gun control made rules that put armed guards in place &amp; force all Members of Congress to go through metal detector and be wanded before we are allowed to enter the House chamber to go vote.Democrats totally believe in armed guards for security.
RepMTG,5. Democrats &amp; our mentally incompetent POTUS Joe Biden are the same people refusing to protect our border from the dangerous all time high daily illegal invasion &amp; are enabling record high human &amp; drug trafficking endangering every American.They don't care about your safety.
RepMTG,4. Joe Biden and the Democrats controlling our country are the same people that brought in 30000 National Guard troops to protect the Capitol from an imaginary MAGA army for months after J6. They spared no expense and sent the bill to the American taxpayer.
RepMTG,3. Democrats know how to protect people and things with guards armed with guns and they support it all the time when it comes to their own safety but not when it comes to our children at school.No they want your children to be innocent sitting ducks in gun free school zones.
RepMTG,2. The left doesn't care about gun violence.Democrat controlled cities and states with the most strict gun control have some of the highest murder rates and most shootings in America.Shooting people is already illegal.Murder is already illegal.Gun control doesn't work.
RepMTG,1. The party of defund the police out of control crime &amp; a deadly open border wants to take away our guns and wants us to trust them with our children's lives while they fund death and war with US tax dollars in some far off land that most Americans can't find on a map.
