RepRaulGrijalva,One week ago 19 children and 2 teachers lost their lives in the worst elementary school shooting since Sandy Hook.Today we honor the victims of gun violence and remember their lives and commit to #EndGunViolence. http
RepRaulGrijalva,Public health is at the center of the environmental and climate justice movements because they are inextricably linked. I applaud the @user EJ Office launch and the Biden administration’s continued all-of-government approach to environmental justice and climate change. http
RepRaulGrijalva,I’m urging @user to intervene before the government of Israel forces over 1000 Palestinians out of their homes in Masafer Yatta. All people including Palestinians deserve to live full lives with freedom and safety. It’s past time US policy reflected that basic truth. http
RepRaulGrijalva,On this #MemorialDay we take this time to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. May we cherish our freedom and never forget its true cost. http
RepRaulGrijalva,Alex Lofgren was a former staffer of mine and veteran who passed away in a tragic accident. This legislation was passed and enacted in his honor to help veterans and their families use our National Parks to help find the same peace and healing our public lands brought Alex.
RepRaulGrijalva,National Parks are now free to access for all veterans &amp; Gold Star families just in time for #MemorialDayWeekend.Thanks to the Alexander Lofgren Veterans in Parks Act veterans and Gold Star families will have free access to national parks in perpetuity. http
RepRaulGrijalva,We need to end access to military-grade weapons.We need universal background checks.We need gun reform now. The House passed the Bipartisan Background Check Act and the Enhanced Background Check Act a year ago.When will the Senate act?
RepRaulGrijalva,In November we have an opportunity to elect leaders that are truly pro-life to pass common sense gun safety legislation to protect our kids. We must stand together and demand action from elected officials to protect our communities and vote out those who stand in the way.
RepRaulGrijalva,No parent should be afraid to drop their child off at school. No kid should have to learn in fear. Current Senate policy on gun reform to do nothing &amp; expect different results is the definition of insanity. The House did its job &amp; passed gun reform. The Senate must act.
