RepAndyLevin,CEOs have been bragging to their shareholders how the rise in inflation the pandemic and the war in Ukraine has given them an excuse to raise prices. Earlier this month the House took a long overdue action to hold them accountable.
RepAndyLevin,This is an illuminating report on how the Big Lie has morphed into sustained threats on those who carry out our elections. In the face of growing harassment and surveillance the federal government must do all it can to support election workers. http
RepAndyLevin,One of the first official acts I took after I was sworn in on January 3 2019 was to become a member of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force because I want to be an active part of the solution to address the scourge of gun violence that our communities and our country faces.
RepAndyLevin,We must continue fighting for a world where Black and Brown folks do not have to worry about being hurt or killed as they grocery shop jog down the street or sleep in their homes. (2/2)

RepAndyLevin,I pledge to support our troops and do my best to keep them out of harm‚Äôs way unless it‚Äôs truly necessary to protect our shores or our nation‚Äôs vital interests.

RepAndyLevin,Last week the House passed critical legislation to help lower prices at the gas pump and stop Big Oil from taking advantage of hardworking Americans by:‚úÖ Ending price gouging‚úÖ Penalizing market manipulators‚úÖ Increasing transparency and accountability
RepAndyLevin,Black college students on average owe $25000 more in student loan debt than white students. Cancelling student debt is a racial justice issue. #CancelStudentDebt
RepAndyLevin,Gun violence not only takes innocent lives but also traumatizes communities forever. See Newton Parkland Orlando Oxford Buffalo and now Uvalde just to name a few. We cannot keep accepting this way of life. #EndGunViolence
RepAndyLevin,Comprehensive background checks. Safe storage. Red flag laws. Ban AR15s. NOW.
RepAndyLevin,Protecting our nation from the scourge of gun violence will require bold action. Without a doubt the Senate must #AbolishTheFilibuster and at long last deliver commonsense gun safety laws for our country.
RepAndyLevin,I joined @user and 81 colleagues in calling on @user and @user to engage with the Israeli government to prevent the inhumane eviction of 1000 Palestinians from their homes. These evictions will push peace and a two-state solution further out of reach. http
RepAndyLevin,Call me radical but it‚Äôs unacceptable that millions of Americans lost their health insurance during a global pandemic due to being laid off from their jobs. We need #MedicareForAll.
RepAndyLevin,I had at a wonderful time joining lunchtime at the Clawson Senior Center. We discussed Social Security why we need to be able to negotiate for prescription drugs our gun violence public health emergency and what more we can do for our communities. http
RepAndyLevin,Two years after George Floyd‚Äôs death the pain is still palpable. I‚Äôm thinking of his daughter Gianna and her words ‚Äúmy daddy changed the world.‚Äù Police brutality is a stain on the moral fabric of this nation. The Senate must pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
RepAndyLevin,We need you and all the talent and ideas you bring to the table; you belong! If you are struggling there are people who care and resources available to help. @user
RepAndyLevin,As #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth comes to an end I‚Äôm thinking of all the LGBTQIA+ kids across the country as their human rights are increasingly under attack in state legislatures. To the young queer trans and nonbinary young people out there ‚Äì I love you just as you are. (1/2) http
RepAndyLevin,May is #JewishAmericanHeritageMonth‚Äîa time to celebrate Jewish culture and the many contributions of the Jewish people to the fabric of American society. And what it means to me to have a mezuzah on my doorpost is that the sense of spirituality of Judaism infuses this place. http
RepAndyLevin,I joined @user and @user in calling for a U.S.-led investigation into Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh‚Äôs death. New evidence unearthed by @user makes this investigation even more urgent. http
RepAndyLevin,Democracy must be protected‚Äîat home and abroad. I proudly signed onto @user and @user letter calling for free and fair elections in Colombia. http
RepAndyLevin,I hear stories from constituents all the time about the devastating consequences of exorbitant prescription drug prices. No person should have to choose between medicine and putting food on the table. We need to lower costs NOW.
RepAndyLevin,I also proudly voted to pass H.R. 3 the Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act. This bill stops drug companies from ripping off Americans while charging other countries less for the same drugs.
RepAndyLevin,One of the first bills I introduced when I got to Washington was one to bring down drug prices: the STOP GAMES Act. This bipartisan bill would prevent pharmaceutical companies from gaming the FDA approval process to block generic competition.
RepAndyLevin,Drug makers are raising prices to pad their profits. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve made taking on Big Pharma one of my biggest priorities as a member of Congress. üßµ
RepAndyLevin,Three months after Russia's unjust invasion of Ukraine @user and @user are finally leaving Russia. I've called on all responsible companies to #StopProfitsForPutin and withdraw from Russian markets to ensure Putin can't wage war in Ukraine. http
RepAndyLevin,Parents should not be afraid to send their children to school. Folks should not be afraid to go to the grocery store. It does not have to be this way.
RepAndyLevin,No person seeking an abortion should fear for their safety. We must continue to stand with abortion providers and patients and uplift the leaders working day-in and day-out to protect this human right. I am proud to stand with our Governor. #LiberateAbortion
RepAndyLevin,I applaud @user Executive Directive which takes decisive action to ensure the MI government does not aid in the persecution of women and people from out of state seeking abortions. It also seeks to expand access to reproductive health care. http
RepAndyLevin,I‚Äôve hardly processed the Uvalde shooting. As a dad of four my heart is shattered. As a longtime gun reform advocate I am angry. As a member of Congress on the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force I am ready for action. I don‚Äôt want to hear any more talk‚Äîwe need to act.
RepAndyLevin,How many children have to die before we #AbolishTheFilibuster and pass sensible gun reform? How much mass death does our country have to witness before Republicans choose to act?
RepAndyLevin,Two years ago today George Floyd was murdered by police. Today we continue to witness the scourge of police violence as it claims more Black lives. We must end qualified immunity pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and meaningfully remedy the wrongs of our past.
RepAndyLevin,Save the thoughts and prayers and bring on actual action and commonsense gun reform. That‚Äôs what our country needs so we never again have to say ‚Äúnever again.‚Äù
RepAndyLevin,This is absolutely heinous‚Äîespecially in the wake of yet another school shooting. Safe storage is a commonsense reform that a vast majority of Americans support. http
