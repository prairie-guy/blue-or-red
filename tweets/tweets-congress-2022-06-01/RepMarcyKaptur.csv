RepMarcyKaptur,KIDS ARE DYING.Enough is enough.The Senate needs to act without delay.
RepMarcyKaptur,Americans are pleading for change.The House has acted.But those in the Senate who are holding up COMMON SENSE bills need to find the courage they have been unable or unwilling to muster so far.
RepMarcyKaptur,There are actions we can take - through up or down votes - that will stem the incomprehensible carnage we are seeing all across this country.
RepMarcyKaptur,Teachers shouldn’t have to be armed.Schools shouldn’t have to be turned into fortresses.And parents shouldn’t have to wonder in the back of their minds if they are seeing their kids for the very last time when they head to school.
