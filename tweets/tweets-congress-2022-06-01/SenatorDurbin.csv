SenatorDurbin,Vladimir Kara-Murza is a fearless Russian patriot and leader for democracy. By passing this resolution we honor his work and call for his immediate release along with Alexei Navalny and so many other Russian political prisoners. http
SenatorDurbin,Today I visited @user to announce $2 million in new federal funding @user and I secured for SIU to help build a workforce that meets our evolving needs and provide quality health care to our rural communities. http
SenatorDurbin,By passing this bipartisan resolution the Senate is sending a clear message to our Baltic friends: we stand with you in upholding democratic values abroad. And we will support you as you defend against Russian aggression. http
SenatorDurbin,This Memorial Day we honor and remember the brave men and women who gave their lives in service to our nation. We must never forget their courage honor and sacrifice. http
SenatorDurbin,As we mourn those lost in the tragic school shooting in Uvalde we face the reality that gun violence has now become the leading cause of death for American children &amp; teens. Let that sink in.@JudiciaryDems will hold a hearing on June 15 focused on gun violence and kids. http
SenatorDurbin,Today I joined a group of doctors &amp; young leaders at @user to discuss the epidemic of gun violence &amp; the toll this trauma has on our youth. Whether in Uvalde or Chicago these shootings are a public health crisis. Congress must act on sensible investments &amp; reforms. http
SenatorDurbin,The insensitivity and deception of the FBI agents in this matter may not have been criminally actionable but it was morally unforgivable. @user will continue its oversight and legislative work in an effort to prevent such abuses in the future. http
SenatorDurbin,Kissinger once again shows his twisted view of the world by calling on Ukraine to spare Putin the embarrassment of defeat. As Ukrainians fight and die Kissinger worries about Putin’s feelings. I worry about the Ukrainian people who have paid for their nation in blood. http
SenatorDurbin,Democrats have yet again issued a good faith invitation to Republicans to join us in a conversation about common sense gun safety reforms. I hope they will accept it.If Uvalde isn't the tipping point then what is? It’s time for us to finally do something to make America safer. http
SenatorDurbin,I'm on the Senate floor urging Senators to support my Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act. #DTPAWatch live: http
SenatorDurbin,Buffalo. El Paso. Poway. Pittsburgh. On and on. In every corner of our nation communities are bonded in the trauma and devastation that follows violent acts of white supremacist terrorism. It's time we finally take action with the urgency these victims deserve and pass my #DTPA. http
SenatorDurbin,I’m grateful to the President for working with both the civil rights community and law enforcement to craft this measure. However a set of policies will not erase generations of systemic racism. We all must continue to actively work to build a more just and equitable America.
SenatorDurbin,The House did its job in 2020 and passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Unsurprisingly Senate Republicans refused to join Democrats to pass meaningful police reform legislation. So today President Biden took action and signed this important Executive Order.
SenatorDurbin,Two years ago George Floyd died on the streets of Minneapolis with the knee of a police officer on his neck—an image that haunts me to this day. The injustice of his killing is undeniable. And so is the fact that systemic racism continues to plague America. http
SenatorDurbin,I am once again live on the Senate floor calling—begging—for my Republican colleagues to wake up and help Democrats do something about the scourge of gun violence in this nation. Watch: http
SenatorDurbin,Straw-purchased guns are involved in the deaths of far too many Americans—including the murder of CPD Officer Ella French. Once confirmed I look forward to working closely with Steven Dettelbach and @user to crack down on the straw purchasing of firearms across the country. http
