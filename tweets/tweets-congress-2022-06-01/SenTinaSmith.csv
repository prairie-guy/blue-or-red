SenTinaSmith,Thanks @user for hosting me today to talk about their nursing simulation lab which I helped get funding for in the Senate. It was great meeting everyone. http
SenTinaSmith,Itâ€™s great to see that we are creating programs to help Ukrainian refugees but other refugees such as our Afghan allies are subject to far more restrictive policies. The U.S. should adopt a fair and consistent approach for all humanitarian protections. http
SenTinaSmith,This is a step in the right direction and I am glad to see this bill introduced in the Senate. Thanks @user for working with me on this.
SenTinaSmith,Mental health care is health care and they should not be treated as two separate issues. My bill would work to integrate mental health care into primary care practices.
SenTinaSmith,Some news. I have been working on a bipartisan bill to increase access to mental health care across the country. It was introduced in the Senate this week.
