RepRoybalAllard,There is no one solution to stop gun violence. There are many:üîêrequiring safe storage of firearms‚òéÔ∏èmaking gun owners report lost or stolen firearms within 48 hoursüö´keeping guns from high-risk individualsüóÉÔ∏èrequiring background checks for gun shows &amp; online marketplaces
RepRoybalAllard,I know more Americans need access to affordable mental health care.But that alone won‚Äôt end gun violence. We must prioritize keeping guns out of the hands of high-risk people outlaw gun trafficking require gun owners to report lost/stolen firearms &amp; enhance background checks.
RepRoybalAllard,Gun violence is the leading cause of death among children. In 2020 4357 children were shot and killed.  This is unacceptable. It will never be normal. We have a duty to act NOW.https://t.co/GRyZVxtXly
