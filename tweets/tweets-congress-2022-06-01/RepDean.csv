RepDean,While I support reinstating the Federal Assault Weapons Ban we do not have the support in a 50/50 Senate.And we need to make change now.That's why I support both @RepAnthonyBrown's and @SenFeinstein's bills to raise the purchase age to 21.
RepDean,Across our entire nation it is illegal for 18-year-olds to buy beer and cigarettes.Yet in some states they can buy an AR-15.Where is the logic?Congress must federally raise the age to purchase *all* firearms to 21.
RepDean,@user We passed enhanced universal background checks out the House months ago. We will be voting on a red flags bill in the coming weeks. Thank you for your question.
RepDean,Our nation is suffering from a gun epidemic and mental health crisis.Time and again our children bear the worst of it.It is unconscionable.Congress must act — and every damn member must have the courage to act.Let’s take action on mental health AND gun regulation.
RepDean,67% of gun owners support red flags laws.Lawmakers have no excuse to not get a red flag bill to @user desk.No one's constituents want to live like this.We must take action and do our jobs. http
RepDean,We all want more regulations to protect our families.Congress must pass:@RepLucyMcBath's red flag bill to prohibit a person who poses a risk to themselves or others from buying a gunAnd @RepAnthonyBrown's Raise the Age Act to raise the purchase age of a semiautomatic to 21.
