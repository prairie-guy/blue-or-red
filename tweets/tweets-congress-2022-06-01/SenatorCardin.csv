SenatorCardin,There is no reason on Earth why an 18-year-old needed to buy two assault weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition within a few days. None. These weapons are designed and manufactured for war – to kill people. There is no legitimate sporting purpose for owning such a weapon.

SenatorCardin,This report raises questions of apparent ethics violations over many years undermining the integrity of promotions for diplomats at the @user These concerns make it more urgent for Congress to swiftly pass my and @user bipartisan legislation. http
SenatorCardin,In addition to passing reasonable gun safety laws the Senate must confirm Steve Dettelbach as the next Director of ATF. ATF is responsible for enforcing our nation’s gun laws but has not had a Senate-confirmed director for 7+ years. http
