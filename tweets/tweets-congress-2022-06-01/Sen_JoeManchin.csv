Sen_JoeManchin,WATCH: Every June we celebrate Great Outdoors Month. I encourage every West Virginian to get outside with friends and family this month to enjoy and celebrate the wild and wonderful outdoor playground we have been blessed with. @user http
Sen_JoeManchin,By allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices capping the cost of insulin at $35 per month and allowing the importation of drugs from Canada we can lower prescription drug prices in America. We must take action &amp; keep the promises we've made to our seniors.
Sen_JoeManchin,West Virginia's seniors helped build this nation and I'm committed to ensuring they have the quality of life they deserve. That's why I joined @user today to stand up for #WV seniors &amp; call on my colleagues to support legislation to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. http
Sen_JoeManchin,This morning I rode to the #WV Veterans Memorial to pay respects to West Virginians who have given the ultimate sacrifice for the cause of freedom. Thank you to the young men &amp; women of the @user Charleston Composite Squadron for standing guard over the memorial today. http
Sen_JoeManchin,Today we honor and remember those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. Today please join me in praying for our Gold Star Families. Thank you to all of those who have served our country &amp; defended the freedoms we enjoy as Americans. #MemorialDay
Sen_JoeManchin,WATCH: This week I hosted a tele-town hall for Veterans who are concerned that they will lose the healthcare services they know &amp; love at #WV's VA Medical Centers. I will not let the VA's proposed cuts to #WV Veterans' services happen on my watch. http
Sen_JoeManchin,I have heard from many West Virginia Veterans about the VA's recommendations to the AIR Commission and one thing is clear: they do NOT want their VA facilities to be closed. I will continue to fight for our Veterans &amp; protect their healthcare.  http
Sen_JoeManchin,Last year more than 107000 Americans and 1490 West Virginians died from drug related overdoses. Today I introduced the bipartisan EFFECTIVE Act with @user to help keep redundant more harmful opioids off the market. http
