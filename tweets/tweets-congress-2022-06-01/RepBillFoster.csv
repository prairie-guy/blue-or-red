RepBillFoster,Making sure our communities have the resources they need to support first responders is critical. That's why I'm proud to advocate for federal funding to equip Aurora with next-generation technologies and capabilities to keep our communities safe. http
RepBillFoster,Can't wait to read these. Hearing from young people from our communities is one of the best parts of this job. http

RepBillFoster,I can't think of projects any more important than enhancing public safety and upgrading our infrastructure.I'll always fight to make sure IL-11 communities like Aurora get their fair share of federal resources. http
RepBillFoster,Weapons of war have no place in our communities. It's time to reinstate the Assault Weapons Ban.
RepBillFoster,Since 2020 gun violence is the leading cause of death among children and teenagers. When car crashes were the leading cause of death to children we changed the laws. We made cars and driving safer. Now it’s time to act on #gunviolenceprevention.
