RepNikema,Today is the beginning of #PrideMonth! This is a time for celebration and for honoring folks who have dedicated themselves to fighting for justice equality and community. We need to all be #OutLoudOnPurpose in support of our LGBTQ+ neighbors this month and every month. http
RepNikema,They can start by passing legislation that I and my House colleagues have already voted to send them: ▪️ The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act (H.R. 350)▪️ The Bipartisan Background Checks Act (H.R. 8)▪️ The Enhanced Background Checks Act (H.R. 1446)It's time to act!
RepNikema,It has been less than three weeks since ten Black people were killed in the white supremacist attack in Buffalo. We CANNOT let that horrific day be forgotten and the Senate needs to take action to deal with the threats of white supremacy and gun violence.
RepNikema,While we're on the topic of paying for college I have something to add: Education is the great equalizer and NO student should miss out on it because of its cost. We need to make college more affordable AND help folks who are held back by the crippling costs of student debt. http
RepNikema,Hey parents and students! Don't forget that the deadline to submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is in less than a month. June 30th is coming up so make sure to get the application submitted.Access the online FAFSA form here: http
RepNikema,101 years ago a violent white mob attacked the thriving Black community in the Greenwood District of Tulsa. The racist mob massacred Black families and destroyed the community known as Black Wall Street.Today too many people have still not been taught about that history. http
RepNikema,As we reach the end of #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth remember that mental health services are critical for young people. I've announced that @user is receiving $200000 to improve services across GA and I am so thankful for GSU and others who are doing that critical work.
RepNikema,Today on #MemorialDay we honor those who lost their lives in service of our country and of its ideals. Servicemembers of every race religion origin and creed have made the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of a more just country for ALL. http
RepNikema,It was a big week in the Fighting Fifth. Thanks to everyone who showed up and showed out at a week full of celebrations great events and awards back home! #NikemasNotes http
RepNikema,Congratulations to @user professor Deborah Lipstadt on being sworn in as the U.S.'s Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism. The Fighting Fifth leads the way on standing up to injustice and building a world where ALL are welcome. Thank you Ambassador! http
RepNikema,Senate Republicans just blocked the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act which finally takes white supremacy seriously as the terrorist threat that it is. I just have one question: when will enough be enough? How many innocent people will die before you decide to act?
RepNikema,"Make no mistake: this ban is shameless it is cruel and it will ruin lives.I spent a decade working for Planned Parenthood and I know that there is NOTHING ""pro-life"" about draconian efforts to eliminate equal access to legal safe abortion care. http"
RepNikema,Grocery stores are not war zones. Schools are not war zones.So why is it so easy to buy weapons of war? Time and time again we've seen assault weapons used to take innocent lives and commit heinous acts of violence. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. It's time to pass the Assault Weapons Ban.
RepNikema,As the mom of an elementary school student I refuse to accept a country where children face a gun violence epidemic every day. We need sweeping gun violence prevention legislation to end this violence and stand up for America's children. It's time to act to #StopGunViolence. http
