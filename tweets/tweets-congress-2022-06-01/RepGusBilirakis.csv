RepGusBilirakis,Sadly if we continue to have one party rule in Washington the majority of small business owners who fear the economy will continue to worsen over the next year are probably right.  http
RepGusBilirakis,Just two years ago the price of a gallon of gas was under $2.00. Today it is at a record high of $4.59.  Easing pain at the pump is simple:  Restore Domestic Production! http
RepGusBilirakis,I enjoyed participating in the  New Port Richey Knights of Columbus’s first annual Vietnam War Veterans BBQ.  Sadly too many Veterans who served in Vietnam did not receive the warm welcome they deserved.  It is wonderful to see their service and sacrifice being honored. http
RepGusBilirakis,It is time to defund the World Health Organization (WHO).  It is clear this failed bureaucratic international institution is not working in the interests of the American people http
RepGusBilirakis,The greatest country in the world should never be dependent on any other country to meet its energy needs.  We need to flip the switch and restore energy independence by boosting domestic production.  http
RepGusBilirakis,It is time to ease pain at the pump by regaining American Energy Independence and restoring domestic production! http
RepGusBilirakis,On this Memorial Day and always may we honor the memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our country.  We owe them and their families a debt of gratitude that can never fully be repaid. #NeverForgotten http
RepGusBilirakis,There were 234088 illegal crossings at our southern border in April—the worst month on record. What will it take for the Biden Administration to uphold our laws and secure the border? #BidenBorderCrisis http
RepGusBilirakis,Sadly this has become the norm in President Biden’s America. http
RepGusBilirakis,ICYMI- A bill I’ve co-authored the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act 2.0 is one step closer to passing.  It will expand research to develop more effective treatments for childhood cancer.  http
RepGusBilirakis,I was disheartened when 217 Democrats blocked consideration of the Communities Deserve Cops Act last week.  Police departments across the country are struggling to recruit new officers to fill 46k open positions. We need to be doing all we can to help support law enforcement. http
RepGusBilirakis,This is further proof that Big Tech cannot be trusted to police itself and protect the rights of its users! http
RepGusBilirakis,I'm humbled to honor Ben Ferencz who has spent more than 50 years prosecuting war crimes and genocide.  Our brightest moments as an international community have been ones in which we present a united front to and identify and eradicate evil.  http
RepGusBilirakis,Record-high inflation coupled with workforce shortages and supply chain disruptions have hurt all Americans and have been catastrophic for small businesses with every sector of our economy impacted.  Democrats can’t keep ignoring this problem. https://t.co/6I2S0l0XY2
RepGusBilirakis,Today I participated in a hearing on the formula shortage.  Instead of throwing more money at the problem which won't solve anything I am focused on real solutions!  I'm proud to co-sponsor the Babies Need More Formula Now Act! http
RepGusBilirakis,Glad to see the Administration coming to its senses and shutting down the ill-conceived Disinformation Board.  Americans want @user focused on protecting our country &amp; enforcing our laws-not censoring the speech and online conduct of American citizens. http
