RepMarieNewman,Earlier this year I wrote an op-ed outlining how the lack of federal action leaves states like Illinois vulnerable to illegal gun trafficking.Without universal background checks local laws are only as good as our neighboring states'.We MUST act now.https://t.co/9wagOqIM4E
RepMarieNewman,Do you know what the leading cause of death is among children in America? Guns.You read that right. If you have a child in America they are more likely to die from a gun than any other cause.It is damn well past time to bring #GunViolencePrevention bills to the Senate floor. http
RepMarieNewman,.@GovAbbott doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about.The MAJORITY of illegal firearms recovered in Chicago come from out-of-state dealers in red states like Indiana or Wisconsin.Without universal background checks our gun laws are only as good as our neighboring states. http
