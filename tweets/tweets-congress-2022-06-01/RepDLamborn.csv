RepDLamborn,On this Memorial Day I ask that you join me in praying for the fallen and their families that they may find peace in God's embrace. And we resolve that every time the flag unfurls it will fly over a strong and grateful nation. http
RepDLamborn,Today is a solemn day of commemoration. It's the day when we remember and honor the men and women in uniform who laid down their lives in service to our country. These American heroes paid the ultimate price so that we may enjoy the ultimate gift: freedom.
