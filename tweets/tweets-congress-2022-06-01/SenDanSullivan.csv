SenDanSullivan,I want to thank everyone who turned out yesterday for the moving #MemorialDay ceremony at the Mat-Su Veterans Wall of Honor in Wasilla. http
SenDanSullivan,One of the most satisfying things that I’ve seen while serving as Alaska’s U.S. senator is how much our communities all over the state support our military and our veterans. #MemorialDay http
SenDanSullivan,Today all across our great state all across our great nation communities will gather to pay homage to those who gave their all in defense of our nation. I hope you have a wonderful meaningful #MemorialDay. http
SenDanSullivan,As @user chair it was an honor to present Alexey Navalny the John S. McCain Freedom Award. Persecuted poisoned &amp; now in a Russian jail cell he is proof the call for justice &amp; democracy cannot be silenced. Thank you @user for your strength &amp; courage. #standwithnavalny http
SenDanSullivan,Don't miss a very special #AlaskanoftheWeek on the Senate floor beginning around 3:45pm EDT / 11:45am AKT.Watch live:https://t.co/Smyq8mgDlg http
SenDanSullivan,In that regard I believe our nation is in the initial stages of a severe mental health crisis manifesting in the worst ways imaginable especially among our youth. The causes are multifaceted and I am deeply committed to understanding and addressing this crisis.
SenDanSullivan,Julie and I are horrified by the events that occurred yesterday in Uvalde Texas. At the heart of these evil acts is a sickness threatening our nation. The common theme of almost all of these mass shootings is the social alienation of sick young men often fueled by social media.
