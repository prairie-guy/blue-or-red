RepMikeQuigley,Over 18000 people will die from a brain tumor this year alone. We need a breakthrough. That's why I have introduced a bipartisan resolution to designate May as National Brain Tumor Awareness Month in order to propel brain tumor research and treatments forward.
RepMikeQuigley,One week ago our nation lost 19 children and 2 teachers in a shooting in Uvalde Texas. I am committed to ending the violence and fear that looms over our schools.In order to do this we must ban assault weapons and implement universal background checks NOW. http
RepMikeQuigley,Nothing could make it more clear that we need to ban assault weapons than knowing that even the police are afraid to confront a gunman carrying an AR-14.We must pass the Assault Weapons Ban.https://t.co/MxAP8sxiUG
RepMikeQuigley,On #MemorialDay we honor servicemembers from all walks of life who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.Sharing their stories and experiences will help us tell a more complete story of our country and those who have fought to defend it.
RepMikeQuigley,Gun violence is now the leading cause of death among children and teenagers.When car crashes were the leading cause of death for children we passed laws to save lives and made cars and driving safer.What will it take for Republicans to do the same for gun violence?
RepMikeQuigley,As positivity rates rise it's important to be protected against COVID-19. Luckily the FDA has now authorized the booster for children ages 5-11.
RepMikeQuigley,Today would be a great day for Republicans to vote to pass universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons. Actions speak louder than thoughts and prayers. It's time to do the right thing.
RepMikeQuigley,The Women's Health Protection Act may have failed in the Senate but Democrats aren't giving up. We will fight for reproductive rights harder than ever before. Republicans don't deserve to take away a women's right to decide when to start a family.
RepMikeQuigley,It's hard to fathom the damage done to a bodyâ€”let alone the body of a childâ€”when shot with an AR-15.We have the power to make sure this never happens again. We must ban assault weapons and strengthen federal gun laws. If we don't Republicans will have blood on their hands.
RepMikeQuigley,The first Operation Fly Formula flight landed in Indiana Monday with more than 70000 pounds of specialty formula. Typically the process to transport this product from Europe to the U.S. would take 2 weeks. Thanks to Operation Fly Formula @user cut that down to about 3 days.
RepMikeQuigley,Gov. Abbott is trying to use our city to justify doing nothing about gun violence. The fact is there are more gun deaths in Texas than in Illinois because where there are lax gun laws there are more gun deaths. The more @user denies the truth the more children are in danger. http
RepMikeQuigley,Lax enforcement of the gun laws already on our books has let some of the nationâ€™s most notorious gun sellers off the hook turning a blind eye to business practices that contribute to flooding the streets with guns that are then used in crime. http

RepMikeQuigley,I am relieved that this reporter and her crew are safe but this is absolutely disgusting behavior. No one should be waving a gun around while walking down the street and no journalist should feel threatened when they go out to report on what is happening in our city. http
RepMikeQuigley,Republicans say gun control measures don't workâ€”they're lying.Nearly every other developed country has proven that strict gun laws stop these mass shootings and keep people safe.We need universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons NOW. http
RepMikeQuigley,More than 60% of guns confiscated by Chicago police are purchased in states with lax gun laws.Don't use the tragedies we experience in Chicago as an excuse for doing nothing. http
