SenShelby,In honor of the men &amp; women in uniform who have fallen for our freedom each year we remember and pay tribute to their selfless sacrifice. We can never repay them but we should always take the time to recognize their bravery and commitment to this great nation. #MemorialDay2022 http
SenShelby,.@USDOT awarded the Alabama and Tennessee River Railway $5M for a series of improvements between Birmingham and Guntersville. This project will be instrumental in providing safe efficient transportation of goods and services along the railway system and alleviating car traffic.
SenShelby,Today I reviewed the @user and @user FY23 budget request during a defense appropriations subcommittee hearing. The Navy and Marine Corps play a critical role in the defense of our nation. I thank Admiral Gilday and General Berger for their kind words. http http
