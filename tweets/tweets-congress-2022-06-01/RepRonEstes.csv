RepRonEstes,(2/2) While the spirit of these Kansans remains undeterred the assistance provided from this federal disaster declaration will help communities rebuild following the two severe winter storms that impacted 20 counties.
RepRonEstes,Earlier this year our state was hit with harsh winter storms. Yet Kansans are determined resilient and rugged individuals who have been weather-tested for years. Last week a disaster declaration was declared for affected areas. (1/2)
RepRonEstes,Today is a day to honor those who gave their lives in defense of our freedom. Wishing you a safe Memorial Day as we remember our fallen heroes. #MemorialDay http
