RepJerryNadler,This commonsense omnibus gun bill will address many of the loopholes that have allowed these horrific attacks to occur and I plan to get this to the floor for a vote as soon as possible.

RepJerryNadler,This Order will:•direct federal law enforcement agencies to revise use-of-force policies •restrict the use of risky tactics like no-knock warrants &amp; chokeholds. •create a national registry for officers fired for abuse or misconduct And much more.
RepJerryNadler,I was proud to join @user as he signed this Executive Order today. This long-overdue EO comes on the 2nd anniversary of the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. President Biden has made it clear he will not allow the momentum of police reform to fizzle out. http
