SenatorTester,"Mental health is one of the biggest challenges of our time. We've got to do all we can to continue improving both access to mental health care as well as the care itself.If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health call 800-950-6264 or text ""NAMI"" to 741741."
SenatorTester,Support shouldn't be hard to find or afford. That's why I'm working to get Medicare to cover mental health services and why I've worked with both parties to simplify and strengthen the National Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Crisis Hotline.
SenatorTester,We also have to keep in mind the folks who work their tails off caring for us: our health care professionals.These heroes have been put through the wringer these last two years which is why we codified protections for their mental health into law at the end of last year.
SenatorTester,When it comes to caring for our fighting men and women we must remember there are unseen wounds of war.We passed my Hannon Act to bolster VA's mental health workforce and increase rural veterans' access to care and I'm pushing to ensure itâ€™s implemented as Congress intended.
SenatorTester,We can't ignore the mental health crisis happening in rural America.My Seeding Rural Resilience Act and the funding I secured for mobile services were critical first steps but we need to double down by passing my bills to expand tele-mental health services and coverage.
SenatorTester,Mental health is as important as physical health and it's critical to address challenges early.We invested in school mental health services with the American Rescue Plan and I've got a bill to build on these resources and give students the tools they need for the long haul.
SenatorTester,Folks we all struggle or know someone who struggles with mental health. That's why we've got to keep working to ensure everyone has access to the care and services they need.Here are some ways I'm working to expand access to mental health care: ðŸ§µ #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth
SenatorTester,Yesterday my colleagues and I paid our respects to those who died in service to this nation. The fact is we've still got more to do to uphold our promises to the fighting men and women still living.No more empty promises. It's time to pass this bill and pay the cost of war. http
SenatorTester,It was a great privilege to be with veterans local leaders and community members in Laurel today as we honor Montana servicemembers who gave the ultimate sacrifice. These fallen heroes have made this country what it is today and we would not be here without them. http
SenatorTester,On Memorial Day we come together as a nation to recognize the men and women who signed up for service and gave the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms and liberties. While we can never fully repay the debt we owe them let us vow to honor their legacy today and every day. http
SenatorTester,More than 60000 veterans in Montana may have been exposed to toxic substances during their serviceâ€”thatâ€™s nearly two-thirds of all Montana vets.Right now they're the ones paying the cost of war. It's on us to right this wrong and I won't stop fighting until we do.
SenatorTester,Traveling this summer? By investing in the repairs and expansions Montana's airports need we're working to make it safer easier and more affordable to fly in and out of the Treasure State.https://t.co/mvVKTVSaJK
SenatorTester,Getting this toxic exposure bill to the President's desk is the only way to keep our end of the bargain to our all-volunteer military.As we all know freedom is not free. It's time we pay the cost of war.https://t.co/YooKX9wRtz

SenatorTester,I testified in support of my St. Mary's Reinvestment Act yesterday which will build on the resources I secured in my bipartisan infrastructure law.Water is life and the St. Mary's Diversion Dam is essential water infrastructure for communities along Montana's northern tier. http
SenatorTester,Today I called on every one of my colleagues to vote YES on our bipartisan toxic exposure bill when it comes to the floor in June.There is a price to pay when we send folks off to war and right now our veterans are paying it. We can't wait any longer to right this wrong. http
SenatorTester,GOOD NEWS: The Senate took a big step forward and filed cloture on @user and my bipartisan SFC Heath Robinson PACT Actâ€”the most comprehensive toxic exposure package we'll deliver in this country's history.This means we're taking this bill to the floor the week of June 6. http
SenatorTester,Cleaning up and redeveloping contaminated sites is critical for long-term economic growth. Investing in these projects will create jobs lower costs and grow our local economiesâ€”which is exactly what my bipartisan infrastructure law was designed to do.https://t.co/ZSaqIJ5czy
