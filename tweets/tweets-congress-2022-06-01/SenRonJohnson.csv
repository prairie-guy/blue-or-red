SenRonJohnson,Building a stable economic future in America begins with a return to economic sanity. A good place to start: secure the border stop fueling inflation with out of control deficit spending and prioritize free-market competition. Read more here:https://t.co/lIzjkN0cav
SenRonJohnson,Further proof there are separate systems of justice in America – one for liberal Democrats and their elite backers and one for everyone else. Sad. http
SenRonJohnson,Grateful to join the community of Bonduel to celebrate the dedication of a new Veterans Memorial.A wonderful tribute to the bravest among us as we remember our fallen heroes this Memorial Day. http
SenRonJohnson,John sorry to hear you might be experiencing a vaccine injury. As you are finding out you are not alone. Here’s my chart using CDC and FDA data that has repeatedly been censored by media. http http
SenRonJohnson,Today is an opportunity to remember and honor those who paid the ultimate price for our freedom and security. We are the land of the free because of the brave. Thank you for your service and sacrifice. http
SenRonJohnson,.@JayWeber3 thank you for seeing and conveying the truth. http
SenRonJohnson,For a governor who helped incite the Kenosha riots and refuses to fire the Parole Commission chairman after he granted parole for a man who stabbed his wife 42 times in front of their children Tony Evers has no credibility with Wisconsinites and giving advice on public safety. http
SenRonJohnson,I’m pleased my resolution received bipartisan support and the Senate will be able hold another vote to disapprove of President Biden’s lawless power grab.Biden’s admin needs to follow the law not break it further to aid their already out of control immigration system. http
SenRonJohnson,This week I lead my colleagues in a message to @user and the Biden admin: The sovereignty of the United States is not negotiable.Federal and international agencies failed miserably in their response to COVID-19 and need greater accountability in the future. http
SenRonJohnson,These facts were provided to the @user well in advance of publication and proved there was no story at all.But the reporter first reached a conclusion and then selected facts that supported his narrative. This is not journalism. It is partisan activism.
SenRonJohnson,The total number of reimbursements involved in the @user hit piece is 18 over 8 years which is just more than 2 per year on average.The total value is extremely similar to reimbursements made to other senators and again is in compliance with Senate rules.
SenRonJohnson,Every travel reimbursement follows an audit process and goes through the Senate Rules Committee which must ultimately approve of any reimbursements.Every single reimbursement has gone through the proper process and is in complete compliance with Senate rules.
SenRonJohnson,Senators can be reimbursed for travel to official business from somewhere other than their duty station as long as the cost is equal to or less than the cost of traveling from the duty station. This means my travel cost the taxpayer the same amount or less.
SenRonJohnson,Here’s the truth: I have never been reimbursed for travel to visit family in Florida although the story leaves the impression that I have.Per Senate rules Senators can be reimbursed for travel back to official business in D.C.This is precisely what happened.
SenRonJohnson,This is a garbage story produced by the @user for DC Democrats which ignores many of the facts my team provided.It is a coordinated smear tactic and Wisconsinites are smart enough to see through it. http
SenRonJohnson,This isn't journalism it’s advocacy.It is a fully coordinated attack by the Dem Party and their allies in the media.When the truth isn't on their side Dems and MSM media lie distort and engage in the politics of personal destruction.Wisconsin and America deserve better. http
SenRonJohnson,I’m joining @user on @user at 1:00pm ET today. Tune in! http
SenRonJohnson,Not surprising that the Democrat leader would lie about the bill he blocked that parents of Parkland victims have been trying to pass for years.  Dems aren’t looking for solutions they want wedge issues that they hope will keep them in power. Sick. http
SenRonJohnson,Today I asked for unanimous consent for passage of the Luke and Alex School Safety Act.But @user blocked this common sense legislation in favor of his partisan agenda.It’s a very sad day in the United States Senate. http
SenRonJohnson,At 2:00pm I'll be on the Senate floor asking my colleagues for unanimous consent to pass common sense legislation - the Luke and Alex School Safety Act.https://t.co/fX9TgZbyy1
