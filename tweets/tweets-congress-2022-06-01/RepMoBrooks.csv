RepMoBrooks,America owes an eternal debt of gratitude to the men and women who have selflessly laid down their lives for America’s freedom. Today let us remember these brave men and women and keep their families in our thoughts and prayers. http
RepMoBrooks,This week I signed onto a House Republican letter to President Biden requesting further documentation on the proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations. It is time to stop wasting the taxpayer dollars of the American people and instead defund the WHO. http
RepMoBrooks,Gas prices are soaring right now. Earlier this week the average price per gallon in the U.S. was $4.59. Yet the Biden Administration continues to make Americans suffer because they have chosen to make us reliant on other countries for oil. http
RepMoBrooks,America has the highest inflation rate since the early 1980’s. What is President Biden’s solution to all of this? Spend more money! The Biden Administration continues to dig America into a financial black hole. http
