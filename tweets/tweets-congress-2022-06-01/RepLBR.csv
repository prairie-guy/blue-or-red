RepLBR,As we close out #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth please remember to take time for yourself when you need it. With all that's going on it's never been important to prioritize your mental health. #MentalHealthMatters http

RepLBR,I recently had the honor of visiting Arlington National Cemetery with a bipartisan group of colleagues. There is truly no more humbling or profound experience than seeing the hundreds of thousands of headstones marking the lives &amp; legacies of those who gave everything in service. http
RepLBR,I had to take the train to Washington today for a last-minute meeting. And as I walked out of the Capitol - I saw a group of hundreds of people gathered to send a clear message to the Senate to act NOW to #EndGunViolence.Here was my message to them. http
RepLBR,It is our duty as elected officials to keep our communities safe. I'm calling on the Senate to vote on these bills NOW and show the American people where they stand. Our lives depend on it. #StopGunViolence (3/3)
RepLBR,Congress must find a path forward &amp; pass comprehensive common-sense gun violence prevention legislation. The House has already passed legislation to address gun violence including bills to establish background check requirements and close the Charleston Loophole. (2/3)
RepLBR,Here we are again - living in the aftermath of another heinous act of gun violence watching families suffer. These deaths could have been prevented. We must end this vicious cycle now. üßµ(1/3)
