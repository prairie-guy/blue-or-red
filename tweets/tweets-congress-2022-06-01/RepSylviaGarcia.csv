RepSylviaGarcia,In Houston one in five people lives in poverty -- a rate far higher than the national average. Houston Janitors are ready to fight for $15 and a fair contract.Getting a path to $15 would only cost one penny more per square foot per month -- so #raisethewage! http
RepSylviaGarcia,Recently I joined @user @user on the @user show to discuss the #Uvalde shooting. One thing is clear -- enough is enough. I call on the Senate to pass much-needed gun safety legislation NOW. http

RepSylviaGarcia,My colleagues in the Senate if you ever needed to bust the filibuster I'll give you 19 reasons to do it -- it's those 19 little angels who are watching from above. @Newsy http
RepSylviaGarcia,Gun violence is the leading cause of death among children. In 2020 4357 children were shot and killed. Gun violence numbers are trending upward across the country. I will stand up for America’s children. http
RepSylviaGarcia,This morning I joined @user on @user to discuss the #Uvalde elementary school shooting. The House has passed common-sense gun safety legislation only for the bills to die at the hands of Senate Republicans. The Senate MUST act. Our children are dying. http
RepSylviaGarcia,My prayers go out to the families across #uvaldetx. I can't imagine the pain and suffering families are feeling right now. More must be done to protect our children. We can't allow this nightmare to continue. http
