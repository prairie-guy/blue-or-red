RepLeeZeldin,John Hinckley's debt to society is not yet repaid after shooting and nearly killing the President of the United States 41 years ago. He should spend the rest of his life behind bars. Full stop!
RepLeeZeldin,Imagine being so desperate in wanting a political issue to campaign on that you refuse to support measures to improve physical security at schools against all outside threats. This is absolutely weak disgraceful posturing by the Biden Admin. http
RepLeeZeldin,New York must reverse its boneheaded ban on the safe extraction of natural gas.
RepLeeZeldin,Qualified immunity should absolutely not be eliminated for law enforcement. Our amazing men and women in blue should be allowed to do their jobs without worrying about being personally sued wrongly!
RepLeeZeldin,None of us would have this opportunity and gift to live our lives in the greatest nation in the history of the world if not for courageous men and women who answered the call to serve in defense of our freedom and liberties and paid the ultimate sacrifice. #MemorialDay ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
RepLeeZeldin,Every school in New York should have armed trained school resource officers.
RepLeeZeldin,New Yorkâ€™s Asian American community is under attack. Raw violent hate using hands knives hammers &amp; more are causing serious bodily harm on others &amp; even death. We need to back the blue FIRE Bragg repeal cashless bail &amp; much more to regain control of our streets &amp; subways. http
RepLeeZeldin,New York City is STILL requiring toddlers to be masked up all day. This unscientific child abuse needs to end NOW! ALL COVID mandates should be gone TODAY everywhere!
RepLeeZeldin,NY leads the entire country in population loss and this is the topic Kathy Hochul wants to distract us to. http
RepLeeZeldin,Another innocent life was lost in New York because of pro-criminal bail laws. Despite his previous criminal history a Brooklyn judge freed Daniel Enriquez's would-be killer without bail. New York's bail laws must change now!https://t.co/Si6WV2ysX7
RepLeeZeldin,The result of pro-criminal policies in New York is that law-abiding citizens are no longer in control of their streets subways and lives. https://t.co/YeMuSMcAiK
