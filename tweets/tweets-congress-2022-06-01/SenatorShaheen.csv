SenatorShaheen,Mental illness is not unique to the U.S. but the devastating rate of gun violence is.  It's time to focus on the heart of the issue – Congress must take action on meaningful gun reform to save lives. https://t.co/SNVxbVituO
SenatorShaheen,NH is a top destination for visitors and it’s great to see the tourism season kicked off with a strong start this weekend! Our booming tourism industry supports small businesses &amp; job creation across the state. https://t.co/9wcoMy7dD0
SenatorShaheen,I applaud the EU for enacting the biggest blow yet to the Kremlin’s cashflow. The U.S. stands in lockstep w/ our European partners to reduce Europe’s energy dependence on Russia. http
SenatorShaheen,Inflation is one of the top concerns I hear from Granite Staters. @user is rightly focused on attacking high costs – I'm committed to working with the admin &amp; fellow lawmakers to lower costs for working families. https://t.co/rZ9dpg2GeH
SenatorShaheen,Every day we should remember those who fought &amp; died defending our liberty so that we may never take for granted the freedoms we enjoy.
SenatorShaheen,I was honored to be at the NH Veterans Cemetery in Boscawen with @user today to pay tribute to our fallen heroes &amp; military families on Memorial Day. http
SenatorShaheen,Congrats to Shannon Wydra for receiving the Novice Educator of the Year award from the NH Science Teachers’ Association! Incredible to see the impact you’ve already had on your students &amp; field – thank you for setting an example for educators across NH.  https://t.co/R7QfYgaMw5
SenatorShaheen,NH’s outdoor spaces are a treasure enjoyed by Granite Staters &amp; have always been a staple in our tourism economy. I’ll continue to support programs like the LWCF to preserve public lands in NH &amp; I’m glad to join this bipartisan res commemorating June as Great Outdoors Month! http
SenatorShaheen,Kudos to Eliana and Samantha Dominguez for creating a Multicultural Student Union at the Derryfield School. This effort emphasizes the importance of providing students of color with a safe space to embrace culture &amp; find community. https://t.co/rRWxdZhYFx
SenatorShaheen,Glad to support this bipartisan resolution condemning Putin for the unjust detention of Vladimir Kara-Murza &amp; calling for his swift release. Putin’s imprisonment of the opposition underscores his fear of democracy and dissent. He must be held accountable. http
SenatorShaheen,22 terms &amp; 4 decades of service in the NH House – what a milestone. Thank you Rep. Laura Pantelakos for the indelible impact you’ve left on the Granite State – your contributions will be felt for generations to come. http
SenatorShaheen,Students should never fear for their safety in the classroom. It’s heartbreaking to hear these Granite State students react to this week’s school massacre – this cannot be our status quo.Congress can and must take action to stop these senseless deaths.https://t.co/SvoQPTrvnm
SenatorShaheen,I remember what it was like to be a mom with children on formula – for parents still scrambling to feed their babies @user is helping NH families find formula.  More info on resources available for Granite State parents here: https://t.co/XvBRQLgcc6
SenatorShaheen,Excited to see $8.6M in federal dollars heading to key NH projects. As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee ensuring the Corps has the resources it needs every year to prioritize local projects is always a top concern. http
SenatorShaheen,I’m wondering the same thing @user http
SenatorShaheen,The GOP response rings hollow as long as these same lawmakers refuse to consider common-sense reform that will reduce gun violence &amp; help keep communities safe. Enough is enough.
SenatorShaheen,Just as the international community has rallied around welcoming Ukrainian refugees a pathway to safety should be provided to Afghans fleeing the Taliban’s danger. I’m joining a letter w/ @user to ensure a level playing field for Afghans applying for humanitarian parole. http
SenatorShaheen,What does it say about the GOP that they won’t even engage on a common-sense bill to address domestic terrorism? This is about keeping communities safe. The political grandstanding is making our country less secure – it has got to stop.https://t.co/DOcAUO52pp
SenatorShaheen,Proud to have helped launch the 988 Lifeline.  Starting in July Granite Staters experiencing a mental health crisis can dial 9-8-8 and get access to the help they need. http
SenatorShaheen,We need more than thoughts &amp; prayers to stop gun violence: we need policy and action.
SenatorShaheen,"""Schoolchildren. Teachers. Executed on their own campus. Murdered in the place where they should be safe where they should be growing and becoming. ""As a nation we lack the capacity to seriously grapple with gun violence.” We cannot accept this status quo. http"
SenatorShaheen,More than 200 mass shootings in 2022 and it’s only May. We’ve seen more mass shootings than days in the year. Inaction is not an option. Our children and communities living in fear deserve better.
SenatorShaheen,In the wake of the Uvalde massacre today I chaired a hearing w/ @user Director Wray. Congress must work with the FBI to stem gun violence &amp; domestic terrorism.  My opening remarks below: http
SenatorShaheen,For the families who woke up with dread in their hearts &amp; who will never feel whole again I won't give up on sensible gun reform. @GOP – come to the table and work with us to end these massacres.
