SenJackReed,Folks from @user truly living up to their motto of ‘Service Above Self’ &amp; reaching out to support the children &amp; families of Uvalde. No child grieves alone &amp; we mourn with all those affected by the Uvalde shooting &amp; will continue to support them. http
SenJackReed,Great to see $3.15M in federal Brownfields funding flowing to RI for neighborhood revitalization &amp; community-led cleanup and development. Brownfields turns formerly contaminated sites into productive neighborhood assets &amp; economic engines of opportunity http
SenJackReed,This Memorial Day we pause to honor and remember the courageous sacrifice of those U.S. military servicemembers who gave their lives in defense of our great nation. http
SenJackReed,Thanks to everyone who came out to the Jamestown Memorial Day parade today to help honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice defending our country &amp; our freedom. http
SenJackReed,An important part of Memorial Day is paying respect. One way to do that is by following the #flagetiquette for Memorial Day: Hoist the flag to its peak; then fly it half-staff until noon; before raising it to full-staff. #HonorTheFallen http
SenJackReed,Better background checks on gun sales will save lives. Period. By doing nothing and blocking more effective background checks Republicans are making a choice: that mass-shootings are not as important as getting NRA-backing. Until that changes nothing will change. http
SenJackReed,Congratulations @user &amp; Ted! Baby Samantha is lucky to have such wonderful parents. And of course she was introduced to the world through a tweet by Ted!https://t.co/ND0rleMrh4
