JoaquinCastrotx,Struggling with the cost of high-speed internet?Last year I voted to create the Affordable Connectivity Program a new federal discount program for internet services. Tonight at 5 @user is joining me at Dwight Middle School to help families enroll. Learn more ⤵️ http
JoaquinCastrotx,@user I hear you - although the state authorities aren’t the most honest brokers.
JoaquinCastrotx,In 2022 every family should have a high-speed internet connection at home.Tomorrow from 5-6:30 PM @user is joining me at Dwight Middle School to help families enroll in a new federal discount program for internet service. We hope to see you there. http
JoaquinCastrotx,Yet another disturbing inconsistency offered by state authorities about the Uvalde shooting. http
JoaquinCastrotx,On #MemorialDay we honor those who lost their lives in service to our nation.We are forever grateful to them for their bravery courage and sacrifice to protect our freedom. http
JoaquinCastrotx,When I met with Uvalde families they told me how worried they are about children going back to Robb Elementary.No child should have to return to the scene of this tragedy. Along w/state local &amp; federal leaders I'll work to get Uvalde any money it needs to build a new school. http
JoaquinCastrotx,I'm relieved that the Justice Department is conducting a public review of how law enforcement responded to the Uvalde shooting. Families of the victims and the survivors deserve to know why law enforcement waited so long to confront the shooter. http
JoaquinCastrotx,After finishing his speech this common man was chauffeured to “Uptown Sushi” in the wealthiest part of Houston. http
JoaquinCastrotx,Wow. http
JoaquinCastrotx,And I said I would do everything possible to keep more American communities from suffering in the same way because of senseless gun violence. They all demanded change. (3/3)
JoaquinCastrotx,I promised to get to the truth about what happened to their loved ones and why it took so long to stop the shooter. (2/3)
JoaquinCastrotx,I went to Uvalde today to pay my respects and meet with family members of the victims and community members. I told them that San Antonio and the nation grieve with them. (1/3)
JoaquinCastrotx,If @user intends do anything in response to the #UvaldeMassacre he will call a Special Session of the Texas Legislature in the next few days. If he doesn’t it means he’s going to do nothing except wait for the intense media spotlight to move on. #Uvalde
JoaquinCastrotx,For every reporter covering the Uvalde shooting this is an essential point especially considering today’s press conference. http
JoaquinCastrotx,También le he pedido al FBI que investigue si el atacante estaba o debería haber estado en el radar de las autoridades antes del tiroteo. Seguiré presionando para obtener más respuestas.
JoaquinCastrotx,Ayer le pedí al FBI que produciera un informe completo transparente y público sobre el tiroteo la cronología y la respuesta de las autoridades.Lea mi carta aquí: http
JoaquinCastrotx,Como la mayoría de Tejanos y Estadounidenses estoy frustrado por los relatos contradictorios que las autoridades estatales han proporcionado sobre cómo se desarrollo el incidente y me preocupa que las autoridades no detuvieron el atacante mas pronto.
JoaquinCastrotx,4. El FBI no cree que el atacante fue motivado por una ideología en particular y no cree que hubo co-conspiradores.
JoaquinCastrotx,3. El FBI está usando sus equipos de análisis de redes sociales computadoras y celulares para examinar las plataformas en línea y los dispositivos electrónicos utilizados por el atacante y construir una cronología clara de lo que sucedió antes durante y después del tiroteo.
JoaquinCastrotx,2. Los especialistas del Equipo de Respuesta de Servicios a las Víctimas del FBI procesarán todos los objetos en la escuela que necesitan ser devueltos a las familias de las víctimas y los sobrevivientes.
JoaquinCastrotx,1. El FBI ha movilizado recursos de investigación para examinar la cronología de los eventos en Uvalde y la evidencia de la escena trabajando junto pero independientemente del Departamento de Seguridad Pública de Texas (Texas DPS) y los Texas Rangers.
JoaquinCastrotx,Esta mañana tuve una junta con la Oficina Federal de Investigaciones (FBI) sobre la investigación del tiroteo en Uvalde. Esto es lo que aprendí:
JoaquinCastrotx,.@GovAbbott is a liar. #Uvalde http
JoaquinCastrotx,I’ve also asked the FBI to look into whether the shooter was — or should have been — on the radar of law enforcement before the shooting. I will continue to press for answers.
JoaquinCastrotx,Yesterday I asked the FBI to produce a full transparent and public report on the shooting the timeline and the response by law enforcement.Read my letter here: http
JoaquinCastrotx,Like most Texans and Americans I’m deeply frustrated by the conflicting accounts that state authorities have provided about how events unfolded and I’m disturbed by law enforcement’s failure to confront and stop the shooter sooner.
JoaquinCastrotx,4. The FBI does not believe the shooter was motivated by a particular ideology and does not believe there were co-conspirators. The shooter was not on the FBI’s radar prior to the massacre.
JoaquinCastrotx,3. The FBI is also leveraging its social media computer and cellular analysis teams to examine the online platforms and electronic devices used by the shooter and build a clear timeline of what happened before during and after the shooting.
JoaquinCastrotx,2. Specialists from the FBI’s Victim Services Response Team will process all items in the school that need to be returned to the families of the victims and the survivors.
JoaquinCastrotx,1. The FBI has mobilized extensive investigative resources to examine the timeline of events in Uvalde and evidence from the scene working alongside but independent of Texas DPS and the Texas Rangers.
JoaquinCastrotx,This morning I met with the @user about its investigation into the Uvalde shooting. Here’s what I learned:
JoaquinCastrotx,The American people but most of all the families in Uvalde deserve to know the timeline of law enforcement's response to the Uvalde shooting.State authorities have provided conflicting reports to the public.The @user must investigate. http
JoaquinCastrotx,I know many folks are wondering whether this is real. This is a serious allegation made anonymously and shouldn’t be treated as true unless vetted and verified. http
JoaquinCastrotx,@user Please DM me if I can be helpful.
JoaquinCastrotx,Read my full letter to @user Director Christopher Wray:https://t.co/VfcndXBaTT
JoaquinCastrotx,State authorities have provided the public with conflicting accounts of how the tragedy in Uvalde unfolded. I’m calling on the @user to use their maximum authority to investigate and provide a full report on the timeline the law enforcement response and how 21 Texans were killed.
JoaquinCastrotx,@user @user Which authorities exactly?
JoaquinCastrotx,@user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user Where did you get these screenshots?
JoaquinCastrotx,As a parent my heart aches at the pain families are experiencing in Uvalde after yesterday’s horrific shooting.Tonight I joined San Antonians at a vigil at Main Plaza to mourn the victims and stand in silence and solidarity with the Uvalde community. http
