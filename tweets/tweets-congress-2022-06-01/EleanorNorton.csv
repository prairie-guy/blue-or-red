EleanorNorton,200000 DC residents have served in the military since WWI. This Memorial Day I honored DC servicemembers for giving life and limb for a country that denies them voting representation in Congress and full local self-government. #DCStatehood
EleanorNorton,I applaud the executive order requiring federal police officers to use body cameras. However Congress must also pass my bill with @user that requires the use of body and dashboard cameras so that a future administration cannot undo the camera requirement.
EleanorNorton,Release: http
EleanorNorton,Republicans in Congress have been trying for years to repeal DC’s gun violence prevention laws including its ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines but I’ve defeated each attempt. They are likely to try again if they are in the majority. #HandsOffDC #DCStatehood
EleanorNorton,Ahead of #MemorialDay2022 I introduced a resolution honoring DC servicemembers and veterans who have fought in every American war since the Revolutionary War but still don't have voting representation in Congress. The remedy is #DCStatehood.Release: http
EleanorNorton,Russia has permanently barred me among others from entering Russia because of my opposition to its unprovoked and brutal war in Ukraine. I’ll continue to support Ukraine and to hold Russia accountable for its war.
EleanorNorton,In 2012 I defeated legislation that would have nationalized the DC War Memorial preserving it for DC servicemembers only. The memorial commemorates the 499 DC residents who died in WWI more than the number from three states. #MemorialDay2022
EleanorNorton,Gun violence is the leading cause of death among children and teenagers. We have legislation ready to go to stop gun violence and save lives in every community across the country. It’s time for Republicans to get out of the way of stopping gun violence. #gunviolenceprevention
EleanorNorton,@user nominated Judge Florence Pan of the U.S. District Court for DC whom I recommended for the district court to the U.S. Circuit Court for DC. Pan has the professional experience and academic credentials to be an outstanding circuit judge.Details: http
EleanorNorton,However I’m still waiting for a response to the rest of my questions and I will continue to push for greater transparency from NPS regarding the crash and their investigations more broadly.Details: http
EleanorNorton,After my letter NPS finally provided the name of the driver to the victims’ families without which they could not file life insurance claims.
EleanorNorton,@user provided an interim response to my letter demanding answers on the investigation into a car crash that killed two pedestrians at Hains Point last year.
