JacksonLeeTX18,These investigations will also include the recent mass murders in Buffalo NY. The families that are mourning after these mass murders need and deserve answers now and we must also pass real gun safety legislation without hesitation. Enough is enough!
JacksonLeeTX18,I am also calling for Congressional hearings to investigate the facts of the mass murders in Uvalde and to listen to the people there in order to find out exactly what happened with the attempted rescue of the victims and the attempted effort to kill or stop the assailant.
JacksonLeeTX18,After visiting Uvalde Texas and seeing that the mass murders were caused by a mixture of hatred and a violent assault weapon it is now imperative that we pass an assault weapons ban and a 7-day waiting period for the purchase of any automatic weapon immediately.
JacksonLeeTX18,For the families in these communities the pain is deep and can never be healed. At least for this Memorial Day we can honor those who have fallen in battle by living up to our values--Life Liberty and peace by passing gun safety legislation now.
JacksonLeeTX18,The House Judiciary Committee is working steadfastly to get a real gun safety bill to the President's desk after the scheduled markup later this week. The nation should never see another Buffalo or Uvalde ever again.
