RepPeteStauber,I’m grateful for the tour of @user facility in Duluth. I had the chance to hear about their current struggles with energy costs labor shortages and how mining restrictions affect their business. http
RepPeteStauber,Skyrocketing costs are taking a toll on the American people especially our working class &amp; those on fixed incomes. While everything is getting more expensive paychecks are not keeping up. No more reckless spending in Washington! http
RepPeteStauber,"It's unconscionable that as gas prices are at historic highs Biden says it is part of an ""incredible transition."" First he blamed the energy sector &amp; then Putin. Now he is trying to tell us this was the plan? American families need answers not excuses."
RepPeteStauber,Wonderful news for Duluth &amp; our surrounding communities! Cruises support our tourism-driven economy and are a great way for more visitors to experience all the Northland has to offer.https://t.co/92sol9Wyuw
RepPeteStauber,Today I joined fellow northern Minnesotans in Keewatin and Hibbing to honor and remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms. http
RepPeteStauber,Our rights and liberty have come at an extraordinary cost &amp; we must never forget those who paid with their lives. This Memorial Day we remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. May God always be with our fallen soldiers our troops and their families. http
RepPeteStauber,Proud to join @user in demanding the US withdraw from the World Health Organization. The WHO’s deference to the Chinese Communist Party shows they cannot be trusted. http
RepPeteStauber,Building trade jobs and apprenticeships create opportunities for good-paying jobs in our workforce and help grow our economy. http
RepPeteStauber,It was an honor to attend the @user Gala last night to celebrate their amazing work to raise awareness &amp; encourage groundbreaking research. As the father of a son living with Down Syndrome it warms my heart to see people come together for such a great cause. http
