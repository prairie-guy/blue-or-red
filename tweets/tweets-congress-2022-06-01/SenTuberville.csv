SenTuberville,Read my full letter to @user ⬇️ http
SenTuberville,As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of #TitleIX this year we must also call out blatant attempts to undermine protections for women and girls. The NCAA has dropped the ball by allowing the female sports divisions to include anyone failing women &amp; decimating fairness in sports.
SenTuberville,Contrary to the media narrative peer-reviewed studies confirm that reducing testosterone doesn't remove biological advantages.Yet a biological man repeatedly swept female collegiate swim meets because @user abandoned its responsibility to protect collegiate athletes.
SenTuberville,The Biden administration's expected modifications to #TitleIX will destroy opportunities for generations of women and girls at the behest of liberal extremism. http
SenTuberville,Every Chinese company is an extension of the Chinese Communist Party. A new report shows how the Chinese government is undermining American businesses by subsidizing failing industries.https://t.co/5TTcDITTOF

SenTuberville,Every year on #MemorialDay we pause to remember these heroes and reflect on the price they paid for our freedom. Today I would like to honor some of Alabama's fallen soldiers who have paid freedom's high cost and the Gold Star families who still grieve their absence.
SenTuberville,Our freedom has been protected by those who stood against evil endured sleepless nights on the battlefield rough days at sea &amp; spent years living in far corners of the globe so we can live peacefully. Some heroes never return home.  https://t.co/NhrvYhk79O
