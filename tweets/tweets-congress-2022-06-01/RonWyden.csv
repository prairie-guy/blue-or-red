RonWyden,I’m not going to stop pressing for a halt to this disgraceful spectacle coming to Washington County — and for Greg Norman and any other supporters of this Saudi tour to quit “sportswashing” bloodstained Saudi hands.
RonWyden,This Saudi-backed golf tournament coming to Oregon is a cruel insult to the family of Fallon Smart a 15-year-old Portlander killed in a hit-and-run by a Saudi national whose government has helped him escape U.S. justice. http
RonWyden,Never miss a chance here in Eugene to check out @user gear at a local icon like Hiron’s right down Franklin Boulevard from @user #GoDucks http
RonWyden,Honored to stand today here in Lane County with @user &amp; @user — and every day — in the fight to protect safe and legal abortion against extremists scheming to turn back the clock on this health care right as well as on birth control and contraception. http
RonWyden,As America celebrates the 50th anniversary of how #TitleIX generated long-overdue opportunities for women in sports I’m proud we have Oregon Congresswoman Edith Green a @user grad to thank for this landmark achievement. #GoDucks https://t.co/YwtB0iZFaH
RonWyden,Honored this #MemorialDay2022 to be at Eagle Point National Cemetery with everybody gathered today at this sacred spot in Southern Oregon remembering their loved ones who lost their lives in courageous service to our country. http
RonWyden,Proud to have worked with @user to secure $2.5 million in federal funding for the Salmon SuperHighway — a project here in Bear Creek doing important work to protect iconic salmon and steelhead habitat. http
RonWyden,Huge thanks to the @user for hosting yesterday’s #2022townhall in Tillamook County. Productive and insightful discussions on voting rights health care for veterans common-sense gun reform and the infant formula crisis families are facing in Oregon and nationwide. http
RonWyden,I heard loud and clear from Oregonians on the coast that federal agencies have a lot of work to do to bring folks to the table to ensure our communities are heard on offshore wind power. I’ll continue working to make sure every voice is taken into account.
RonWyden,Grateful to hear from Oregonians at today’s #2022townhall in Lincoln County about the urgent need for common sense gun laws as well as inflation &amp; responsible forestry ahead of the fire season. Thanks @user for hosting and sending us home with some Oregon smoked salmon. http
RonWyden,A trip to Lincoln City isn’t complete without making a stop to see Jeff and Lynne at the iconic @user to grab a loaf of their famous sourdough bread. http
RonWyden,If you're a resident of Lincoln Tillamook Deschutes Wasco and Hood River counties be sure to sign up for my upcoming #2022townhalls with @user or watch live on my Facebook page. http
RonWyden,I've always believed the cornerstone of public service is making yourself available to hear the concerns of your constituents. That's more important now than ever and why I'm continuing my promise to hold at least one open-to-all town hall in every Oregon county every year.
RonWyden,It's past time for a comprehensive approach to addressing the mental health crisis. Our bipartisan framework will create a Bill of Rights so Americans with Medicare know when and how they can use telehealth to get mental health care they need. http
RonWyden,Republicans are making it clear that ahead of another upcoming election not even the mass slaughter of innocent children will get in the way of them pocketing NRA campaign donations in exchange for inaction. http
RonWyden,Three years later and thanks to several rounds of Republican budget cuts the IRS is unable to hold the NRA accountable for its efforts to undermine a U.S. presidential election.
RonWyden,In 2019 my team and I found overwhelming evidence confirming the NRA was acting as a Russian asset granting access to prominent Republicans in exchange for lucrative gifts and favors. Years later we’ve seen no public accountability. http
RonWyden,Overturning Roe will be the biggest blow to Americans' privacy in our generation. This week @user and I led 40 of our colleagues in calling on @user to limit collection and storage of location data to protect women in a post-Roe America. http
RonWyden,I'm proud of the bipartisan progress we have made to address this crisis but there is more work to be done. I remain committed to tackling the mental health crisis to ensure Americans can access the care they desperately need.
RonWyden,The pandemic made it clear that telehealth is a game-changer in helping Americans get mental health care where and when they need it. Today's framework will help expand access to telehealth options for those seeking care.
RonWyden,As Chair of @user I pledged to make mental health care one of my top priorities. Today the Committee is delivering on that promise as we release our bipartisan framework to expand telehealth options for Americans seeking mental health care. http
RonWyden,Atrocity after atrocity Republicans offer empty thoughts and prayers to families grieving loved ones lost to gun violence. If you don't have the moral courage to act on the Senate floor to prevent these massacres you should go home and let somebody else have the job. http
RonWyden,Coach Kerr spoke for millions of Americans when he said we can’t get numb to mass shootings it's time to do the hard work to get 60 votes on commonsense gun legislation. The Senate can and must act. http
