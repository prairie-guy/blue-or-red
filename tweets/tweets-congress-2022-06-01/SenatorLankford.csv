SenatorLankford,Instead of looking into the alarming allegations of fetal tissue research at the University of Pittsburgh the Biden Admin has ignored them.I am calling on the Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services to audit the investigation into the University of Pittsburgh’s fetal tissue research. http
SenatorLankford,The Biden Admin is directly responsible for the astronomical gas prices we’re seeing. http
SenatorLankford,I will never vote to give up US sovereignty to an international organization like @user The Biden Admin can’t force an international agreement on us without a vote in Congress and there is NO WAY I am going to give away American’s rights. https://t.co/L9a8c67qTJ
SenatorLankford,The men &amp; women who gave everything for the sake of our liberty are not forgotten. They are our heroes—&amp; we remember. #MemorialDay http
SenatorLankford,In Arizona today to see what needs to be done—found the steel to finish the border wall to help secure our nation has been baking in the Arizona sun since January 2021. http
SenatorLankford,My colleagues &amp; I are giving that question a firm answer; yes sex offenses are violent crimes &amp; should lead to immediate deportation for those found guilty. Period.
SenatorLankford,I am at the US-Mexico border today to assess the current situation at the border.  Every Oklahoman believes that an illegal immigrant who is a kidnapper or commits sexual assault should be deported.https://t.co/bdAz48zX9d
SenatorLankford,The relocation that comes with serving in our nation’s Armed Forces has prevented our military spouses from seeking a career—until now.
SenatorLankford,The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that we are ready for almost anyone to work from almost anywhere which gave us this opportunity to help military spouses find &amp; keep a career while their spouse also serves our nation.
SenatorLankford,I’m working to make it easier for our military spouses to have a career. https://t.co/Q7WreYGmRh
SenatorLankford,The Biden Admin is directly responsible for the astronomical gas prices we’re seeing. http
SenatorLankford,There are a quarter of a million people a month now coming across the border—half of those people Border Patrol are able to turnaround because of Title 42—but Biden &amp; his team actually want all of that quarter of a million people to come in to the US. http
SenatorLankford,Last month 250000+ people illegally crossed the border—we have got to get serious about solving the problems at our border. http
SenatorLankford,Talking with @user on @user @user about the #BidenBorderCrisis—tune in.
SenatorLankford,ICE has stated that they do not have the capacity to fly people back to their home country but they are apparently willing to bus or fly people into Oklahoma for release to their family members.  7/7
SenatorLankford,Currently record-high numbers of around 8000 people per day are illegally crossing our southern border while the Biden Administration has decreased interior deportations to record-low numbers of just over 200 people a day. 6/7
SenatorLankford,The Biden Administration spares no expense to facilitate the transition and entry of migrants into the United States.  5/7
SenatorLankford,I have visited multiple locations along the border where unaccompanied minors are detained for processing into the country and have seen firsthand the housing arrangements.  4/7
SenatorLankford,We should be working to have less illegal entry instead of facilitating more illegal entry.    3/7
SenatorLankford,However the bulk of unaccompanied minors crossing our southern border are older teenagers mostly male who are coming to connect with family members who are already illegally present in the United States.  2/7
SenatorLankford,I will strongly and vocally oppose this plan. Oklahomans respect legal immigration and have great compassion for any young child surrendered to human traffickers by their parents. 1/7 http
SenatorLankford,That's classified. http
