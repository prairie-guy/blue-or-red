RepCleaver,I was honored to join Gold Star families veterans and servicemembers for a solemn #MemorialDay ceremony at @user yesterday afternoon. May God bless each of our men and women in uniform for their extraordinary sacrifice and dedicated service to the nation. http
RepCleaver,Thanks to the #AmericanRescuePlan unemployment is near historic lows 220 million Americans are vaccinated household financial well-being reached an all-time high &amp; new businesses are being created at record rates.See how @user plans to continue building on this progress: http
RepCleaver,This #MemorialDay let us come together to honor the men and women who lost their lives defending the freedoms we cherish so dearly. Today and everyday we give thanks to the servicemembers veterans and military families who have sacrificed so much for our nation. http
RepCleaver,Some would rather shut down schools than take common sense steps to #EndGunViolence and mass shootings. Enough is enough! Our kids deserve better.https://t.co/eWCnuC0tCT
RepCleaver,Let’s make it happen @user Cancelling $10000 in federal student loan debt would settle the balances of roughly 1/3 of borrowers while cutting debt in half for another 20%. A boon for our economic recovery and a major step in the right direction. http
RepCleaver,Much work left to do to lower costs #ForThePeople but this is welcome news.I will continue working with @user &amp; @user to maintain the record job creation &amp; economic growth witnessed under the Biden Administration as we combat global inflation &amp; the #PutinPriceHike. http
RepCleaver,How can anyone listen to the stories of these kids and not want to take immediate action to ensure this never happens again? Nowhere else in the world do we see mass shootings like we do in America. We know the solutions we just have to find the courage to enact them. http
RepCleaver,The U.S. has witnessed more than 210 mass shootings in 2022. That’s nearly 1.5 per day.The American people are sick and tired of GOP obstruction enabling preventable tragedies.If some in Congress are going to allow this carnage to continue members shouldn’t be compensated. http
RepCleaver,Missouri has one of the highest rates of lead pipe usage in America.But thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law we have an opportunity to remove lead pipes across the state &amp; ensure our communities have clean drinking water.This is how we build a better America for all! http
RepCleaver,While the process to import formula from Europe typically takes 3-4 weeks @user and the Biden Administration’s Operation Fly Formula has cut that time down to 3 days. We’ll keep working until every family has easy access to the formula their baby needs. http
RepCleaver,Republicans in the Senate are obstructing legislation to: -#EndGunViolence-Combat domestic terrorism-Provide funding to get formula back on shelves more quickly-Prevent price gouging from Big Oil Enough is enough! Stop obstructing and start taking action #ForThePeople http
RepCleaver,Red Flag laws are common sense and have proven to be effective. I’m hopeful that Republicans in the Senate will FINALLY stand up and take action to help #EndGunViolence and save lives.https://t.co/UzSESEpvq9
RepCleaver,2 years ago George Floyd was murdered under the knee of a police officer. As we reflect on the horror of that day we must also honor Mr. Floyd with action on police reform. Today thanks to @user @user &amp; @user we’re taking a major step toward progress. http
RepCleaver,This kind of gun violence only occurs in America—and it’s a choice.We can prevent these disturbing and devastating massacres if we want. But thoughts and prayers aren’t going to cut it.We need concrete action like background checks red flag laws and an assault weapons ban. http
RepCleaver,.@HouseDemocrats have passed several common sense gun safety laws to strengthen background checks and keep weapons of war out of the wrong hands—which should be the absolute bare minimum. Now the Senate must step up and take action to protect Americans. http
RepCleaver,I am devastated and heartbroken for the families of the victims and the entire Uvalde community—a community that will never be the same again. We must honor each of these beautiful souls by taking concrete steps to #EndGunViolence. Enough is enough! http
