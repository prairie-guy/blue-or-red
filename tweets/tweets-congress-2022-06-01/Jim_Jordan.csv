Jim_Jordan,The average price of gas in Ohio jumped 15 cents in 24 hours. And it’s not getting better anytime soon. https://t.co/xapWAZkVzC
Jim_Jordan,$4.79 a gallon.
Jim_Jordan,Americans are seeing $8 gas in some parts of the country. It’s only getting worse. And Joe Biden still refuses to increase domestic oil production. Unbelievable.

Jim_Jordan,Reacting to the Sussmann trial and more on Fox News with @user at 11:00 a.m. Tune in!
Jim_Jordan,Joe Biden says we’re experiencing the “most robust” economic recovery in history. If by that he means $5 gas record inflation and soaring grocery prices then sure it’s robust.
Jim_Jordan,On #MemorialDay we remember the brave men and women who paid the ultimate price for our country and freedom. From Bunker Hill to Benghazi to Baghdad never forget their sacrifice.
Jim_Jordan,Hero. http
Jim_Jordan,God Bless the men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our country. https://t.co/7BjrLfgzQ1
Jim_Jordan,Sussmann billed the Clinton campaign on the day he talked about the Trump-Russia hoax with the FBI. But he also wants you to believe he wasn’t talking to the FBI on anyone’s behalf. Can’t have it both ways. https://t.co/0DByY4W5y3
Jim_Jordan,Don't forget the reason you have a long weekend this Memorial Day. God Bless our Gold Star families.
Jim_Jordan,America needs more faith more family and more freedom.

Jim_Jordan,Imagine how much more President Trump could have accomplished for America if not for the Russia hoax and Hillary Clinton’s dirty tricks.
Jim_Jordan,They wanted to send the military to your school board meetings. Insanity. https://t.co/cuhlyKJQfC
Jim_Jordan,The media told you the Russia hoax was true. Now they’re telling you that Hillary Clinton didn’t help launch it. How can anyone trust them?
Jim_Jordan,Remember when Major League Baseball moved the All-Star game from Atlanta? So much “voter suppression.” http
