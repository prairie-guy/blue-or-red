RepDeSaulnier,I’ve been fighting for the widespread use of this technology since I was in the CA legislature &amp; most recently in introducing the Modernizing Firearms Technology Act and experts agree the technology is ready.
RepDeSaulnier,Far too many Americans die every day from shootings that could have been prevented by smart guns – guns that use technology so they can only be used by specific people. http
RepDeSaulnier,As we head into Memorial Day Weekend I wanted to share my thoughts on this important holiday &amp; how we will be celebrating our servicemembers in Contra Costa. Also tune in to hear a brief update on last week’s work here in the district. Hope you have a safe &amp; happy Memorial Day! http
RepDeSaulnier,Experts advise that we can cut gun deaths by a third by implementing commonsense safety reforms like closing the background check loophole. We must listen. @user
RepDeSaulnier,Gun violence is a public health issue and should be treated as such. Using evidence-based research to make meaningful reform is how we have responded to other public health and consumer safety issues like auto safety. https://t.co/4bjMLC0eSe
RepDeSaulnier,ICYMI: Because of evidence-based gun safety laws our state has passed mass shootings are far less likely to happen in California. We must enact these reforms nationally so no community experiences the kind of heartbreak we saw in Uvalde. @user
RepDeSaulnier,Future Build provides critical job training and helps connect workers with jobs in the energy and construction fields. We were proud to celebrate this year’s group of graduates in Pittsburg and wish them the best as the enter the workforce. http
RepDeSaulnier,As a member of @user I'm committed to bringing the lessons we've learned in California to the national stage. Following the shooting in Uvalde I'm writing a bill to ensure @user can share info on best practices across the U.S. to prevent gun violence in schools.
RepDeSaulnier,We cannot wait to act on gun safety reform. While I will continue to work in Congress to pass the commonsense bills that are proven to prevent gun violence today I called on @user to do everything in @user power to protect our students. http
RepDeSaulnier,On the heels of yet another mass shooting I joined @user of @user to discuss the epidemic of gun violence unique to this country and what we must do to end it and protect our children and all Americans. http
RepDeSaulnier,My thoughts on the horrific shooting in Uvalde the 212th mass shooting of 2022 and the urgent need for Senate Republicans to stand up to the @user and do the right thing to protect our children by passing commonsense gun safety laws. http
