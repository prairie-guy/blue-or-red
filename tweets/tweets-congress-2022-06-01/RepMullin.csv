RepMullin,Huge congrats to the Rogers State University softball team for making history! https://t.co/YHcYXAplsN
RepMullin,In Oklahoma out-of-stock rates for baby formula have spiked to 77%.Despite @user sounding the alarm in February @user failed to act before it was too late. We must pass the Babies Need More Formula Now Act to ensure our families have the resources to feed their children.
RepMullin,I'm proud to join @user on this bill. The unprecedented leak of the draft Dobbs v. Jackson was an attack on democracy and we must fight to never have this type of obstruction to the rule of law happen again. http
RepMullin,Today we reflect and pay our deepest respects to the fallen heroes who gave their life in sacrifice to our great nation. There's no more noble cause than risking your life to defend the people and the virtues you hold dear. God bless our troops &amp; the loved ones they left behind. http
RepMullin,Thank you to Tulsaâ€™s VFW Post 577 for having me this afternoon for their Field of Heroes event. God bless the troops who laid down their life for our country and the loved ones they left behind. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ http
RepMullin,Last August the @user willingly left Americans behind in Afghanistan. Now it should come as no surprise theyâ€™re willing to leave behind SIVs too. The complete disregard this admin has for what we did in Afghanistan and the lack of accountability we've seen is inexcusable. http
RepMullin,As families prepare to travel for the long weekend it's no secret they'll be met with record-high prices at the pump.Two years ago today the average price of gas was $1.96 per gallon. Now it is $4.60. This is the expensive price to pay for Biden's assault on American energy.
RepMullin,Memorial Day marks the beginning of summer for Oklahomans. While we are celebrating we must not forget the true reason for Memorial Day and the families who have lost loved ones.Read more here: https://t.co/ZU3f5pIuxA
RepMullin,Though a Federal Court blocked the appeal of Title 42 @user cannot use it as an excuse to stay silent on his #BidenBorderCrisis. I sent a follow up letter for answers on how the admin plans to deal with the extreme influx of migrants once this measure is lifted. http
RepMullin,I'm proud to sign on to this letter and stand up to the bureaucrats in Washington who are crippling our local farmers with additional regulation. The @user should abandon this proposed rule immediately and allow our farmers to do their jobs without burdensome red tape. http
