RepBice,The baby formula shortage crisis is still very real for Oklahomans and families across the country. It's critical that we pass @user @user @user and my bill the Babies Need Formula Now Act to effectively address the root cause of this dire issue.
RepBice,Today we remember those who gave the ultimate sacrifice in the service of our nation. We will never forget their valor selflessness and their true embodiment of an American hero. I pray for the families and dear friends who tragically lost their loved ones in the line of duty. http
