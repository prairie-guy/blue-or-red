LeaderHoyer,Congratulations to @user on an outstanding record-making game yesterday and for winning the 2022 NCAA National Championship! I join other Marylanders and fellow Terps in celebrating your victory and wish you great success ahead. üê¢ üèÜ http
LeaderHoyer,At a time when forces of tyranny are once again threatening those who cherish freedom throughout the world let us take this day to recommit ourselves to the principles of liberty truth equality and democracy for which our heroes paid the ultimate price.
LeaderHoyer,This #MemorialDay I join my fellow Americans in honoring the sacrifice of the valiant American forces who have fought and died to defend the freedom security and human dignity of others. http http
LeaderHoyer,I congratulate Liliana McGee the winner of this year‚Äôs annual Congressional Art Competition from #MD05. Her work will be viewed by visitors of the Capitol from across the country and represent the gifted talent of students in our district.https://t.co/x2Ji9mPPnu http
LeaderHoyer,Happy birthday to the Chair of @user @user I will miss you in Congress next year.
LeaderHoyer,Wishing a happy birthday to my friend @user from #VA10. Thank you for your work to build better lives for working families in America through your roles on @user and @user
LeaderHoyer,Happy birthday to my good friend @user who has been instrumental in addressing the maternal mortality crisis as Co-Founder of the @user I‚Äôm grateful for your leadership as Chair of the @user
LeaderHoyer,Our veterans are our heroes and they deserve quality care. That is why I joined in applauding legislation to strengthen the delivery of health care and provide much-needed upgrades to the current Community Based Outpatient Clinic in Prince George‚Äôs County. http
LeaderHoyer,House Democrats are working to #ProtectRoe and will not stand idly by as Republican-led state legislatures trample on settled precedent and constitutional rights.
LeaderHoyer,This restrictive bill signed by Gov. Stitt that will ban nearly all abortions in OK is a shameful attack on women‚Äôs freedom to make her own health care decisions. Women &amp; their doctors should be making choices about their reproductive care not the govt. http
LeaderHoyer,Wishing a happy birthday to my friend @user from #IL09. Thank you for your service to our Caucus as Senior Chief Deputy Whip and your advocacy on behalf of America‚Äôs seniors as Co-Founder and Co-Chair of the Task Force on Aging and Families.
LeaderHoyer,I spoke this week on the tragic mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde Texas. Prayers and moments of silence are appropriate but they are not enough: Congress has a responsibility to the people of this country to try to prevent tragedies. http
LeaderHoyer,"I‚Äôm proud House Dems passed the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act. We recognize that violence is not ""legitimate political discourse."" We understand that having law and order means protecting the Constitution and ensuring ours is a republic of laws not terror of arms or threats."
LeaderHoyer,While our nation is still grieving from violent domestic terror attacks Senate Republicans undermined our public safety by refusing to consider Democratic-led legislation to strengthen law enforcement‚Äôs hand in keeping Americans safe from these threats. http
LeaderHoyer,How many more times must families and communities experience gun violence in America? After the unspeakable tragedy in Uvalde Texas Senate Republicans should join with Democrats to pass common-sense legislation supported by a majority of Americans to #StopGunViolence. http
LeaderHoyer,This report also shows that the next generation may not have the resources to weather similar crises unless long-term fiscal sustainability is prioritized. I hope it provides a renewed urgency to consider the implications of our decision-making as we work to govern #ForThePeople.
LeaderHoyer,Today's Budget and Economic Outlook report from @user shows the great progress we've made in our economic recovery from the pandemic with the deficit projected to fall by more than $1.7 trillion a nearly two-thirds decline. http
LeaderHoyer,I hope this letter provides Members with clarity about firearm policies so that no one is under the impression that loaded firearms can be carried around the complex. I look forward to working with Sergeant Walker &amp; the @user Board to keep everyone as safe as possible.
LeaderHoyer,Today I received a letter from @user William J. Walker concerning my inquiry into firearms on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol complex. I'm glad he said unequivocally that dangerous loaded firearms should have no place in the Capitol complex. http
LeaderHoyer,"Gun violence is a public health epidemic. I will continue to urge Senate Republicans to vote for House-passed legislation to #StopGunViolence and I will bring ""Red Flag"" legislation to the Floor during the June work period. We must act swiftly to prevent another tragedy."
LeaderHoyer,Congress must do more to #EndGunViolence. During the first week of the June work period I will bring @user bill to the Floor to establish a national ‚ÄúRed Flag‚Äù law to prevent those who pose a threat to themselves or others from being able to legally possess a firearm.
LeaderHoyer,These federal dollars will help upgrade and modernize our public transit make commutes more convenient for riders and also strengthen access to our local economy and help more families and businesses make it in Maryland.
LeaderHoyer,I was glad to stand with my colleagues to highlight the $5 million in funding to develop the Southern Maryland Rapid Transit system and bridge communities between Charles County and Prince George‚Äôs County. http http
