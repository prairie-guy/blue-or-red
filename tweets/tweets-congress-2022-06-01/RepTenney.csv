RepTenney,Did you catch Joe Biden’s @user op-Ed this weekend? Instead of offering real solutions to address the inflation crisis President Biden once again tries to deflect blame for his failed policies.Americans need solutions not more excuses Mr. President.

RepTenney,Biden’s reported plans to “cancel” $10k in student debt for individuals making up to $150k is a slap in the face to hardworking NYers who saved up worked hard to pay off their debt or chose not to go to college and it does nothing to address skyrocketing tuition.

RepTenney,Last year Biden flew illegal immigrants into New York in the dead of night without any oversight or transparency. That's why I’m a cosponsor of the Immigration Transparency and Transit Notification Act--to ensure the American people know what's going on in their own backyard!

RepTenney,The Biden Admin tried to end Title 42 this week without any comprehensive plan in place to secure the border or manage the expected surge of migrants at the border.I cosponsored legislation to fix the issue. It’s time for @user to bring it up for a vote! http
