RepValDemings,Attention Florida: as we enter hurricane season please make sure you are prepared. For helpful planning and safety tips please visit http
RepValDemings,Today is the first day of #Pride2022. I want everyone to remember that love is a gift and one of life‚Äôs most beautiful blessings. I hope you know how deeply you are loved just for being exactly who you are. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
RepValDemings,A thriving economy can only be so if it works for all people.
RepValDemings,Mental health resources are extremely important as we work to protect the American Dream for all. Let‚Äôs expand support for these critical programs. #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth
RepValDemings,Today we honored those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our Freedom. http
RepValDemings,Empowering law enforcement officers to investigate domestic terror threats will keep communities safe.
RepValDemings,For a while now our morning local and state news headlines have been ‚ÄúFlorida sets new gas price record.‚Äù It‚Äôs unacceptable and we‚Äôve taken steps today to combat price gouging and bring down gas costs.
RepValDemings,For our freedom. For our republic. For our inalienable rights. For making the ultimate sacrifice. We honor you today. #MemorialDay
RepValDemings,Take time to care for your health and your body. This has no age limit and there are so many activities for seniors. Whatever your age and ability level stay active and take care of yourself. #SeniorHealth #SeniorFitness http
RepValDemings,We've heard many arguments distractions lies evasions and other foolishness from politicians obsessed with what women do in private. My rebuttal is this: they want a national ban on abortion. They want to punish women. They want to put doctors in jail.
RepValDemings,Price gouging and market manipulation - especially during a global health and economic crisis - is simply shameful.
RepValDemings,Remembering today Deputy John Creegan of the Orange County Sheriff's Office. Killed on this day 26 years ago in the line of duty. Gone but not forgotten.
RepValDemings,If you work hard and follow the rules you should be able to pursue the American Dream.
RepValDemings,The safety of our communities depends on law enforcement partnerships that are critical to preventing domestic terrorism and violent extremism. The House has passed legislation I cosponsored to monitor investigate and prosecute cases of domestic terrorism. The Senate must act.
RepValDemings,As the daughter of a maid and a janitor I watched my parents budget and save every penny. The Senate needs to take up our legislation to bring down the cost of health care and gas.
RepValDemings,Senate Republicans should join us to lower your medicine prices.
RepValDemings,We must stand strong against violent extremism like the Buffalo shooter. That‚Äôs why last week the House passed the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act. Those obstructing our bill in the Senate must get out of the way and let us protect the American people.
RepValDemings,I will always fight for a future where Florida‚Äôs women are treated as fully equal citizens where they‚Äînot any politician‚Äîhave the freedom to control their own body life and future.
RepValDemings,Gas prices are still too high. The Senate must act quickly and pass our legislation from the House to stop price gouging.
RepValDemings,With costs high as they are even good-paying jobs are sometimes not enough to make ends meet. Fair housing costs must be prioritized in Central Florida. I am working to bring down costs for families.
RepValDemings,Gun violence is the leading cause of death for children in America.
RepValDemings,I trust America‚Äôs women to make the best decisions for themselves and their families. #DefendRoe
RepValDemings,It has been 10 years since Sandy Hook and zero meaningful gun safety bills have passed the Senate.
RepValDemings,We cannot tolerate uncompetitive markets where profits come at the expense of Florida families.
RepValDemings,Housing costs are out of control in Florida and rent is going up by hundreds of dollars. This is unsustainable. As the daughter of a maid and a janitor I believe if you work hard and play by the rules you should be able to find safe reliable housing in our community.
RepValDemings,Please join me in congratulating the people of Guyana on their 56th anniversary of Independence. The US maintains strong partnership with Guyana and worked closely during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide vaccines to the Guyanese people. I look forward to our future partnership.
RepValDemings,I cofounded the Haiti Caucus in Congress because Haitian Americans are a big part of what makes Florida special. We will continue to fight for stability security and democracy in Haiti and for the American Dream for all Haitian Americans. Happy #HaitianHeritageMonth.
RepValDemings,As a former police chief missing children and related cases are among the most painful and devastating to work on. Parents please talk to your children about kidnapping safety and build a plan together. #NationalMissingChildrensDay
