RepRonnyJackson,Joe Biden is breaking records but not in a good way. Gas prices are at an all-time high! Depleting our Strategic Petroleum Reserve is wrong and won't fix things but unleashing American energy production WILL!
RepRonnyJackson,This #MemorialDay2022 we pay tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect the freedoms we hold dear in this country. Weâ€™ll NEVER forget the true cost of freedom!
