SenFeinstein,Wishing everyone a safe and happy #Pride! During Pride Month let’s celebrate the great progress made in the fight for equality since Stonewall but also recognize that the fight for equality doesn’t stop. http
SenFeinstein,California is the country’s largest economy and drives economic success across the nation but we can’t keep up that role without functioning roads and railways. These grants will help improve our infrastructure and create new jobs a win-win proposition.https://t.co/0MOqWyjYAB
SenFeinstein,#MemorialDay is an opportunity to remember and thank those who paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedom. We’re forever grateful for the brave service members of the United States armed forces.
SenFeinstein,VA national cemeteries across the country are reopening to the public for Memorial Day ceremonies for the first time in two years. Find a list of ceremonies and more information on Memorial Day here:https://t.co/OHIEthTgok
SenFeinstein,Last night the Senate passed our resolution honoring the life and legacy of Secretary Norman Mineta. He was a remarkable leader a good friend and his experience and expertise will be deeply missed.
SenFeinstein,In just two mass shootings 31 people were murdered – 19 of them children. All because our nation’s gun laws are fundamentally broken. If we can’t trust an 18-year-old to buy a beer it defies logic that we would allow them to buy weapons of war. We must pass the Age 21 Act now.
SenFeinstein,Wildfire season is well underway in California and the federal government must ensure the West has adequate resources. I joined two bills introduced by @user to help prepare for and respond to wildfires.https://t.co/VzwrlTZzrQ
SenFeinstein,The @user offers some of our best and brightest minds the opportunity to serve their country and the world. I’m proud to again lead efforts to ensure the Peace Corps receives sufficient funding to enable great work around the globe.https://t.co/jR87q4KLG9
SenFeinstein,Laguna Honda Hospital treats hundreds of San Franciscans many of whom have complex medical needs and rely on its health care services. At such a critical time when COVID-19 cases are rising in California we can’t let this hospital be shuttered. http
SenFeinstein,The shooters in both Texas and New York weren’t old enough to buy a beer but they were able to buy an assault weapon. I spoke with Steven Dettelbach President Biden’s nominee to lead the ATF about the need to curb gun violence in the United States. http
