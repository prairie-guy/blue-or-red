RepRalphNorman,A couple highlights from this weekend's Memorial Day ceremonies in York Tega Cay and Chester. May we never forget that our freedom was paid for by the sacrifices of so many. http
RepRalphNorman,We think of most holidays as times of celebration but this one is not.Memorial Day is a day of reverence. It's a day of honor and respect. It's a day we reflect and pay tribute those who have laid down their lives in service to this great nation. http
