RepJeffDuncan,Joe Biden is a record-setting president (in all the wrong ways). This is #JoeBidensAmerica https://t.co/aRK0tTnqWh
RepJeffDuncan,"If @user actually wanted gas prices to go down ""understanding that feeling personally"" just isn't going to cut it. Unleash domestic energy production and end your war on American energy Mr. President. http"
RepJeffDuncan,"We're in the middle of a labor shortage not ""one of the strongest job markets."" And if @user actually wants to ""address inflation"" instead of just blaming it on something else he should start with restraining his reckless federal spending that fuels record-high costs. http"
RepJeffDuncan,"Biden now claims there's ""no rational basis"" for 9mm handguns as Trudeau announces a bill to freeze handgun ownership in Canada. @user the 2nd Amendment is absolutely ""absolute"" &amp; I'll continue standing up against these tyrants who are attempting to unarm law-abiding citizens."
RepJeffDuncan,Our oil reserves are at the lowest level in decades because @user tried to combat his #EnergyCrisis by tapping the SPR reserved for natural disasters/times of war. Biden's reckless move to boost political capital threatens our national security/stability. http
RepJeffDuncan,The national gas average is now $4.62. In a country blessed with abundant natural resources this should never be a reality. @user it is time to unleash domestic energy production. Americans cannot afford these historic back-breaking prices at the pump. ‚õΩÔ∏è
RepJeffDuncan,Remembering and honoring our fallen American heroes this Memorial Day. The brave men and women who lost their lives in defense of freedom deserve our deepest gratitude and respect. Thank you and God Bless our troops. üá∫üá∏ http
RepJeffDuncan,Gas prices today in Anderson. Make no mistake ‚Äî these gas prices are the direct result of @user war on American energy. We won‚Äôt stop fighting for energy independence &amp; unleashing domestic production. Americans want no part in Biden &amp; the radical Left‚Äôs ‚Äúincredible transition.‚Äù http
RepJeffDuncan,#Bidenflation continues to fuel surging costs from the gas pump to the grocery store due to the Democrats' inflationary spending &amp; energy dependence. Some are having to choose between buying gas or groceries. Americans cannot afford a Joe Biden presidency. http
RepJeffDuncan,Important new details on the tragedy in Texas. http
RepJeffDuncan,"The Biden Admin says ""do not come"" to the southern border but their open-border policies say the exact opposite. Every state's now a border state because of Biden's policies &amp; refusal to respond to the crisis his policies caused. http"
RepJeffDuncan,On 1/19/21 a day before inauguration the national gas price average was $2.38 (AAA). The next day @user essentially canceled US energy causing prices to surge to historic levels we now face. We're 491 days into Biden's presidency &amp; he owns this #EnergyCrisis. #BidenPriceHike
RepJeffDuncan,Our hearts are broken as we pray for the families of the murdered school children &amp; teachers in Uvalde Texas. My hope and prayer is that the God of all hope comforts you in these troubled times &amp; that He gives hope &amp; comfort to all those who are grieving this unthinkable tragedy
