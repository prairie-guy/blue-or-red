RepShontelBrown,Honored to welcome Dr. Sara Bleich the Director of Nutrition Security and Health Equity at @user to Cleveland today.At the @user we discussed how Congress and the Administration can work to better support our food banks. http
RepShontelBrown,Spending the afternoon learning more about the great work @user is doing to feed our friends and neighbors in Northeast Ohio.Through a new partnership with @user the food bank is delivering fresh produce and shelf-stable food directly to local seniors. http
RepShontelBrown,On this day 101 years ago a violent white mob attacked Black residents in Tulsa's Greenwood district and burned their homes and businesses.Understanding the full truth about our past—including this dark chapter—is critical to addressing injustices that persist today.
RepShontelBrown,Today we offer our immense gratitude to the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice while fighting to secure our freedoms. We owe them all and their families much more than we can ever repay.
RepShontelBrown,About to join @user Tune in now! http
RepShontelBrown,New funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is headed to Ohio to clean up orphaned oil and gas wells in @user will not only create new jobs but also protect the health of our Cleveland community.https://t.co/l2rkJu5gwZ
RepShontelBrown,Days after I was sworn into Congress I signed on to a bill to ban assault weapons.Why?Because no American needs an AR-15 or a high capacity magazine.
RepShontelBrown,I strive to focus on the positive and what we can get done together.But in this moment let's not mince words.It is Republicans who are blocking commonsense gun reform.Stalling a Domestic Terror bill.Seeking to overturn Roe.And obstructing voting rights legislation.
RepShontelBrown,Today two years after the murder of George Floyd @user is delivering on the promise of meaningful police reform.This historic order takes key steps that will improve the safety of our communities and restore trust between police and the people they were sworn to protect. http
