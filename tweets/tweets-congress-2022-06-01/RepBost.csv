RepBost,As #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth comes to a close I visited Centerstone in Carbondale to discuss ways we can work together to address this crisis. It is critical that folks can get the help they need especially in rural areas where there are fewer mental health providers. http
RepBost,I was honored to speak at the Coulterville Memorial Day ceremony yesterday to pay tribute to the generations of men and women who have laid down their lives in defense of our nation. We can never truly thank them enough for the their service and their sacrifice. http
RepBost,I recently visited the United Association of Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters Local 101 Training Facility in Belleville &amp; met with UA leaders from throughout our district. We discussed their efforts to connect veterans with training &amp; apprenticeships as they transition out of the military. http
RepBost,On #MemorialDay we honor the men &amp; women who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our nation. As you spend time with family &amp; friends please take a moment to remember the true purpose of this sacred day &amp; spare a thought for the fallen heroes who are no longer with us. http
