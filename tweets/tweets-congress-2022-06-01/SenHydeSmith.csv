SenHydeSmith,Steady and projected growth of Brandon and Rankin County requires important infrastructure improvements.  $1.5M from @user will help to expand rail and traffic capacity while boosting safety in a significant way. Details:
SenHydeSmith,Many Mississippians are vexed that Congress can‚Äôt act to stop some of the egregious decisions coming out of the @user particularly in terms of the pandemic &amp; abortion. The Senate should have a role in determining whether our nation must be subjected to its biased actions.
SenHydeSmith,"We set aside today to remember honor and celebrate our nation's lost heroes. We must also do the same for their loved ones for whom every day is #MemorialDay. To all Mississippians and Americans who have served ""thank you"" does not begin to cover it. #MemorialDay2022 http"
SenHydeSmith,"‚ÄúPraise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort who comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God."" 2 Corinthians 1:3-4"
SenHydeSmith,Another great visit earlier this week with @user Can't thank them enough for their work to provide care for Mississippians through the pandemic and beyond. http
SenHydeSmith,Had great discussion with @user to address important transportation projects and to hear about the city's priorities as we gear up for FY23 appropriations. http
SenHydeSmith,Heading into #MemorialDayWeekend let‚Äôs remember it's because of those who gave everything &amp; asked for nothing that we may enjoy our liberties freedoms and values. I will continue to do all I can to fulfill my obligation to support our military &amp; veterans. God bless America! üá∫üá∏
SenHydeSmith,I'll be cheering on @user as they begin their #SuperRegionalWeekend! They face Arizona today at 11:00am CT! #HAILSTATE üê∂ http
SenHydeSmith,It's sad that as families get ready to celebrate #MemorialDayWeekend it'll cost them much more this year to fill up the tank or to buy supplies to grill out. Meanwhile @user sits on his hands doing nothing about #bidenflation - unless it's pointing a finger at someone else... http
SenHydeSmith,Ending promising military careers based on a COVID Vaccine seems punitive &amp; another example of government overreach. The cadets &amp; midshipmen at our service academies shouldn‚Äôt be dismissed so flippantly. @user bill would protect these young men &amp; women from such.
