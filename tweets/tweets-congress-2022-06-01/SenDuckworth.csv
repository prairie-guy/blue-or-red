SenDuckworth,NEWS: In light of China's recent provocation I introduced a bipartisan bill to help Taiwan develop its military defenses and provide it with the tools it needs to protect itself from any unwarranted attack. I remain committed to supporting this important strategic partner.
SenDuckworth,This Memorial Day I hope you will join me in not just thinking of all those warriors who sacrificed for the nation they loved but to honor the sacrifices of our fallen heroes by acting in service of others. http
SenDuckworth,It is long past time we hold the makers of AR-15s and weapons of war accountable.We need to eliminate liability shields for manufacturers and the FTC needs to launch an investigation into their aggressive marketing so we can protect our kids and prevent future tragedies.
SenDuckworth,Just days before the Uvalde massacre the manufacturer of the 18-year-old shooter‚Äôs weapon of choice literally posted an ad of a child holding an AR-15. That‚Äôs not a coincidence.The firearm industry is purposefully marketing to the next teen shooter.https://t.co/pUaQLVzvWI
SenDuckworth,Suspend the filibuster to pass commonsense gun safety reforms. Time and again we've done it on things that matter.But the right of our babies to not be torn apart by weapons of war is not worthy of that? http
SenDuckworth,Let's show the nation that we value children's lives more than an arcane Senate procedure rule.Let's do what adults are supposed to do: let's protect our kids.Let's do our jobs.

SenDuckworth,A thread: Every single one of these heart-wrenching stories is preventable. We don't have to live like this.Senate Republicans when will it be enough?https://t.co/Ok3cIii2se
SenDuckworth,Republicans care more about a pay day from the gun lobby than they do dead babies. Enough. http
SenDuckworth,When the assault weapons ban was allowed to expire the number of mass shooting deaths tripled‚Äîtripled.We know that the ban works and we need to reinstate it.
SenDuckworth,NEWS: After passing the House last week Senator Cornyn and my bipartisan Public Safety Officer Support Act swiftly passed out of @user us closer to providing so many grieving families with the acknowledgement and support they need after such tragic losses.
SenDuckworth,Climate change threatens our national security our troops' safety and military readiness. Today I'm proud to introduce a bill to help @user transition to clean energy by giving it the tools it needs to meet its energy resilience goals. http
SenDuckworth,I wish I didn't have places to buy ballistic protective backpacks for my daughters bookmarked but I do.Losing your child is a hell I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.And we know how to stop these attacks‚Äîheck the rest of the world has.Suspend the filibuster for our babies.
SenDuckworth,Buffalo.El Paso.Pittsburgh.White supremacists and other domestic extremists have terrorized far too many communities.By blocking the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act Republicans are doing nothing to stop future tragedies committed by radicalized home-grown terrorists.
SenDuckworth,NEWS: @user Chair Khan is swiftly taking action after I called for a wide-ranging inquiry into the infant formula industry. I was glad to speak to her this week and look forward to reviewing the findings so we can develop legislative fixes to help ensure this doesn't happen again. http
SenDuckworth,"Let's be clear: you are not ""pro-life"" if you choose to do *absolutely nothing* to save children from gun violence save Black and Brown moms from the maternal mortality crisis and save Americans from domestic terrorism or ANY OTHER FORM of preventable crises."
SenDuckworth,I ask my Republican colleagues when will children's lives matter more than your check from the gun lobby? When? http
SenDuckworth,Black lives matter. Now and always.It's long past time we pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to help uproot systemic racism prevent future tragedies and truly bring us closer to equal protection under the law for all Americans.
SenDuckworth,George Floyd‚Äôs death was a tragedy‚Äîbut horrifyingly it's not an anomaly.It‚Äôs on each of us lucky enough to still be here today to use every breath we have to bring about the justice he was robbed of two years ago‚Äîand to ensure that no one else is robbed of that justice again.
SenDuckworth,On this day two years ago George Floyd was murdered by a police officer who had taken the oath to protect and serve.For about nine minutes‚Äîa father a son a brother was forced to beg for his life until he couldn‚Äôt beg any longer. http
SenDuckworth,In the face of yet another moment of unimaginable grief it is time the Senate shows the nation that we value children‚Äôs lives more than an arcane procedural rule. It is time to do our jobs and act to protect our children from senseless gun violence. http
SenDuckworth,If ‚Äúthe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun‚Äù then how did yesterday happen?We can do better‚Äîfor our kids and our country.
SenDuckworth,"19 children and 2 teachers. Nearly a decade after 26 were killed at Sandy Hook.Nowhere else in the world are families forced to face this kind of loss in the name in ""freedom.""How many more kids will get gunned down before Republicans act?Enough. We can prevent this."
