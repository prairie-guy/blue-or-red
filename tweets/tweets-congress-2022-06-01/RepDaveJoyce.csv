RepDaveJoyce,While I hope you're having a fun and safe #MemorialDay weekend spent with family and friends please be sure to take the time to honor those who have served our great country and made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ we owe them an infinite debt. http
RepDaveJoyce,Those of us in elected office must funnel our outrage and grief over the gut-wrenching loss of young innocent life in Uvalde into a collective determination to craft bipartisan solutions that prevent these tragedies from becoming an everyday reality.
RepDaveJoyce,It is critical that we assemble a rational group of serious legislators who understand that we can and must strike the balance between protecting law-abiding Americans' constitutional rights and preserving the safety of our communities and our children.
RepDaveJoyce,As the only Member of Congress to have prosecuted a school shooter I wrote to @user today in the wake of the merciless violence in Uvalde TX to offer my assistance in developing bipartisan solutions to protect our nationâ€™s children from these unspeakable tragedies. http
RepDaveJoyce,School shootings are the most incomprehensible form of evil. Unfortunately it's an evil I am acutely familiar with. It's the same sick wickedness I saw in the eyes of T.J. Lane in 2012 after he shot and killed 3 of his classmates at Chardon High School and wounded 3 others.
