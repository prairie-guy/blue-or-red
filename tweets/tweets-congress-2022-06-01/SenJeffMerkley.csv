SenJeffMerkley,Passing the DISCLOSE Act and getting dark money out of politics is a huge step toward making the kind of progress that we need to make. We’re fighting to get it done.
SenJeffMerkley,.@SenWhitehouse is right. The immense clout of the NRA’s dark money operation—the money they pour into our elections and into the campaign coffers of politicians—is a corrupting influence that stalls badly needed legislation like gun safety reforms. http
SenJeffMerkley,I support the bipartisan efforts to pass comprehensive gun safety reform and send it to the President’s desk. And I’ll continue to work to reform the filibuster so we can make the bold reforms necessary to keep our communities and our country safer.
SenJeffMerkley,Everyone should be able to move about their communities safely without fear of gun violence. Parents shouldn’t need to worry when they drop their kids off at school. Failure isn’t an option on gun safety reforms. This shouldn’t be partisan—lives are at stake.
SenJeffMerkley,June is Gun Violence Awareness Month something I know has been top of mind for many across the country. How could it not be? We live in a county where mass shootings are a weekly occurrence and where active shooter drills are necessary in our kids’ classrooms.
SenJeffMerkley,If we’re serious about tackling climate chaos we need to get serious about breaking our reliance on fossil fuels. That means passing my #KeepItInTheGround Act ending Big Oil’s destruction of our home and transitioning to renewable energy. http
SenJeffMerkley,Earlier this year I was on the Senate floor explaining the filibuster and how it stalls progress on protecting our freedom to vote. The same thing is happening with gun safety reforms—we must reform the filibuster and make the Senate work for the people.https://t.co/vNi2VdZAi2
SenJeffMerkley,We need to do more to support the folks who work tirelessly to keep our communities safer and healthier. They’re invaluable to our communities. I have a bill to modernize nursing education and infrastructure and enhance our preparedness—I’m working to get it passed.
SenJeffMerkley,Health care workers make our communities better one bedside as a time. The past few years have been full of unprecedented challenges for health care workers as they navigated a pandemic that has killed more than 1 million Americans. http
SenJeffMerkley,Today we remember all those who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedom. We hold in our hearts the loved ones of members of our armed forces who lost their lives in the line of duty. Thank you for your service. #MemorialDay
SenJeffMerkley,We should all be able to go to the grocery store attend school and walk around our neighborhoods without fear of being shot. The epidemic of gun violence in our nation makes that impossible—we need to reform the filibuster and pass gun safety legislation. Now.
SenJeffMerkley,This #WorldHungerDay is a chance to reaffirm our commitment to addressing food insecurity and famine wherever it arises and condemning the weaponization of hunger. http
SenJeffMerkley,I keep thinking about taking my son to his first day of first grade at his school down the street. No parent should have to fear for their child’s safety after they drop them off at school. All we have to do is think about our own children and we feel it.
SenJeffMerkley,It is the Senate’s responsibility to address the issues affecting America’s families—and gun violence certainly impacts our families. We need more than thoughts and prayers. We need to reform the filibuster and make substantive legislative change.
SenJeffMerkley,As the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. prepares to take office in the Philippines @user and I led our Senate colleagues in urging @user to prioritize protecting democracy and human rights in the U.S.-Philippines relationship. http
SenJeffMerkley,.@Rep_Stansbury and I led 81 colleagues to urge @user to engage in urgent diplomacy to prevent the eviction of Palestinians from homes they've lived in for generations in Masafer Yatta. These evictions increase tension &amp; undercut efforts to take concrete steps toward peace. http
SenJeffMerkley,To address gun safety we need to address the fact that the Senate is a broken institution where a minority of Senators can stall progress. I’m working to reform the filibuster so we can pass commonsense gun safety reforms and get them to President Biden’s desk.
SenJeffMerkley,Read the full resolution here ⬇️ http
SenJeffMerkley,Starvation should never be used as a weapon of war. My Senate colleagues and I introduced a resolution calling on the Biden Admin. to condemn the weaponization of hunger in places like Ukraine and Ethiopia and focus humanitarian efforts on addressing food insecurity and famine. http
SenJeffMerkley,We need to go further and implement these changes at the local level. We need to pass the Justice in Policing Act in the Senate and send it to the President’s desk. Senate procedure should not stand in the way of progress toward justice—reform the filibuster and get it done.
SenJeffMerkley,I’m particularly glad to see the registry on the list of potential reforms. We have to make sure it’s implemented well and actually used by police departments. There’s no excuse for shuffling cops who abuse their badge to other police departments but it happens all the time.
SenJeffMerkley,Ending the use of chokeholds and no-knock warrants and creating a national registry for officers fired for misconduct would be a step toward reforming our broken policing system reckoning with its racist origins and pursuing accountability.https://t.co/Bi7OtnKZz9
SenJeffMerkley,It’s not enough to just say that Black Lives Matter. I will not give up on working to make sure that fundamental truth is reflected in our laws and policies by passing meaningful police reform and rooting policy in equity and justice.
SenJeffMerkley,George Floyd should still be alive today. I am thinking of his loved ones—his daughter who has spent two years now without her father and all of the friends and family who loved him. All those grappling with anger trauma and grief in the wake of his murder.
SenJeffMerkley,As we reflect on George Floyd's life—on all the lives cut short and families torn apart by police brutality—we recognize that racism has been with us since the beginning in this country and the fight for justice for Black Americans is a constant effort that requires all of us. http
