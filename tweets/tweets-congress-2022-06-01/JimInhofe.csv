JimInhofe,As a senior member and former chairman of the @user I understand the vital need to improve our roads bridges and infrastructure to connect communities empower economic productivity and create jobs across America.Read my thoughts here ⬇https://t.co/bQE6q2IJQ5
JimInhofe,Don't forget ▶ The @user Aviation Education Grant Program applications are due today! If you have not already submit your application here: https://t.co/NEgsm1egJh
JimInhofe,"How many times have admin officials had to ""clarify"" @user policies? Just like Obama-Biden admin refusing to send Javelins to Ukraine we see flip flopping on sending long-range rocket systems bc they fear they're too ""provocative."" Indecision &amp; appeasement only empower Putin. http"
JimInhofe,As we mark this #MemorialDay I want to express my gratitude for all of the men and women who have laid down their lives in service to our country. Our service members put their lives on the line every day to protect our God-given freedoms. God bless them and their families. http
JimInhofe,We cannot afford to keep dragging our feet because Biden officials’ instincts are to appease Putin rather than deter him. This administration has said Ukraine can win this fight — they need to stop getting in the way of victory.
JimInhofe,Though the Biden administration eventually did the right thing it was only after precious time was wasted and under immense pressure from Congress Ukraine and our allies and partners supporting this cause.
JimInhofe,Remember the Biden administration initially held up delivery of Stingers and artillery for the same reason both of which have proven invaluable to keeping the Ukrainians in the fight.
JimInhofe,For the rocket systems in particular I sure hope the reporting is correct that Biden admin officials have lifted their hold because it’s been the #1 thing the Ukrainians have requested for over a month. These systems are desperately needed on the battlefield in the Donbas.
JimInhofe,I hope the White House doesn’t keep blocking new key weapons like multiple launch rocket systems main battle tanks and advanced drones from being part of any new Ukraine aid package because they believe they’re too “provocative.”
JimInhofe,Because of the Biden admin's rushed &amp; haphazard process Afghan evacuees were not vetted using all of the tools &amp; data available to DOD.@ChuckGrassley @user &amp; I are asking @user for an update on how they are fixing this problem.More ↓https://t.co/OTMoYAmspb
JimInhofe,We face the worst border crisis on record because President Biden has failed to secure the border in the first place. Instead of addressing the root cause this admin wants Oklahomans to bail them out. They should reevaluate and refocus their priorities.https://t.co/rq91txEuHz
JimInhofe,I joined 81 of my Senate colleagues in sending a letter to @user urging him to swiftly advance Sweden’s and Finland’s NATO applications. Expanding NATO will send a clear message to Putin and strengthen this key transatlantic alliance. http
