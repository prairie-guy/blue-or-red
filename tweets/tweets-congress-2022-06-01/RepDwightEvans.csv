RepDwightEvans,2/ A good example of city-level action would be for #Philly to use more of its American Rescue Plan to fill police vacancies to deal with gun violence as I urged in my recent letter to @user &amp; @user http
RepDwightEvans,1/ Little action in the SENATE.The House has passed 2 gun-reform bills: HR 8 (universal background checks for gun buyers) and HR 1146 (closing the Charleston loophole). These bills would save some lives!And yes state and city-level efforts are vitally important too. http
