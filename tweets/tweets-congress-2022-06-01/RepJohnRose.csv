RepJohnRose,Incredible work going on at Racoon Mountain! I recently joined @user for a tour of their Pump Storage Facility. Water is stored here when power demand is low then released when demand is high creating more than 1600 MW of energy.That's enough to power thousands of homes! http
RepJohnRose,Inflation is an invisible tax on all Americans. It isn't something one can easily turn off but this administration could start with committing to an end to its reckless spending. Read my op-ed in @user
RepJohnRose,This #MemorialDay Chelsea and I remember the sacrifices of those who gave their full measure of devotion to our nation so that we can live freely. May God bless the families of the fallen and protect those serving our country today. http
RepJohnRose,Memorial Day weekend is the perfect time to see the new Gold Star Families Monument in Ft. Campbell. The monument honors the families of fallen servicemen and women. I will forever be grateful for their sacrifice. You can find it at 2699 Kentucky Avenue Ft. Campbell KY http
RepJohnRose,I truly believe our best days are ahead -- and I am excited to see all the contributions the Class of 2022 makes to society. Congratulations graduates! üë®‚Äçüéìüë©‚Äçüéì http
RepJohnRose,#MemorialDay weekend should be a time spent with loved ones thinking of those who sacrificed everything for our freedom. But this weekend families across the country will spend a lot of time worrying about record prices at the pump. It doesn't have to be this way. http
RepJohnRose,"""...while continuing to protect our natural resources with climate-friendly science-based smart practices. This rule could have serious unintended consequences for our family farmers by forcing them to comply with extremely burdensome regulations they cannot afford.‚Äù"
RepJohnRose,"From @user President @user on @user proposed rule: ‚ÄúWe are extremely concerned about the impact the SEC proposed rule could have on our farmers. We have never been more committed to producing a safe and affordable food supply..."" https://t.co/VQvQTwP83p"
RepJohnRose,Read my full press release here: http
RepJohnRose,ICYMI: I led a bipartisan letter with 117 Members of Congress calling on the @user to back down from implementing a rule that would devastate farmers. I don't think that bureaucrats in Washington should be telling Tennessee farmers what to do with their land. http

RepJohnRose,The SEC should listen to farmers and reverse this terrible proposal before putting our entire nationwide supply of safe and affordable food and agriculture products at risk.Thank you to the 117 Members of Congress that joined me in putting our farmers first.
RepJohnRose,That is why I led a bipartisan letter with 117 Members of Congress calling on the @user to back down from their overbearing ESG rule. http http
RepJohnRose,Requiring climate reports from farmers is ridiculous.  It will send food prices even higher as farmers will have yet another input cost - extra hands who can cover for them while they work on a meaningless report.Read more from @user
