RepRobinKelly,This week my Prevent Gun Trafficking Act willgo through @user committee markup and move one step closer to becoming law. We're going to stop the illegal flow of guns into our communities and save lives.
RepRobinKelly,This #MemorialDay we honor those who gave their lives to protect our freedom. Thank you to all our service members veterans military families and fallen soldiers for their sacrifice. http
RepRobinKelly,Today @user @user &amp; I are leading 131 Members of Congress in calling on House leadership to immediately bring pending gun violence legislation to the floor for a vote. Too many have died. We have solutions. It is time to act. http
RepRobinKelly,Gun violence leaves behind an incalculable number of victims. My heart is broken for these children.Survivors loved ones &amp; the broader community will need help navigating this trauma for many years to come. We must ensure consistent access to mental health care for everyone. http
RepRobinKelly,The majority of Americans want common sense #GunViolencePrevention laws in place because THESE LAWS WORK. Any suggestion otherwise is an untrue excuse. http
RepRobinKelly,This is great news! Extended access to postpartum care will save lives. That's why I fought to include this policy in the #AmericanRescuePlan and why I will keep fighting to make this coverage mandatory in every single state through my #MOMMAs Act. http
RepRobinKelly,We are not hopeless. We have legislation ready to move forward to stop this senseless gun violence and save lives in every community across the United States. I‚Äôm ready to get this done. Will you join me? #StopGunViolence
RepRobinKelly,There is no one solution to stop gun violence. There are many:üîêrequiring safe storage of firearms‚òéÔ∏èmaking gun owners report lost or stolen firearms within 48 hoursüö´keeping guns from high-risk individualsüóÉÔ∏èrequiring background checks for gun shows &amp; online marketplaces
RepRobinKelly,La violencia armada es la principal causa de muerte entre los ni√±os. En 2020 4357 ni√±os fueron matados a tiros. Las estad√≠sticas de violencia armada est√°n subiendo en todo el pa√≠s. Yo defender√© a los ni√±os de los Estados Unidos. http
RepRobinKelly,Millions of Americans are living with mental health issues but do not shoot people. In fact people with mental health issues are more likely to be a victim of violence than to perpetrate it. We need to pass gun violence prevention legislation to stop this madness.
RepRobinKelly,This is the most tired argument out there @user More than half the guns used in crimes in Chicago are trafficked in from other states with lax gun laws. That's why I'm working to stop gun trafficking at the federal level. http
RepRobinKelly,Mass shootings are increasing but the majority of children killed by guns are shot in smaller day-to-day incidents. I've been working on this issue since coming to Congress in 2013. We've made dreadfully little progress. It's time to pass #GunViolencePrevention legislation.
RepRobinKelly,Parkland Tops Uvalde. Todos ten√≠an seguridad o polic√≠a. No detuvo al tirador. Armar a los maestros y poner m√°s polic√≠as en las escuelas no es la respuesta. Necesitamos una legislaci√≥n para la prevenci√≥n de #gunviolence.
RepRobinKelly,I am fed up. We WILL stand up for #GunViolencePrevention. This is the leading cause of death among children and teens. I won't wait for a new Congress to move forward on gun violence prevention legislation. I'm urging my colleagues to act NOW. http
RepRobinKelly,@user @user @user @user @user @user Gun violence prevention is one of my top priorities. We can't let this go on!
