RepBowman,One of my favorite things about being an educator in Congress is visiting schools all around my district.We have such incredible youth and I am so honored to support them. http
RepBowman,With a swoop of a pen @user can provide 46 million Americans with the financial freedom they deserve.Nobody should be in debt for wanting an education.
RepBowman,How is it acceptable to choose to protect guns over the lives of our children?
RepBowman,Last week I visited Scarsdale High School to meet some of the amazing students and speak with them during a panel discussion.Our students are the future and supporting uplifting and protecting them is one of the most important things I can do while in office. http
RepBowman,Republicans are truly gutless for not passing common sense gun control.They‚Äôre letting our children die.
RepBowman,We‚Äôre going to keep organizing until we see abortion rights protected in every corner of America.We cannot force people to have birth.
RepBowman,This weekend I was able to attend many Memorial Day events around our NY-16 community to honor those we‚Äôve lost. Being with your community on days like this is so important. http
RepBowman,Hey @user canceling $10000 of student debt isn‚Äôt enough.Cancel it all.
RepBowman,With all of the trauma our kids are experiencing many do not have access to free therapy in their schools.My Green New Deal for Public Schools will work towards ensuring that every child has access to the free mental health care they need.
RepBowman,I can‚Äôt keep watching our kids get murdered.It‚Äôs preventable. All it takes is gun control.
RepBowman,The baby formula monopoly is causing our babies to go hungry. It‚Äôs unacceptable.We have to break up this monopoly built on corporate greed.
RepBowman,Today we honor all those who have lost their lives in service of our nation. To those who have lost love ones I am standing in solidarity hope you all take care of yourselves today.No one should have to lose a loved one.
RepBowman,Happy Sunday everyone! Raise your hand if you think @user should cancel student debt today ‚úãüèø
RepBowman,May is Foster Care Awareness Month and today we want to highlight a member of our community who has been through foster care Chantal Fernandez.Chantel is now working for Coalition Of Hispanic Family Services and has been an incredible community member. http
RepBowman,If 10 Republicans aren‚Äôt going to get on board with passing common sense gun control in the Senate then we need to abolish the filibuster.A procedural rule is NOT more important than our kids‚Äô lives.
RepBowman,Raj is our Senior Policy Advisor and he specializes in climate legislation. He‚Äôs a great member of our team and we could not be prouder of the work he‚Äôs done over the past few years. Check it out! http
RepBowman,On Wednesday I had the honor of attending the toping off ceremony for the Universal Hip Hop Museum @user in the #Bronx. Hip hop saved my life and I am so grateful its rich history will be preserved forever. http
RepBowman,How would @user canceling student debt help YOU?
RepBowman,We need to pass common sense gun control.For Uvalde. For Parkland. For Columbine. For Newtown. For our kids.
RepBowman,As more information comes out about the devastating massacre in Uvalde we‚Äôre seeing just how ineffective having cops in schools is.No child feels safe around a gun and having guns in our schools doesn‚Äôt even stop school shootings from occurring.
RepBowman,The last few weeks have been so taxing on everyone including myself.Please make sure you have time to rest process and reflect on what we have been experiencing as a nation. We are all hurting.
RepBowman,Unfortunately we have a system right now where that is not the case. Let us all have the courage to do what‚Äôs right so that no one dies or is unnecessarily the victim of police violence again. (7/7)
RepBowman,We need accountability and not that type where we rely on police officers to account for their own wrongs. The type that forces our criminal justice system to uphold and obey the law without snatching away people‚Äôs right to life and liberty. (6/7)
RepBowman,Also true and more nefarious is the fact that according to FBI data white nationalists sympathizers have infiltrated police departments all across the country. They continue to persecute people like me and are protected by a badge and uniform. (5/7)
RepBowman,From beginning to end the entire criminal justice system keeps rich often white people employed and making money. Our failure to pass  the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act says Black lives are not more important than the billion dollar policing and prison industry. (4/7)
RepBowman,Our failure to act is a signal to bad actors in law enforcement that murdering Black people is okay. There are too many police officers lawyers prosecutors and judges in our criminal justice system who support a system that lacks accountability. (3/7)
RepBowman,Specifically the Senate has failed to abolish the filibuster which would allow us to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. This could only happen in a country where Black lives and people of color are seen as less than. (2/7)
RepBowman,Two years after George Floyd‚Äôs death and we‚Äôve yet to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Why? Because the Senate has been allowed to sit on their hands without functioning for the American people. (1/7)
RepBowman,Join me in solidarity with the incredible Amazon workers including my brother Daniel Olayiwola.Daniel is an Amazon worker who is working to end productivity quotas and workplace surveillance and is presented his resolution to the Amazon Annual General Meeting yesterday. http
RepBowman,We have a hearing today in @user at 12pm on the FY23 budget and priorities. I‚Äôll be asking @user about student debt.You can watch here: http
RepBowman,Join myself and @user from @user now live on TikTok talking about how we can heal from the trauma we have been experiencing.We need to heal.https://t.co/5KCNGiVyLC
RepBowman,Again @user myself and the American people are pleading with you to do the bare minimum and save lives. Since I sent this letter we've lost 116 more lives to gun violence. When is it enough? http
