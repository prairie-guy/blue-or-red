RepGaramendi,This Memorial Day we think of the men and women of our armed forces who have given the ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom. Be they soldiers sailers marines airmen or merchant marines we owe them all a debt of gratitude for their ultimate sacrifice to our nation. http
RepGaramendi,Other countries have:⁃Mental illness ⁃Secular schools⁃Violent videogames⁃Schools with multiple doorsWhat do they not have? Constant mass shootings. Why? Because they aren't inundated with weapons of war. No more excuses. It's time to face the problem head-on

RepGaramendi,Look at what happened in the United States after the federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004. Enough is enough. It’s time to reinstate the federal assault weapons ban. http
RepGaramendi,I’m not afraid to say it: the @user and @user are letting children die. It’s time we fight back and reinstate the assault weapons ban. I’ve taken on the the gun lobby and won. It’s time we do so again. Our children are more important than a gun manufacturer’s profit margins.
RepGaramendi,Two years ago our nation witnessed the brutal but tragically common murder of an unarmed Black Man. George Floyd’s murder inspired a mass movement to end police violence. I voted for legislation that would end chokeholds and no-knock warrants. Now it's time for the Senate to act.
