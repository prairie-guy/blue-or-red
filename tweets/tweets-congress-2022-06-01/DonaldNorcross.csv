DonaldNorcross,Amazon employs 47% of warehouse workers in New Jersey but represents 57% of the industry‚Äôs serious injuries.Today I repeated my call for @user to look into these alarming numbers and ensure NJ workers come home the way they went to work: healthy and whole. http
DonaldNorcross,Wishing everyone in the LQBTQ+ community a happy #PrideMonth! We must never stop working to make sure LGBTQ+ Americans have equal rights opportunities and protections. http
DonaldNorcross,We‚Äôre live in front of the Amazon warehouse in Logan Township calling for ‚Å¶@OSHA_DOL‚Å© to investigate the troubling worker injury rates of Amazon warehouse workers. http
DonaldNorcross,I care about workplace safety because when I worked in construction I saw someone die on the job three different times. I‚Äôll never forget that. I will work with anyone to make sure American workers have a safe place to work regardless of industry.
DonaldNorcross,‚è∞REMINDER‚è∞ I'm hosting a virtual Service Academy Information Session this week. WHEN: Thursday at 7pm For more info and to registerhttps://t.co/ubTjEbdHZ4
DonaldNorcross,Across the board Americans support gun safety laws to save American lives. My Republican colleagues need to stand up to gun lobbyists and join us and support commonsense measures. http
DonaldNorcross,Very proud to announce that four SJ students received the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship through @user and the Rhodes Scholarship! These young leaders have made us proud and we cannot wait to see what they do with this experience.https://t.co/sC82h5sh7N
DonaldNorcross,I support health care for all because going to the doctor shouldn‚Äôt depend on the job you have or the money in your pocket.Health care is fundamental. We should act like it.
DonaldNorcross,We protect our supply chain when we strengthen our workforce. If we expand apprenticeships and job training we will not only deliver essential goods to market but we will make sure those goods are made in America.
DonaldNorcross,I thank local leaders in Camden and Gloucester for holding meaningful  #MemorialDay events this weekend.Today and every day we must remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms. http
DonaldNorcross,On #MemorialDay and every day let us remember and honor our heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our country and our families. We must never give up on their mission. Never. http
DonaldNorcross,Democratic leadership helped create 8.3 million jobs in two years allowing millions of Americans to get back to work and provide for their family.We now must have their back on inflation‚Äîmeeting the moment on gas prices and moving forward with plans to lower everyday costs.
DonaldNorcross,Doing a Registered Apprenticeship shaped my life and laid the foundation for me to go from construction work to Congress.I support the House-passed COMPETES Act to give that opportunity to every worker in America.
DonaldNorcross,This is the kind of story we need right now. For the first time in its history @user is sending all women students to @user as Rhodes Scholars and one of them is from SJ! Congratulations to Veronica (‚Äò18) and all the candidates! http
DonaldNorcross,Here‚Äôs a quick recap:‚úÖAttended a town hall in Cherry Hill‚úÖLed NJ Democrats to call on @user to investigate Amazon worker injuries‚úÖOpened GEMS to unleash clean energy in SJüïØÔ∏èMourned the lives lost to extremism and gun violence
DonaldNorcross,"Republicans say they stand for ""workers"" ""family values"" and ""personal freedom."" But their radical  attack on reproductive rights proves that's all cheap talk. Read my op-ed in the @user below. üëá#RoevWade http"
DonaldNorcross,Like an absentee father the Republican Party is happy to force women to give birth ‚Äì just don‚Äôt expect them to stick around once the child is born. Read my op-ed in the @user #RoevWadeüëáhttps://t.co/XbehELdtbe
DonaldNorcross,90% of Americans want federal action to curb gun violence. I‚Äôm ready. The ball‚Äôs in your court Senate Republicans.
DonaldNorcross,Another missed opportunity for my colleagues in the Senate to come together to safeguard our democracy and our communities. We need to be shoulder to shoulder on this. We must make our country a safer place to live. http
DonaldNorcross,10 days after the Orlando Pulse massacre I joined a group of colleagues led by the one-and-only John Lewis to demand a vote on gun safety. The Senate should not go into recess without taking meaningful action on gun safety. The House sent them over a year ago. No Bill No Break. http
DonaldNorcross,Republicans want to override personal health care decisions and lock up doctors for performing abortions.That‚Äôs not freedom. That‚Äôs not what America stands for. http
DonaldNorcross,The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has already delivered $110 billion nationwide for roads and bridges leading to more than 3600 manufacturing jobs in New Jersey alone.Not a bad six-month start.
DonaldNorcross,I‚Äôm no TV executive but it‚Äôs a bad sign when autocrats think you‚Äôre a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù that should be aired ‚Äú24/7.‚ÄùWe must stand shoulder to shoulder against this kind of hate no matter your party.https://t.co/2LQIVbKnmJ
DonaldNorcross,Virtually every single one of my colleagues has had a mass shooting in his or her district and had to send their condolences to their constituents. Senate Republicans are we going to do this again without taking action to back it up?
DonaldNorcross,Look at this graph and then tell me that mental health is the sole reason for gun violence in America. I don't buy it for a second. We are the only country in the world that revisits the gun issue without doing something. We must do what is right for our children. http
