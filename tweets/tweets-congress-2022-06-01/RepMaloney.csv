RepMaloney,HR 8 isn't some complicated 1000-page bill with sneaky provisions.It's all of 10 pages and you can read it for yourself below.All it does is ensure that there is a background check for all gun transfers. Rs should explain why they are against that. https://t.co/yJqEpeRGq7

RepMaloney,There is no moving on from these tragedies for the communities impacted every day across the country. There is no moving on for parents who will never see their children again. We cannot move on in Washington DC.
RepMaloney,We have the power to put in place commonsense legislation supported by the majority of Americans that would help stop these tragedies. We just need the will to break the NRA‚Äôs grip on Washington and the resolve to not move on after every shooting.
RepMaloney,I announced an @user hearing on gun violence in the wake of the Buffalo shooting.There have been 16 more mass shootings resulting in 33 deaths and 76 injuries since. And that does not count suicides and non-mass shootings.This is America but it does not have to be. http
RepMaloney,There was momentum for gun safety bills following El Paso and it seemed the Senate might come back into session.Instead McConnell said they needed time to work on a bill. He just wanted time for the public to forget. We can't let that happen again. http
