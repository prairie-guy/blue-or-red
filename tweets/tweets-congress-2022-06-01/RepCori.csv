RepCori,Last week’s Congress in Your Classroom visits hit differently.Talking with students at Cross Keys Middle School we shared all the different things that make us unique and that none of us deserve to be bullied for it.No student should feel unsafe at school. http
RepCori,What happened in Tulsa on the evening of May 31 1921 was a racial massacre of the highest proportion.There is no reason why descendants of that massacre should not be fully compensated for the unimaginable loss endured on this night.We need reparations. Now.
RepCori,An inspiration to all of St. Louis and athletes everywhere who know that not even the sky is their limit.Rest in power Justin Hardy. http

RepCori,Our veterans deserve universal high-quality health care.Our veterans deserve safe &amp; affordable housing.Our veterans deserve counseling and support back at home.If we really want to honor all those who have served we must invest in our veterans this #MemorialDay.
RepCori,When we found out this bill was coming to the floor we had to ensure we protected our Black brown Muslim &amp; other marginalized neighbors from being targeted &amp; criminalized.Proud of the work we did to strengthen the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act.https://t.co/Rv737cegAy
RepCori,Coldwater Creek runs along our backyards churchyards public parks &amp; elementary schools.As we work to clean up our creek we have to keep kids &amp; families out of the toxic water. Proud to introduce the Coldwater Creek Signage Act to keep St. Louis safe.https://t.co/VfEnjyACiB
RepCori,45 percent of those in federal custody are serving time for a drug offense.Today would be a great day for @user to use his executive authority to grant clemency.
