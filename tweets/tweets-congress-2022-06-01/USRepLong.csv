USRepLong,"@user &amp; #Democrats spent trillions after they shut down the economy. #JoeBiden insisted #Inflation was transitory &amp; when it came to stimulus spending he said ""The biggest risk is not going too big it’s if we go too small.” Writing blank checks got us #HyperInflation. http"
USRepLong,Unprecedented move? Well so was the #SCOTUSLeak. Fight fire with fire. The #SCOTUS leak weakened the foundation of our democratic republic and jeopardized the stability of the #JudicialBranch. http
USRepLong,EU’s Russian Oil Embargo Sends Prices Surging. Exxon Stock Is Rising. http via @user
USRepLong,#Democrats' #GoingGreen agenda has brought us #HyperInflation but you can take comfort in knowing @user sent @user to the @user last week. Where they discussed imposing more of the same restrictions that brought us $4.62 a gallon. Thanks Joe!
USRepLong,It's always an honor to deliver remarks on #MemorialDay at the #MissouriStateVeteransCemetery in #Springfield. Make no mistake this outstanding cemetery on the banks of #LakeSpringfield would have never come to fruition if not for the efforts of Chuck and Joan Wooten. @user http
USRepLong,Nothing fair about it. Did you work two jobs to pay for your #CollegeEducation? Or did you go straight into the working world and never attend college like most Americans? Well @user has some good news. Your money can go to college or at least go to pay for those that did go
USRepLong,On this #MemorialDay we remember our nation’s heroes who gave their lives to uphold the values we hold dear. We will never forget their service and sacrifice. #GodBlessAmerica http
USRepLong,It's Time to 'Give 'Em Mel' At The Federal Level. This week in Long's Short Report I talk about the need for a federal version of the Hancock Amendment to prevent Congress from raising taxes to unreasonable levels. https://t.co/3KIqLmeTMp
USRepLong,The #PandemicTreaty would not allow @user to control governments. However the #WHO should NOT be trusted nor be granted more authority given that they helped spread #ChineseCommunistParty lies at the onset of the #pandemic worsening its effect. #StopTheTreaty
USRepLong,✅On May 13th @user falsely claimed he couldn't have predicted the crisis.
USRepLong,The #BabyFormulaCrisis hearing showed us:✅It took @user too long to inspect the #Abbott facility (over 4 months) #Trump would have had it back up and running before #Biden inspected it!✅@JoeBiden knew about supply shortages in February
USRepLong,@user fails again on this self-imposed #BabyFormula crisis. He's reactive - not proactive.
USRepLong,Parents of infants are frantic and #FedUp with excuses. I asked @user Commissioner @user to rate the urgency his agency tackled the #BabyFormula issue on a scale of 1-10 and he had the audacity to say 9.5??? He must have thought 1 was the best. http
USRepLong,"Yesterday's #BabyFormulaCrisis hearing revealed in February @user was warned by @user about an upcoming #BabyFormula shortage. 3 months later on May 13th when asked could they have acted sooner @user said ""If we'd been better mind readers I guess we could have."" http"
USRepLong,@user #ExecutiveOrder he signed is like the #Democrats' #GeorgeFloydJusticeinPolicingAct which makes policing more dangerous &amp; challenging for our already overworked #LawEnforcement officers. It will hinder the #police from doing their job. Inexcusable. http
USRepLong,@user has begged:✅The #Taliban to not to attack U.S. citizens✅@OPECSecretariat to produce more #Oil✅Dictator @user to produce more oil✅Foreign nations for #BabyFormula #BeggingBiden
USRepLong,I am a signee on this letter to @user I was opposed to printing money we don't have and shipping $40 billion of it overseas while Americans suffer. However the money is out the door so now we need funding safeguards to ensure it goes directly to combat #RussianAggression. http
