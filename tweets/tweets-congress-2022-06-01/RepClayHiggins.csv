RepClayHiggins,Our legislation defunds the Biden administration’s attempt to federalize all state and local police departments. We intend to ensure that law enforcement professionals can continue to serve our communities without being leveraged into adopting left-wing policies and procedures.
RepClayHiggins,President Biden’s executive order is dangerously misguided. The Left’s anti-police agenda is driving good cops out of their careers and leading to increased crime rates across the country.https://t.co/Bn362EXlbj
RepClayHiggins,Today we reflect upon what it is to be an American. As we gather with friends and family let us prayerfully remember that 1304702 American Patriots have given the last full measure of devotion in service to our anointed nation. http
RepClayHiggins,I’m reintroducing legislation to help equip our schools with law enforcement assets and implement enhanced training standards for SROs. We have been pushing these initiatives since 2017 and we will continue working to secure America’s schools.https://t.co/cdlT5y5fDW
RepClayHiggins,I’m uplifted to see the Plaquemines LNG project moving forward. LNG export facilities like this are major economic contributors and integral to our energy security. Louisiana continues to lead the way for the American LNG industry.https://t.co/PYwnDfDS8r
RepClayHiggins,The J6 House Select Committee is so full of shit. Never ending “leaks” of partisan BS from anonymous sources. Lies on top of lies spread by liars. Every one of them should be shunned. Real Patriots are disgusted by their whole committee circus. http
RepClayHiggins,Supreme Rice is a pillar of the industry in South Louisiana. This new investment will expand existing operations create new jobs and increase economic output for Acadia Parish. https://t.co/YcSCIl936L
RepClayHiggins,These investments provide critical support for our ports waterways locks and flood control infrastructure across South Louisiana.
RepClayHiggins,Notably the FY22 Work Plan includes $50 million for Vermilion River dredging and the Calcasieu River and Pass project saw a sizable increase in funding over the President’s budget request.
RepClayHiggins,We continue to work closely with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and local stakeholders to prioritize funding for dredging and waterway projects in South Louisiana.https://t.co/exMsLxsTUv
