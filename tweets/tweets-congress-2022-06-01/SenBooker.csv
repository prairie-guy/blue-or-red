SenBooker,He was a son a father a brother. We all bear responsibility for a system that has allowed what happened to George Floyd to happen with such frequency. Changes are coming at the local state and national level. But more change is needed.
SenBooker,I applaud @user executive order to enhance accountability improve transparency and raise policing standards in an effort to help end the horrific incidents of violence that we often witness like the murder of George Floyd. http
SenBooker,For decades Congress has prevented law enforcement officers who regulate firearms from doing its job. That must end. http
SenBooker,We are the only developed nation that deals almost daily with the tragedy of gun violence at this scale. When will enough be enough? http
SenBooker,We’re telling our children loud and clear that we will not protect you so we’re going to teach you to hide. This is unacceptable. It’s time to hold those that allow these shootings to continually happen accountable. Action must be taken on every level. http
