RepSwalwell,What is wrong with gay people? http
RepSwalwell,@user @user @user I missed that! Possibly worse than a cord violation @user
RepSwalwell,@user That‚Äôs exactly right.
RepSwalwell,Speaking of drugs‚Ä¶explain this one to me: if it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot the guns but the person‚Äù ‚Äî and therefore we shouldn‚Äôt ban assault rifles ‚Äî why do we ban drugs? What an asinine argument. Of course we should ban the hardest drugs and ban the most dangerous guns. http
RepSwalwell,@user Amazing. I‚Äôm due to visit the House. #ToBetterTheMan
RepSwalwell,How? How? How? How? How?How the hell do we let this happen as a country? Children buried in superhero and princess-themed coffins. How? Because most Republicans in Congress side with mass shooters over children. #EndGunViolenceNow http
RepSwalwell,@user Congrats!
RepSwalwell,My office is introducing a new e-newsletter focused specifically on various federal funding opportunities.Interested in receiving more information? Want to hear about grants awarded in CA-15? Sign up here‚¨áÔ∏èhttps://t.co/Sgkj3RHosi http
RepSwalwell,We are going to vote this week in @user to raise the age to buy an assault weapon to 21. *I‚Äôve written legislation to ban and buyback weapons of mass destruction. But with slim majorities in Congress increasing the purchase age is a step that can make use safer.
RepSwalwell,http
RepSwalwell,Isn‚Äôt there a gif for this? http
RepSwalwell,Big gun. Tiny man. http
RepSwalwell,@user They could be brothers!
RepSwalwell,On Memorial Day we stop to honor the heroes who are no longer with us. We can start by thanking the service members who made the ultimate sacrifice for their nation and work harder to support those in arms who are still with us today. http
RepSwalwell,My man. http
RepSwalwell,Can someone tell me who this is? http
RepSwalwell,@user But @user voted for background checks. Before Uvalde. If he‚Äôs open-minded about assault weapons we should give him the space. Not shame him. http
RepSwalwell,Amazing! Thank you for flagging the good work of our law enforcement. Now why don‚Äôt you all actually support them? @user keeps voting against police funding and dishonors January 6 heroes. http
RepSwalwell,This is what we call ‚Äúopen-minded.‚Äù It means you‚Äôre not so dug in so focused on self-preservation and so beholden to an industry but rather you can change your mind as circumstances evolve. http
RepSwalwell,Trying to explain Memorial Day to my littles. They weren‚Äôt tracking. Finally I said ‚Äúwe are remembering the superheroes who defended America.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs about superheroes!‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about superheroes. God Bless every one of them who died for us. #MemorialDayWeekend
RepSwalwell,@user @user My work here is done.
RepSwalwell,You own the dead schoolchildren crisis. http
RepSwalwell,Republicans don‚Äôt believe in responsible gun rights. They believe in reckless gun sales.
RepSwalwell,The kids died. Trump danced. http
RepSwalwell,üì∫WATCH This #MemorialDayWeekend thank you @user for honoring @user and the work they do to serve America. The best way to honor our fallen is to take good care of those serving. http
RepSwalwell,If we accept our schools are not protected well enough that not all police are trained to respond to a mass shooter and that we have a severe mental health crisis in America then why on earth would we want to add into that mix easy access to assault rifles?
RepSwalwell,Where are the babies @user They‚Äôre dead. They‚Äôre dead in their classroom because you won‚Äôt do shit to protect them. You done? http
RepSwalwell,There is not a classier team the @user have played this season than the @user From @user through the entire roster the Mavs played us hard and were always class acts.
RepSwalwell,I‚Äôm staying up to see Charles Barkley eat all the @user crow. @NBAonTNT #DubNation #nbafinals
RepSwalwell,@user That Maryland degree is paying off!
RepSwalwell,Keep praying. We‚Äôre working. http
RepSwalwell,The classmates of the slaughtered Uvalde students are too young to be activists for gun safety. But you can be their activist. You can be their voice. It starts by registering to vote &amp; voting to protect the kids who are still with us. Will you do that? http
RepSwalwell,Running shorts + big ass cup of coffee + Penny = live with @user on @user http
RepSwalwell,You can‚Äôt make it up. They would sooner turn schools into prisons than pass gun-safety laws. http
RepSwalwell,These are my superheroes. When they‚Äôre not saving the universe my job is to protect them. That‚Äôs our most important job as parents. If our country has unrestricted weaponry we cannot truly protect them. Time to pass violent history checks and assault weapons ban. #EndGunViolence http
RepSwalwell,What a whiny man-baby Florida has for a U.S. senator. Rubio is threatened by a tribute to 19 slaughtered babies and their teachers? I bet he‚Äôd really hate it if you listened to the Miami Heat‚Äôs call to action and turned out to vote. RT if you‚Äôre voting this Fall. #SorryMarco http
RepSwalwell,Ted Cruz didn‚Äôt fire the rounds that killed 19 Texas babies. But he made it a hell of a lot easier for the killer who did.
RepSwalwell,The guy who wouldn‚Äôt defend his wife when it was politically inconvenient should not be relied upon to defend your family. http
RepSwalwell,Wishing the officer a speedy recovery. As we saw in Dallas a few years back when a shooter is armed with an assault rifle even our well-trained police can be overmatched. What do we do? #BanAssaultWeaponsNow http
