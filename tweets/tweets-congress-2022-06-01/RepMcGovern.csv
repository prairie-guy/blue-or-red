RepMcGovern,The @user Conference on hunger will create transformative change. The first biweekly stakeholder call will be held by the White House today at 3:30pm to provide updates on the conference. RSVP here: http
RepMcGovern,For most of history nations were ruled not by the peopleâ€”but by despots &amp; dictators. Weâ€™ve always been a work in progress but Americaâ€™s cause is the cause of humanity.Our republic is in crisisâ€”yet tonightâ€™s town hall with @user is what defending our democracy looks like. http
RepMcGovern,HAPPENING SOON: Watch live as @user and I hold a town hall in Northampton to discuss defending our democracy and ensuring that the voice of the American people is heard in Washington.https://t.co/pMsdl4rHg3
RepMcGovern,The U.S. had an assault weapon ban from 1994 to 2004. After the ban expired mass shootings tripled. Our kids deserve safe schools now. http
RepMcGovern,TONIGHT: Thereâ€™s still time to add your voice to this timely discussion with me and @user in Northampton on defending our democracy. I hope youâ€™ll join the conversation! http
RepMcGovern,I was honored to be present yesterday at Memorial Day remembrances in Leominster Sutton and Worcester.Joining together as a community we honor those who gave their lives in service to our nation. http
RepMcGovern,One of the most important ways we can do this is by caring for those who served and did come home with wounds both visible and invisible as well as their families and those they leave behind.https://t.co/IWwKjN5THi
RepMcGovern,On #MemorialDay we remember &amp; honor the brave servicemembers who paid the ultimate price to defend our nation.While we can never repay our debt of gratitude to them we must honor them with action and not just words. http
RepMcGovern,COVID-19 made Americaâ€™s hunger problem even worse.And returning to the pre-COVID status quo would leave tens of millions of people hungry. A @user conference on hunger will create a future where families can confidently put food on the table. http
RepMcGovern,We get it. Mass shooting are committed by evil people. But a system that so easily puts a gun in their hands doesnâ€™t help. Basic gun reforms wonâ€™t solve everything but if they prevent even one senseless killing isnâ€™t that a good thing? http
RepMcGovern,Two years ago this bill to prevent homegrown extremism domestic terror &amp; white supremacist violence passed the House with unanimous support.Flash forward to 2022: Senate Republicans just blocked it.What changed? What are they afraid of?https://t.co/daG5GfzDXS
RepMcGovern,Live in Whately Sunderland Hatfield or Hadley? Letâ€™s grab coffee.  All are welcome!â˜• Bubâ€™s BBQ 676 Amherst Rd Sunderland MA 01375ðŸ—“ Saturday June 4thðŸ•˜ 1:30 p.m. http
RepMcGovern,College students are up against a rigged system. If we can bail out big banks give tax cuts to corporations and write blank checks to he Pentagon then we can cancel student loan debt. http
RepMcGovern,At the end of the day restaurants &amp; supermarkets throw out tons of food thatâ€™s perfectly good to eat. I was honored to join @user for the launch of their Worcester County program saving food from the trash &amp; getting it to families in need through local nonprofits. http
RepMcGovern,A clean energy future means JOBS. Glad to see @user Biden announcing that Hyundai will invest over $5.5 billion in domestic manufacturing to create a new generation of electric vehicles and batteries right here in the United States. http
RepMcGovern,Republicans denounce gun violence yet they refuse to lift a finger to do anything about it. Whether itâ€™s churches grocery stores or schools Congress needs to act to ensure American families can feel safe in their communities. http
RepMcGovern,Starting college early gives students a better shot at success. I was excited to lead a conversation about the Early College Worcester program with @user Deputy Secretary Cindy Marten leaders from @user @user and @user and education advocates. http
RepMcGovern,Coach Kerr is right. Most Americans get this too.It's sickening Washington Republicans are so weighed down by NRA money that they aren't moved by dead kids.How can we do nothing? We all agree gun violence is a terrible problem. We must take action. http
