RepRaulGrijalva,"Joined the @politico #Sustainability summit today to discuss how we at the federal level can protect our public lands and waters, preserve them and move forward in a way that allows biodiversity to thrive. https://t.co/YdwK9k9xnb"
RepRaulGrijalva,"I called on oil and gas companies to testify before @NRDems on their push for a drilling free-for-all and raising gas prices despite record profits.

They didn't show up. 

It's time to crack down on price gouging. https://t.co/etw25O5PFn"
RepRaulGrijalva,"As we fight to advance LGBTQI+ rights abroad, the U.S. must model what it means to create an inclusive society for LGBTQI+ people at home. 

We must do everything we can to push back against state legislature attacks on LGBTQI+ people in this fight for equality. #IDAHOBIT"
RepRaulGrijalva,Funny to hear @JeffBezos and the billionaire class excuses for not providing living wages or paying their taxes. Monopolies like Amazon are inflating prices and making billions off working people while Bezos billionaires' profits soar and Americans suffer.
RepRaulGrijalva,We have a duty to act on gun violence and call out these attacks for what they are and condemn those peddling racial demagoguery and replacement theory. (3/3)
RepRaulGrijalva,White supremacist ideology is wreaking havoc on communities across the country &amp; is emboldened by nationalist rhetoric promoted by Republican enablers. There is no room for white supremacy as a political message in the national conversation. (2/3)
RepRaulGrijalva,Our hearts mourn the victims of those in Buffalo and across the United States impacted by gun violence and our thoughts are with the victims’ families and first responders who will experience this trauma for the rest of their lives. (1/3)
RepRaulGrijalva,"The Supreme Court is planning to take away women’s power to control their own bodies and decisions over their reproductive health, but not if we have anything to say about it. 

Abortion remains legal, and we’re going to fight like hell to keep it that way. #BansOffOurBodies https://t.co/jRHjWjVI3Z"
RepRaulGrijalva,"I am proud to have received an ""A"" score from of End Citizens United / Let America Vote. Since my time in Congress I've always fought to protect the right to vote and strengthen our democracy. Thank you, @StopBigMoney https://t.co/hTAQksdjH6"
RepRaulGrijalva,"I am excited to announce Ashley Alvarez, a sophomore from Desert View High School, as the winner of the 2022 Congressional Art Competition for AZ03. Ashley has earned a free trip to D.C. to see her artwork entitled “Follow the Golden Flame"" be displayed in the U.S. Capitol. https://t.co/qa0RzStH4n"
RepRaulGrijalva,"It's time to enact a windfall tax on the oil and gas companies that are raking in record profits in a time of crisis. 

Big Oil should feel America’s pain at the pump as a motivation to lower costs—not an invitation to price gouge working people.

RepRaulGrijalva,"This decision will prevent bad faith mining companies from dumping toxic waste and protect tribal sacred sites that have existed since time immemorial. I’m proud to stand with my brothers and sisters of the Tohono O’odham Nation, Pascua Yaqui Tribe, and Hopi Tribe in this fight. https://t.co/rSlRlCS9sK"
