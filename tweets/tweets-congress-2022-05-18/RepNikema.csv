RepNikema,"There is no time to lose getting baby formula back to families. I am proud to have voted to pass legislation tonight that will help our parents and families, including Black and brown communities already struggling. No parent should have to worry about food for their baby."
RepNikema,"ALSO TODAY, I will vote for legislation that will give low-income families more access to infant formula. Families who depend on the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) nutrition program need access to safe, reliable infant formula, and we need to make sure it's available.

RepNikema,"TODAY, I will vote to pass legislation giving the FDA $28 million to address the urgent infant formula shortage. That funding will help the FDA approve more baby formula companies while stopping fraudulent products and producers from hurting parents and children.

RepNikema,"Parents and families should NEVER have to worry that they cannot feed their infants. Earlier this week, I signed @RepSherrill's letter asking @POTUS to immediately take action to get infant formula into parents' hands. Today, I'm glad to see the House taking action too:

RepNikema,"The @NewDemCoalition turns 25 this year!

I'm proud to be a (new!) #NewDem in Congress and even prouder to work with my colleagues to bring new jobs to the #FightingFifth, build Black wealth across the country and advance social justice in our economy!"
RepNikema,"Iâ€™m a proud union member. I've seen first-hand the difference that unions make for workers, and I know that EVERY worker deserves a fair vote and a fair chance to form a union. That's why I support the #PROAct to empower workers and protect their right to organize. https://t.co/1Zuo5ifsXQ"
RepNikema,"I'm proud to be #HBCUmade and I will never pass up the chance to shout out HBCUs and Black excellence in higher education.

RepNikema,"Everyone in the #FightingFifth deserves high-quality job training and a high-quality job. I am so glad that the House voted tonight to pass the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, funding important workforce development systems that will train a MILLION workers a year."
RepNikema,"Education is power.

On this day in 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in #BrownvBoard that racially segregated public schools were unconstitutional. Now, in 2022, the decision reminds us to keep fighting until the promise of equal access to quality, nurturing education is fulfilled. https://t.co/fThRGGoeI3"
RepNikema,"Saturday, we saw Black people in Buffalo murdered in a premeditated act of white supremacist violence. My heart aches for the Buffalo community, but we need to do more.

We CANNOT accept that white supremacist terror and violence are inevitable in this country. We need to act!"
RepNikema,"Today is the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, a day to acknowledge the violence and discrimination experienced by LGBTQI+ people around the world. We MUST stand up against that hate, intolerance and violence #OutLoudOnPurpose https://t.co/JyM4nKGH7X"
RepNikema,"Great news! As the proud mama of a six-year old, I'm so glad to see a booster approved for kids 5 and up. Vaccines save lives and Iâ€™m going to make sure my Carter Cakes gets his booster ASAP.

RepNikema,"Last year, @POTUS signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. I proudly voted for it and knew that it would pay off for years to come.

So how are we doing? In JUST SIX MONTHS, Georgia has received $2.7B for transportation, fighting climate change and more. With more to come!"
RepNikema,My heart breaks for the victims of todayâ€™s mass shooting in #Buffalo. My prayers are with everyone touched by this senseless tragedy. Enough! We must take decisive action against white supremacy and extremism.
RepNikema,"Back to Washington and back to work representing the #FightingFifth.

Let me catch you up on this week with #NikemasNotes! https://t.co/pToPYQVeBP"
RepNikema,I am glad to see the NLRB taking serious action. The length to which companies like Starbucks and Amazon will go to stop their employees exercising their rights is PROOF of the difference that unions make to their members. Every worker deserves a union! https://t.co/DHVSz0mQQC
RepNikema,"Student loan debt is an American nightmare for 40 MILLION Americans. Pausing loan payments only postpones the nightmare, it doesn't end it. Cancel student debt and help rescue the American dream!"
RepNikema,"â€œI worked on the frontlines of reproductive health care and saw the sacrifices people still make to legally get the care they need. Criminalizing people who need or who provide this care wonâ€™t save lives."" ðŸ“£ðŸ“£ðŸ“£

RepNikema,"Congress needs to declare a vision for a future where access to essential health care is free from restrictions and bans, and people are able to manage care on their own terms, free from discrimination or punishment. 

Learn about my resolution here:
