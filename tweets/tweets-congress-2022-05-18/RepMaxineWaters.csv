RepMaxineWaters,The Justice Department has a responsibility to identify and track down white supremacists and domestic terrorists who have taken certain identifiable criminal acts that define them. The FBI must make arrests and follow through with appropriate convictions.
RepMaxineWaters,"When the justice system acts promptly to apprehend and convict white supremacists who prey upon Black, Asian and other minorities, perhaps this can be a deterrent to the killing of innocent people."
RepMaxineWaters,"White supremacists are lurking in this country, and Black people, particularly those highly visible, are vulnerable. The right-wing haters must take responsibility for their rhetoric, actions, and hatred against black people."
RepMaxineWaters,"For many of us, our lives are in danger every day. The attacks and threats we receive from white supremacists are real. This atrocity by a white supremacist in Buffalo is unforgivable and cannot be simply dismissed as insanity."
RepMaxineWaters,"Happy birthday to my dear friend &amp; genius Stevie Wonder. Thanks Stevie, for Radio Station KJLH. Thanks for the wonderful songs you have entertained us with! Thanks for initiating MLK's birthday celebration. Thanks for your support for freedom, justice, and peace for this country."
