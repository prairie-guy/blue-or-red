ChrisVanHollen,"This weekend, after feeling lightheaded while delivering a speech, I sought medical attention at the recommendation of the Attending Physician. I’m feeling much better but will follow doctors' orders and curtail my schedule for the next few days. My full statement is below: https://t.co/1sYq7FZMqS"
ChrisVanHollen,Horrified and sickened by this act of pure evil. We must directly confront racism wherever it raises its vile head — and bring the heinous perpetrators of hate crimes to justice. https://t.co/2A2xGJf479
ChrisVanHollen,"I stand with each and every person marching across Maryland &amp; our country today in support of reproductive rights and freedom of choice. We cannot – and will not – let up in the battle to protect and codify #RoevWade. We face a real and present danger, and we must fight back."
ChrisVanHollen,"No family should live in fear of not knowing how they will provide their child their next meal. The baby formula shortage is unacceptable, and we’re calling on manufacturers to increase supply at once. https://t.co/Zmhk2CPgjI"
ChrisVanHollen,Agree. This simply adds trauma on top of a tragedy. Need immediate accountability for these attacks on people mourning the death of American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. And her killer must be brought to justice. https://t.co/3JoJEGLr7D
ChrisVanHollen,Agree with you 100% @SenWhitehouse. That’s why I’ve fought this absurd GOP rider for years &amp; even filed a lawsuit against the IRS for allowing the misinterpretation of the existing statute to stand. It’s time to put a stop to this unlimited dark-money spending. https://t.co/S4vRDPBufK
ChrisVanHollen,"This isn’t about politics – it’s about providing the American people with answers. Our democracy came dangerously close to the edge on Jan 6th &amp; to ensure something like this never happens again, we need the whole truth. https://t.co/EWFRCo5djD"
ChrisVanHollen,"Maryland’s families &amp; communities have been ravaged by the opioid epidemic. We need solutions now. I’m working to eliminate barriers to treatment, and I support legislation like the Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act to help get this done. https://t.co/n17ld4wSWp"
ChrisVanHollen,"Corporations shouldn’t be rewarded for union busting. That’s why @SenBobCasey, Senator @RonWyden, and I just introduced our bill to ensure that corporations no longer get to claim a tax deduction for spending money to interfere with a union election or break labor laws. https://t.co/azoUomQpsc"
