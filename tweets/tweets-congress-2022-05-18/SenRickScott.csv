SenRickScott,"üö®WATCHüö® @SenateDems shamelessly defend green lighting reckless deficit spending when @JoeBiden‚Äôs raging inflation is already at 8%. 

Democrats would rather cover for a confused, failed president than help families struggling under Biden‚Äôs inflation-fueling agenda. üëÄüîΩ https://t.co/HEfIeuAxj4"
SenRickScott,".@SenateDems proved again today that they don‚Äôt care about American families suffering from @JoeBiden‚Äôs record-breaking inflation crisis &amp; skyrocketing prices.

Even when inflation is way up, Democrats will throw fuel to the fire with more reckless spending. üëÄüîΩ https://t.co/iY9XfR7Fee"

SenRickScott,.@DHSgov‚Äôs ‚Äúdisinformation board‚Äù is nothing but another dangerous attempt by Democrats to crack down on Americans‚Äô free speech. Biden‚Äôs federal thought police is straight out of Orwell‚Äôs 1984. It has no place in America &amp; should be shut down permanently. https://t.co/q63gPFcIEd
SenRickScott,"As Biden‚Äôs gas price crisis gets worse every day, truckers are feeling even more pain at the pump. It‚Äôs time for @JoeBiden to put American energy first &amp; ditch his failed, radical Green New Deal agenda. https://t.co/H8xo7L98hd"
SenRickScott,"Full shelves of baby formula in Guatemala, but parents in United States are driving hours &amp; finding nothing.

The @WhiteHouse &amp; @US_FDA are not doing enough to keep parents updated. This is an unbelievable crisis hurting babies. @JoeBiden needs to fix it NOW. https://t.co/Eqsa94RyB2"
SenRickScott,"Looking forward to watching the @FlaPanthers &amp; @TBLightning battle for the Sunshine State &amp; the @StanleyCup!

Who are you rooting for? #GoBolts #TimeToHunt"
SenRickScott,"El apaciguamiento de los reg√≠menes asesinos y malvados de Cuba y Venezuela por parte de @JoeBiden es repugnante. 

Esto desestabilizar√° a√∫n m√°s a LATAM y no ayudar√° en nada a la lucha por la libertad, la democracia y los derechos humanos de los pueblos de Cuba y Venezuela."
SenRickScott,".@JoeBiden‚Äôs appeasement of the murderous, evil regimes in Cuba and Venezuela is disgusting.

This will further destabilize LATAM &amp; do nothing to help the fight for freedom, democracy &amp; human rights for the people of Cuba &amp; Venezuela. https://t.co/M8u2ZoKYIg"
SenRickScott,"Israel is our great ally &amp; the continued anti-Semitism from radical socialists in the House is horrific. These are @SpeakerPelosi‚Äôs Democrat members. Does she agree with them? If not, she must immediately condemn this. https://t.co/ctokHJexh3"
SenRickScott,"While shelves around the world are stocked full with baby formula, parents in Florida &amp; across America are spending hours struggling to find food for their babies. It‚Äôs unacceptable to see this happen in America.

SenRickScott,".@SecMayorkas has repeatedly lied to Americans &amp; Congress that our southern border is ‚Äúclosed,‚Äù but here‚Äôs the truth: illegal border crossings are at a RECORD-HIGH. 

We cannot let @JoeBiden repeal Title 42 &amp; make this crisis even worse. RT üîÅ if you agree! https://t.co/erCfWxksdQ"
SenRickScott,"La decisi√≥n de @JoeBiden de aliviar las sanciones contra @NicolasMaduro y sus matones es INCONSCIENTE. Biden debe centrarse en acabar con el r√©gimen de Maduro, proteger los DD. HH. y ayudar a la gente de VZ a lograr su libertad y democracia, no en apaciguar a dictadores brutales."
SenRickScott,".@JoeBiden‚Äôs decision to ease sanctions on @NicolasMaduro &amp; his evil thugs is UNCONSCIONABLE. 

Biden should be focused on ending Maduro‚Äôs regime, protecting human rights &amp; helping the VZ people achieve freedom &amp; democracy - not appeasing brutal dictators. https://t.co/gvrQop8U7x"
SenRickScott,El repugnante apaciguamiento a los reg√≠menes ileg√≠timos de Cuba y Venezuela por parte de @JoeBiden no har√° NADA m√°s que amenazar la democracia y la estabilidad de Am√©rica Latina. Lo √∫nico que debemos discutir con @NicolasMaduro es el lugar y la hora en que dejar√° el cargo.
SenRickScott,.@JoeBiden‚Äôs disgusting appeasement of the illegitimate regimes in Cuba and Venezuela will do NOTHING but threaten democracy and the stability of Latin America. The only thing we should discuss with @NicolasMaduro is the time and place he will leave office. https://t.co/eFU2YpSyKS
SenRickScott,"Ann &amp; I are heartbroken to hear of the passing of Gus Machado. Gus was a true leader who loved freedom, lived his American dream &amp; longed to see his native homeland, Cuba, free. 

We‚Äôre praying for his wife, Lilliam, &amp; his family during this difficult time."
SenRickScott,"Shelves are stocked full of baby formula in Singapore, Panama, Brazil, &amp; Colombia. This isn‚Äôt a global issue. It‚Äôs failed leadership in the United States &amp; parents can‚Äôt afford to wait days or weeks to solve it. @JoeBiden needs to fix this NOW. https://t.co/cHD1cBL5R6"

Es por eso que retendr√© TODAS las nominaciones relevantes hasta que se revierta esta repugnante decisi√≥n."
SenRickScott,"While problems here at home like securing the border, fighting inflation &amp; fixing major supply issues demand our attention, we can‚Äôt ignore that Ukraine needs lethal aid to defeat Russia &amp; win this war. 
U.S. nat‚Äôl sec is on the line. We can &amp; must do both.https://t.co/5JuxZx5tF5"
SenRickScott,".@JoeBiden‚Äôs appeasement of the illegitimate communist Cuban regime will funnel $$ to the regime &amp; its military at the cost of MORE oppression for the Cuban people.

SenRickScott,"For over a year, I‚Äôve been calling on the Biden admin to fight fraud and abuse of enhanced unemployment benefits. Wasting $163 BILLION of taxpayer dollars to pay people more to stay home than go to work with zero gov‚Äôt accountability is UNACCEPTABLE. Americans deserve answers. https://t.co/TTpXMtEh4J"
SenRickScott,"Everything the Chinese Communist Party says about Uyghurs is a LIE. This is the truth of Xi‚Äôs oppression &amp; genocide in the Uyghur homeland. 

Communist China‚Äôs crimes cannot be covered up &amp; no U.S. company can justify doing business with this evil regime. https://t.co/pmPzlHy28t"
SenRickScott,"This is the right move, @McDonalds. For months, I‚Äôve been urging companies to get out of Russia. Remaining in Russia only fuels Putin‚Äôs murderous war machine &amp; his attacks on Ukraine.

SenRickScott,The @WHO has served as a puppet for the Chinese Communist Party &amp; helped Communist China cover up info on COVID-19.

SenRickScott,"We must continue to increase access to broadband, but this bill is $45 BILLION in taxpayer spending w/ zero transparency on how the gov't will spend YOUR tax $$.

SenRickScott,Levantar las sanciones al brutal r√©gimen de Maduro es una bofetada para los valientes venezolanos que sufren bajo su dictadura y solo sufrir√°n m√°s mientras el r√©gimen sigue robando los recursos naturales de Venezuela para su beneficio personal.
SenRickScott,Lifting sanctions on Maduro‚Äôs brutal regime is a slap in the face to the brave Venezuelans who are suffering under his dictatorship and will only suffer more as he continues to steal Venezuela‚Äôs natural resources for his personal gain. https://t.co/oASdmTIsEM

SenRickScott,I‚Äôm urging House &amp; Senate conferees of the $250 BILLION COMPETES Act to include my proposal to ensure all taxpayer funds get a ROI analysis with claw-back provisions. Inflation is at a 40-YEAR high. Congress must be accountable for every tax dollar spent. https://t.co/0Khz6almlT
SenRickScott,"I‚Äôve been clear: if you‚Äôre working, I don‚Äôt want you to pay even $1 more in taxes. Unlike @JoeBiden &amp; Democrats, I‚Äôm actually fighting to cut taxes for hardworking families.

What we can‚Äôt have is people who can work, but choose to live free off the taxpayer. That must end. (2/2)"
SenRickScott,"The media has taken Biden‚Äôs confused lies as gospel. Big surprise. 

Here‚Äôs the truth: I‚Äôm a tax cutter. I‚Äôve cut taxes more than anyone in Washington - over 100 times as Governor of Florida. I‚Äôm about getting folks back to work &amp; I‚Äôll never support higher taxes. (1/2)"
SenRickScott,"PPI inflation is at 11%. That‚Äôs UNACCEPTABLE. This is @JoeBiden‚Äôs inflation crisis &amp; the best way to solve it is for him to resign. We‚Äôve had enough of his confused, incoherent &amp; failed leadership. https://t.co/UhSGJZvmMf"
