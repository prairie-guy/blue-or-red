RepMikeJohnson,WATCH: Pro-abortion Democrat activists admit their support for abortion all the way up until the very moment of birth (...and maybe later?). https://t.co/vXUxtyv6RN
RepMikeJohnson,"Biden's ""Disinformation Board"" was doomed from the start, not because of Republican criticism, but because - as I explained repeatedly - it was CLEARLY unconstitutional and un-American.

Good riddance. https://t.co/2JGZfHqTsR"
RepMikeJohnson,"“When does human life begin?""

""Does abortion take a human life?""

Asking simple, basic questions to pro-abortion Democrats has never once yielded a sensible answer. https://t.co/5aMmlZr5x1"
RepMikeJohnson,"We have to start calling abortion policy in the United States plainly what it is:

An extreme outlier in the world. https://t.co/SUod00NG6Q"
RepMikeJohnson,"Today's House Judiciary Committee hearing on ""abortion access"" is just another brazen Democrat attempt to intimidate the Supreme Court. https://t.co/k8EjFQlsyP"
RepMikeJohnson,Want to know why you're paying record highs for gas prices? Watch this: https://t.co/sMOOBSvoEn
RepMikeJohnson,"Gas prices hit another record high today, and what’s the Administration’s response? Let’s buy 20x more electric vehicles!

So shockingly out of touch with the everyday realities of the American people. https://t.co/WCnsGtnpZF"
RepMikeJohnson,"There are currently more than 30 presidential declarations of “national emergencies” in effect, dating all the way back to Jimmy Carter.

The power to do this has been abused too often for partisan purposes and it is long past time for Congress to reclaim its authority. https://t.co/KGQuePX0eN"
RepMikeJohnson,https://t.co/LKweKbGibU
RepMikeJohnson,"The latest gas price spike is just another example of the vital importance of a strong energy sector and policies that prioritize U.S. energy production. 

We must bring energy independence HOME, and stop bending the knee to foreign dictators to fuel our nation. https://t.co/UhfwOD64N9"

RepMikeJohnson,"It was an honor today to attend the 307th Bomb Wing Change of Command ceremony at Barksdale Air Force Base. Congrats to Col. Steven W. Kirkpatrick on his retirement &amp; distinguished career, &amp; to Col. David R. Anderson on his new command. “The Long Rangers” are in good hands! https://t.co/DUcqU9YHJ8"

RepMikeJohnson,"Friends, as we celebrate #NationalPoliceWeek I wanted to highlight some of the extraordinary law enforcement officers and departments who go above and beyond to serve and protect our communities. Thank you for all you do! https://t.co/qNO9DZaonH"
RepMikeJohnson,"I joined @jaysekulow &amp; @jordansekulow this week to discuss @JudiciaryGOP’s explosive whistleblower evidence of parents being investigated by the FBI for voicing their opinions at school board meetings.

RepMikeJohnson,"**RECOMMENDED READ (2 min.)** 
Victor Davis Hanson summarizes our current crisis clearly--and ominously.    @VDHanson @DailySignal https://t.co/zVkHpti5ld"
RepMikeJohnson,"After more than a year of soaring crime and carnage in our cities, Biden is finally asking states to direct some of the $1.9 trillion spending bill towards local law enforcement. 

We have been calling for this since last summer.

RepMikeJohnson,Remember: the destruction is intentional. https://t.co/GaCRryCT8A
RepMikeJohnson,"This week, I spoke on the House Floor to recognize #NationalPoliceWeek and honor all of our nation's law enforcement officers.
 
Those who put their lives in danger every day to protect and serve our communities deserve our continued gratitude and support. https://t.co/zl87PDv7VF"
RepMikeJohnson,"This week, I was truly honored to be presented with the Charles Dick Medal of Merit award from the National Guard Association of the United States. I will always have the backs of those who serve and protect. https://t.co/S1ZGTZAXJN"
RepMikeJohnson,"Biden's 'Ministry of Truth' is plainly unconstitutional, and it must be stopped.

Proud to join my @HouseGOP colleagues in taking a stand against this outrageous and un-American idea. https://t.co/kq3lX4ITnY"

RepMikeJohnson,"NEWS

45 @HouseGOP Members just filed a resolution condemning intimidation tactics used by pro-abortion activists.

As the White House continues to equivocate, this makes the position of Congress clear: intimidation tactics must be condemned, and lawlessness must be prosecuted. https://t.co/KodN8MfvTw"
RepMikeJohnson,"Last night on the House Floor it was my honor to present the resolution to elect my dear friend, @RepJuliaLetlow, to fill the open seat on the COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS.

RepMikeJohnson,"Democrats want to get rid of the filibuster right before they lose Congress for a bill that can’t even get 50 votes...

@JudiciaryGOP has whistleblower evidence that the FBI labeled dozens of parents with a counterterrorism ""threat tag,"" despite testimony under oath from Merrick Garland that this never happened. https://t.co/9QsSob9feO"

Late last night I got them to admit the goal is to TURN ILLEGALS INTO VOTERS! https://t.co/sBL8dWIbDD"
