USRepLong,"#Democrats are once again throwing money at a problem they helped create. I will vote 'no' on #HR7790, which grants $28 million for the #BabyFormulaCrisis, b/c it doesn't specify how the funds will solve the problem. The solution lies with @JoeBiden &amp; @US_FDA  doing their job."
USRepLong,I want to thank Ron Leone of the #Missouri #Petroleum Marketers &amp; Convenience Association and @JgreerGreer of @mfaoil for stopping by my office today. Their dedicated service is appreciated during this #EnergyCrisis. https://t.co/AQBI5qCwGb
USRepLong,"#Trump's enactment of #Title42 saved thousands of lives by slowing the spread of #COVID &amp; by curbing the flow of #fentanyl into the #US. I'm proud to co-sponsor #HR6531, which allows #Title42 to be used for fentanyl/other drugs which are the leading cause of death for 18-45 y/o."
USRepLong,@JoeBiden's #GoingGreen agenda and his habit of printing money we don't have for his spending sprees are 2 huge contributing factors to his record-breaking #inflation. This #BrokenRecord routine of blaming #Putin or #Democrat mandated #COVID shutdowns won't solve the problem. https://t.co/PhNv0LA9s0
USRepLong,"@JoeBiden's record-breaking streak continues. Under his sage leadership, @CBP has encountered the highest number of migrants at the southern #border in a single month in #USHistory. 234,088 #Illegals were encountered. https://t.co/kS2X4MhEpm"
USRepLong,"#Democrats would rather pass #HR7688 -which allows for socialist price-fixing of private businesses- than pass the #AmericanEnergyIndependenceFromRussiaAct, which increases domestic production and boosts energy exports to help our allies become less dependent on #RussianEnergy."
USRepLong,@JoeBiden's record-breaking Presidency set a new all-time high for #GasPrices 8 days in a row. $4.52 a gallon! And a new all-time high for #JimmyCarter's Presidency. Carter moved up one spot to the second #WorstPresidentEver. https://t.co/MPwhLZ7Icw
USRepLong,I'm not sure what you did Saturday. I'm sure many of you were at work to help pay for rising #Inflation &amp; #GasPrices. Or maybe you were out looking for #babyformula. I'm sure very few of you were on a #ShoppingSpree on #SaksFifthAvenue with @SpeakerPelosi. https://t.co/a5hGobpEcu https://t.co/3dAsFM5o44
USRepLong,"#Democrats are like a #BrokenRecord, shirking responsibility and shifting blame for the energy crisis their #GoingGreen agenda caused. I will be voting 'NO' on HR 7688, a.k.a. the Socialist Energy Price-Fixing Act, which allows unprecedented government control on gasoline prices."
USRepLong,"@JoeBiden is deceiving the public once again by painting a rosy picture of the economy, pointing to ""strong wage growth"" as an indicator of his success. In reality, #inflation is outpacing #WageGrowth in multiple industries, according to @BusinessInsider &amp; @BLS_gov https://t.co/UwiXtOP7fo"
USRepLong,"Sometimes when people try and make fun of me, it doesn't bother me at all, especially when I'm standing up for the innocent unborn. Standing up for those that can't stand up for themselves. #ProLife @MORightToLife @momsforamerica https://t.co/YagHDFFJb5 https://t.co/sezhF3Kjub"
USRepLong,"As #ProLife support grows, right on cue, the #Democrats have turned to fear-mongering to mislead the public. Read about these 5 commonly repeated false narratives regarding #RoeVWade. https://t.co/XPd5GuAaY1"
USRepLong,@renaultgroup latest move to sell off their #Russian assets is an indication that #sanctions and international pressure on Russia is working. #VladYouDidThis https://t.co/vNEfxJZQmr
USRepLong,"""#GoldenArches to go dark in #Russia as @McDonaldsCorp exits after 30 + years."" The corporate exodus will persist so long as Russia continues perpetrating atrocities in #Ukraine or anywhere else it chooses. #VladYouDidThis

USRepLong,"“#Saudi #oil giant @Aramco's first-quarter profits surge 80%.”

As our dependence on foreign oil increases, so do their profits. #JoeBidenYouDidThis #DrillBabyDrill"
USRepLong,"If the #DisinformationGovernanceBoard were to be established, news like this would be censored and classified as 'false.' The government can't be trusted to govern 'truth.' @washingtonpost should award them 4 crackpots!"
USRepLong,"@PressSec stated @JoeBiden's administration is not funding #crackpipes via smoking kits and that it's a ""conspiracy theory."" #WashingtonFreeBeacon found every location they visited - all eligible to receive grant funding this month- provided crack pipes.

USRepLong,"When I Want Your Opinion I'll Give It To You. This week in Long's Short Report, I talk about how very few Republicans want to talk about Roe v. Wade possibly being overturned, instead focusing on the leak alone. I'll always tell you exactly what I think.

USRepLong,I'm a proud co-sponsor of this resolution which will be vital in protecting the @SCOTUS justices &amp; prevent further intimidation. It's amazing to me that the #Democrats are refusing to condemn the harassment and threats of @SCOTUS justices. https://t.co/r3HfvMFbCf
USRepLong,"If @joebiden had addressed the #babyformulashortage with the same urgency he did sending $40 billion to #Ukraine, we would have averted this serious crisis. In a letter to @US_FDA Commissioner @DrCaliff_FDA and #JoeBiden I urged a swift resolution to this emergency."
USRepLong,"Boat manufacturers reign supreme in my outdoors-minded District, so I was thrilled the @therealnmma folks stopped by my #DC office today. Special thanks to Melanie Ashby, Jeff Coffman of @GoRollick, DJ Cross, John Durnien, and John Lee of @BoatUS. https://t.co/upCTcMB911"
USRepLong,"This is a reminder that for the first time in #AmericanHistory, the @POTUS is attempting to control your #1stAmendment rights because he believes the government should dictate “truth.”"
