SenRobPortman,I have expressed strong opposition to the DHS Disinformation Governance Board and urge that any funding for such a board be prohibited.
SenRobPortman,"Enjoyed addressing the Ohio Space Forum hosted by @NASAglenn virtually today. #Ohio has a rich history of aviation &amp; aerospace achievements, and I’m pleased that our Buckeye space &amp; defense leaders are coming together to ensure #Ohio remains a leader in the future of spaceflight."
SenRobPortman,Great to discuss the importance of supporting and expanding energy production in North America with @DavidAsmanfox today. https://t.co/1ZLhyZLQUI
SenRobPortman,Great to see that our @StateDept team from @USEmbassyKyiv has reestablished our diplomatic presence in #Ukraine. Thank you to the brave men and women from the @StateDept who represent us abroad.
SenRobPortman,It makes no sense to trade Russian oil for Chinese solar panels.
SenRobPortman,The administration should continue to defend American #jobs and not bend to pressure from the far left who are suggesting we throw our workers under the bus without a fair shake.
SenRobPortman,"Pleased to see the Biden admin and @SecRaimondo investigate allegations of China’s unfair trade practices in the solar industry, which harms U.S. manufacturing."
SenRobPortman,"We must double down on our efforts to spread the word that fentanyl is deadly and help people struggling with addiction get the help they need. My CARA 3.0 legislation aims to expand prevention, treatment, and recovery in communities across the county. We must pass this bill now."
SenRobPortman,Lorain County #Ohio has reported 27 overdose deaths for May already. #Ohio has seen a terrifying rise in fentanyl being mixed with other drugs and even masked as prescription pills.
SenRobPortman,"The April CBP numbers show 234,088 total encounters at the border. If the Biden administration revokes the use of the Title 42 health policy next week, our border crisis will become a catastrophe. https://t.co/Dvx0Mj5tBC"
SenRobPortman,The April @CBP operational stats make it clear that it would be irresponsible for the admin to follow through on its plan to lift Title 42 without putting policies in place to secure the border &amp; deter unlawful migrants &amp; illicit narcotics flooding our communities.
SenRobPortman,There is much more to be done and the U.S. and our allies must not let up in our support for #Ukraine at this critical time. https://t.co/nyeF0LvZMI
SenRobPortman,I also spoke about the importance of voting to approve Finland and Sweden as @NATO members as swiftly as possible. It is imperative to illustrate that freedom-loving countries are not going to stand idly by and be intimidated.
SenRobPortman,The Senate should not adjourn until this supplemental package is passed and on its way to the president’s desk so we can give the Ukrainians the resources they need to win this war.
SenRobPortman,"Tonight, I spoke on the Senate floor for the 12th consecutive session week to discuss the brutal Russian invasion of #Ukraine. I am pleased that the supplemental funding bill ensures a smooth resumption of our diplomatic presence in the capital of Kyiv."
SenRobPortman,My heart goes out to the families of the victims and the entire #Buffalo community.
SenRobPortman,"As we continue to learn more about the horrendous murders in Buffalo, it is clear that this attack was motivated by racism and hate. There is no place for this type of evil bigotry or violence in America, and the shooter should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."
SenRobPortman,Tune into @FoxNews tomorrow at noon ⤵️ https://t.co/C3Ktzr0fGn
SenRobPortman,I was pleased to join @ARTBA yesterday to thank them for their leadership to help make the bipartisan infrastructure law a reality. It was an honor to receive the ARTBA Award as we continue to work together to modernize this nation’s infrastructure. https://t.co/iJRNlWDyV3
SenRobPortman,"Thanks to @SenatorCarper, @RepJohnKatko &amp; @RepJimCosta for joining me in leading this bill. This successful stamp program has raised millions of dollars to fund conservation without any taxpayer money &amp; I’m proud we were able to get it across the finish line."
SenRobPortman,"I’m proud the bicameral, bipartisan Tiger Stamp Act was signed into law yesterday so that we can ensure that every last stamp is sold. We owe it to our future generations to preserve our planet’s rich wildlife &amp; natural resources. https://t.co/Q5mWRwIzhN"
SenRobPortman,The Biden Administration should be taking every opportunity to support responsible energy development of our oil and gas resources and provide relief to Americans.
SenRobPortman,"Today @AAAnews recorded the highest average gas prices ever in the United States: a staggering $4.48 per gallon, a near 50% increase since last year."
SenRobPortman,"I urge the Biden admin to work with Republicans to bring back pro-growth economic policies that were creating #jobs, higher wages, and economic prosperity for families &amp; businesses while inflation remained low."
SenRobPortman,Inflation numbers continue to show a troubling trend. The April Producer Price Index remained in the double-digits at a staggering 11%. American families and businesses are hurting and they need relief now.
SenRobPortman,"This legislation includes more prevention messaging and expands our health care and justice systems to ensure that all Americans fighting addiction have the chance to overcome this disease. Together, we can ensure all Americans have access to the care they need."
SenRobPortman,"Congress should further address this epidemic by passing my CARA 3.0, FIGHT Fentanyl Act, and TREATS legislation."
SenRobPortman,"According to the @OHdeptofhealth in 1999, there were 327 overdose deaths in #Ohio. In 2021, #Ohio is set to report more than 5,200 deaths. The synthetic opioid, fentanyl, is the main culprit, including fentanyl in counterfeit pills."
SenRobPortman,"#China has been stealing our military research, health care research, IP &amp; tech for two decades. It’s time to stop them. That’s why my Safeguarding American Innovation Act is a vital component of any competitiveness bill."
SenRobPortman,"Last week I urged the Conference Committee tasked with reconciling #USICA &amp; America COMPETES Act, to include the bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act I wrote with @SenatorCarper to protect taxpayer-funded IP &amp; research from global competitors like #China."
SenRobPortman,"We must not let up in our support for #Ukraine. At a critical time on the battlefield, the Senate must act immediately this week to approve funding for military, economic and humanitarian aid to help Ukraine defeat this brutal invasion."
SenRobPortman,You can find a list of all the names that were added to the wall this year here: roll-call-2022.indd (https://t.co/fL4dEOM4OG)
SenRobPortman,"This #PoliceWeek, the @NLEOMF added the names of 619 officers killed in the line of duty in 2022 to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. I stand with the men and women in blue during a time of rising violent crime and record drug overdoses."
SenRobPortman,We must do everything we can to protect houses of worship and other religious community sites from increasing threats &amp; I’m proud to have led the effort in Congress to both authorize the NSGP &amp; increase its funding. https://t.co/SmnRnb6WDx
SenRobPortman,They need to meet the needs of at-risk organizations this fiscal year to ensure religious and community based organizations have the resources and tools needed to protect themselves.
SenRobPortman,I’ve sent a letter to the Senate Appropriation Committee requesting that the Nonprofit Security Grant Program be appropriately funded.
SenRobPortman,"This delay would impact energy prices &amp; hurt jobs. But also conservation, &amp; deferred maintenance funding for our public lands, that come from energy royalties. It also makes it harder to pursue the important policy of substituting U.S. energy for Russian oil and gas in Europe."
SenRobPortman,"A recent report has indicated that if the next 5-year offshore leasing program isn’t in place by July, an average of $5 billion U.S. GDP could be in jeopardy."
SenRobPortman,"As part of this Administration’s efforts to discourage domestic energy production, they are dragging their feet in releasing a new offshore leasing program."
SenRobPortman,This funding opportunity includes the Nonprofit Security Grant Program that nonprofits across OH can access to upgrade their security to protect against targeted attacks.
SenRobPortman,Cincinnati will also be part of FEMA’s FY22 Urban Areas Security Initiative allowing the city to access funds set aside for high-risk urban areas. https://t.co/ONSWxH3OLQ
SenRobPortman,"Today, FEMA announced FY22 funding opportunities for its Homeland Security Grant Programs that help keep #Ohio and other states safe from terror. https://t.co/ONSWxH3OLQ"
SenRobPortman,Happy 513 Day Cincinnati! How are you celebrating in the Queen City today? #513Day
SenRobPortman,"Ever wonder what factors impact gas prices in Ohio? 
Check out this video from @OOGEEP to learn more about what sets the price at the pump. https://t.co/hs5y1L41KP"
SenRobPortman,Great news that Finland is seeking NATO membership. Putin’s quest to divide @NATO and intimidate Europe has failed. I fully support Finland’s desire to join NATO and will support the treaty amendment in the Senate.
SenRobPortman,I found it encouraging that our witnesses believe the federal govt should address security challenges facing #FedRAMP to identify &amp; prevent foreign interference through reforms to the legislation under consideration that will codify the current program.https://t.co/3I8gbE1frR
SenRobPortman,That’s why I co-wrote two bipartisan laws to ensure Buy America rules are applied to all taxpayer-funded infrastructure &amp; public works projects &amp; ensure federal agencies prioritize the purchase of American-made goods in compliance with existing law. https://t.co/exdBlKh2Ik
SenRobPortman,"We must incentivize American-made products to create #jobs in #Ohio &amp; across the US, and as I highlighted this morning at a #HSGAC hearing, that includes improving the federal procurement system further and making the government a smarter buyer on behalf of the American people."
SenRobPortman,https://t.co/DyMgq17A55
SenRobPortman,"Today, at the first meeting of the Conference Cmte reconciling the differences b/w the Senate #USICA &amp; House America COMPETES Act, I stressed the need to include my bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act to guard US innovation against threats from competitors like China."
SenRobPortman,"Joined @TeamCavuto today to discuss how I questioned @SecMayorkas at a #HSGAC hearing last week on the dramatic decrease of deportations of unlawful migrants during the Biden admin, which is 80% less than during the Obama admin. https://t.co/9XSHn96eVr"
SenRobPortman,This administration must take responsibility for its actions and begin to take tangible steps to address inflation and lower energy costs for Americans. Expanding energy production here at home is essential.
SenRobPortman,"This week, the average price of gas hit an all-time high as the Biden admin continues to stifle domestic energy production by canceling oil and gas leases in Alaska and The Gulf of Mexico."
SenRobPortman,We must redouble our efforts to address the risks of fentanyl being masked as prescription drugs and ensure those with addiction have access to the help they need.
SenRobPortman,"Through my bipartisan CARA 3.0 legislation, I’m also working to help state and local government and nonprofit groups strengthen our approach to prevention, treatment, and recovery. This includes expanding access to medication-assisted treatment."
SenRobPortman,My bipartisan FIGHT Fentanyl Act is an opportunity to permanently schedule illicitly manufactured and deadly fentanyl. The country needs a robust response that addresses this emergency and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this legislation.
SenRobPortman,"Last month, the @DEAHQ warned of a nationwide spike in fentanyl-related mass overdoses, which expanded on an earlier warning about fake prescription pills containing fentanyl. It’s the first time in more than six years this type of alert was delivered."
SenRobPortman,"In #Ohio, we have seen a terrifying rise in the use of counterfeit prescription pills being sold. These fake pills often contain deadly fentanyl and are contributing to this crisis."
SenRobPortman,"Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we now have a surging epidemic of drug use and addiction in #Ohio and across the United States that has fueled a record number of overdose deaths and threatens to get even worse if we don’t act."
SenRobPortman,"The @CDCgov report on drug overdose deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic produced grim numbers this week. There were more than 100,000 overdose deaths in 2021, rising nearly 15%."
SenRobPortman,https://t.co/VM05W5DKWY
SenRobPortman,"Hundreds of bird species migrate through #Ohio each year, which contributes more than $20 million to our tourism industry. Protecting these bird populations is critically important, and I am proud to work in partnership with @SenatorCardin."
SenRobPortman,I introduced the bipartisan Migratory Birds of the Americas Conservation Enhancements Act. This legislation would reauthorize and enhance the NMBCA program through @USFWS to support the conservation of more than 380 species of migratory birds.
