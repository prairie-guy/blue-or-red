RepAndyBiggsAZ,The better solutions are to distribute formula currently in the hands of federal agencies and reduce regulatory barriers that would allow for the expansion of domestic formula production.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"This legislation would make baby formula shortages worse for most Americans. It will allow WIC to utilize a far greater portion of the baby formula market, crowding out many hard-working American families."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Throwing tens of millions of dollars at the FDA–an agency arguably responsible for facilitating this crisis—is not a viable solution. 

Empowering the Secretary of the USDA so that they can waive administrative requirements for the WIC program is ineffective and artificial."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"THREAD re: Baby Formula Vote. 

It is imperative to find solutions to address Biden’s baby formula crisis.

But what my congressional colleagues have proposed tonight does not address the core issues of this crisis."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Biden’s open border policies are directly responsible for creating an unprecedented border crisis that is continuing to get worse. https://t.co/dxmzo1nfVT
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Biden does not have the authority to deploy American troops to Somalia.

RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Today, I joined @RepMullin's effort to expunge the second impeachment of President Trump.

The radical Left exploited the power of impeachment for political purposes. 

This institution and the American people deserve better."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Looks like Biden's ""Ministry of Truth"" is already shutting down after barely operating for a month. 

This board was a total joke since Day One.

I'm proud to see Americans stand up and oppose this radical board and its dangerous views."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Border officials encountered 234K illegal aliens at our southern border last month–the most in U.S. history.

RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Crime is skyrocketing across the country, especially in Democrat-run cities.

These enterprises are the backbone of the American economy."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Record high border encounters.

Record high inflation. 

Record high gas prices. 

Record high government spending.

Record high crime.

Biden is sinking this country and his only response is to visit Asia (7,000 miles away) this week. 

He needs to clean up this mess. Now!"

Teslas aren't going to save us, Joe!"
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Our Strategic Petroleum Reserves are at the lowest levels since 1987.

RepAndyBiggsAZ,"At least 234K illegal aliens were encountered at the southern border in April according to a DHS court filing.

RepAndyBiggsAZ,"A new Pew Research Poll shows around 70% of Americans view inflation as their biggest concern.

Biden's solution? Spend more."

RepAndyBiggsAZ,"My bill below:

https://t.co/J4Irz7FspD"
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Remittances sent from Arizona to Mexico can help us fund the border wall.

My Fund and Complete the Border Wall Act places a 5% fee on remittances sent over the border.

This means we could have had an additional $85 million for our wall last year.

RepAndyBiggsAZ,"I co-sponsored @RepChipRoy's The Border Safety and Security Act of 2022.

It would authorize the DHS Secretary to suspend the entry of illegal aliens into the U.S. to help regain control of the border.
