RepRoKhanna,Great news. This is a critical step that will help families get the formula they urgently need. https://t.co/CsIkBbGo6S
RepRoKhanna,"A huge win that will finally guarantee equal pay for equal work. 

Thanks to @mPinoe, all the women soccer players, and advocates who have been fighting for this. https://t.co/iN2OyYJKVj"
RepRoKhanna,"50% of infant formula in the US is purchased by low-income families who rely on WIC benefits. 

We need to pass The Access to Baby Formula Act to expand formula options for families who rely on these benefits to make sure they aren't left behind."
RepRoKhanna,Losing a job shouldn't mean losing health care coverage. We need Medicare for All.
RepRoKhanna,"Parents shouldn’t be scrambling to find the formula they need to feed their kids. 

I joined @RepMGS and my colleagues in calling on @POTUS to use every tool available to address the supply chain issues and monopolies driving the formula shortage. https://t.co/u5CT7bv4T8"
RepRoKhanna,"On International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia, I stand with LGBTQIA+ communities in our country and around the world against hate, discrimination, and violence. Let's work to protect the rights and dignity of all people. #IDAHOBIT"
RepRoKhanna,"Gas prices in California have risen by over 20% since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 

Big Oil companies are using this conflict as an opportunity to rake in huge profits while working families suffer. We need a windfall tax on Big Oil. https://t.co/cuGnrNtXBu"
RepRoKhanna,"Nearly 40% of student loan borrowers didn't finish their degree and now they're being crushed by debt. 

Canceling student loan debt would be life-changing. This can't wait, @POTUS."
RepRoKhanna,"Let’s be clear: the US already has the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world, and yet, extremists want people to carry unsafe pregnancies to term."
RepRoKhanna,"Thank you to @LilyMei4Fremont, and the entire city council for your leadership in making this possible!"
RepRoKhanna,"Congratulations to @Fremont_CA on the opening of the new West Access Bridge and Warm Springs Plaza. This project will give those who are working, living, or visiting Fremont easier access to BART and nearby amenities. https://t.co/DIPYdBYYUe"
RepRoKhanna,"It’s unacceptable that millions of parents are struggling to find baby formula. 

We must address supply chain disruptions, investigate anti-competitive industry practices, and massively ramp up production in our country."
RepRoKhanna,We need to invest in a moonshot for renewable energy and end fossil fuel subsidies. https://t.co/TEZFMzVPU5
RepRoKhanna,"Join me tonight at 6pm PT / 9pm ET for my monthly virtual town hall where I'll take your questions and discuss how we can tackle rising food and gas prices. 

Tune in here: https://t.co/vmZCSQEmgP https://t.co/f5KTUQAh1v"
RepRoKhanna,"Another tragic shooting, this time in my home state. How much more suffering will people have to endure before Congress takes action? https://t.co/iqXRO1KFvY"
RepRoKhanna,We need to have a real reckoning as a nation of how to address online radicalization and hate leading to this violence.
RepRoKhanna,Devastated by the white supremacist attack in Buffalo yesterday. My thoughts are with the families and victims of this shooting. Congress needs to finally step up to pass gun safety legislation.
RepRoKhanna,"30 million Americans are uninsured and 112 million struggle to pay for the cost of health care. I agree with @SenSanders that our system isn't working. We need Medicare for All.
https://t.co/h5KmlDQMnv"
RepRoKhanna,"Big Oil companies shouldn’t be raking in huge profits while families suffer at the pump and struggle to keep food on the table. We need a windfall tax on Big Oil. 
https://t.co/qWsBTe9mLO"
RepRoKhanna,Many Americans who took out student loans and paid them off feel the same way I do: @POTUS needs to cancel it.
RepRoKhanna,"I took out more than $100,000 in student loans to pay for higher education and struggled to make monthly payments. 

Opportunity and good fortune has helped me pay off my loans, but I don’t want others who haven’t gotten the same breaks I did to struggle like I did."
RepRoKhanna,"A good step by @POTUS. Broadband connectivity is central to bridging the rural divide and driving innovation. 

Glad to have been a part of this effort as a member of @WhipClyburn's Rural Broadband Task Force.

RepRoKhanna,Once again I extend my deepest condolences to her family and all those mourning her loss.
RepRoKhanna,We must have an independent investigation into the killing of renowned Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. I agree with Secretary Blinken that every family deserves to lay their loves ones to rest with dignity and in peace. https://t.co/stiyXd6IGQ
RepRoKhanna,Caught up with @ParisHilton today to talk about our bill to hold congregate care facilities accountable for their legacy of abuse. Grateful to Paris and her team for their advocacy. https://t.co/yXzoL2r1rM
RepRoKhanna,"Terra marketed themselves as a stablecoin. A stablecoin simply is something that is backed by dollars and Terra had no backing of dollars. To me, that’s highly deceptive and needs to be regulated. https://t.co/v1NVdZg6My"
RepRoKhanna,"Join me on Monday, May 16th at 6pm PT / 9pm ET for a Facebook live town hall where I'll discuss the need to tackle rising costs at the grocery store and at the pump. Bring your questions and I'll try to answer them all! 
RSVP here: https://t.co/vmZCSQEmgP https://t.co/bASJuEVMvt"
RepRoKhanna,"For decades, we've made the mistake of shipping production to China and Mexico, losing millions of jobs. We invented the semiconductor chip, and yet, all of the semiconductor production is offshore.

I'll work with the America COMPETES Act conferees to bring manufacturing back. https://t.co/3F9ZKXDNTf"
RepRoKhanna,Every worker deserves the right to organize. I'll keep pushing to get the PRO Act to @POTUS's desk. https://t.co/5kxZUKhYL0
