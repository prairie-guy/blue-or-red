RepFranklin,I’m glad to see DHS shut down its ‘Ministry of Truth’ after more than 190 of my colleagues joined me on my letter to express our concerns to Secretary Mayorkas. It’s time for DHS to focus its efforts on priority issues like the border crisis and keeping the homeland safe.
RepFranklin,The deliberate disregard for the rule of law on our southern border by @POTUS is a national security threat. We must secure our nation's borders. https://t.co/MlpQ442qJm
