➡️1.8 million – number of times Title 42 has been used to expel illegal immigrants
➡️18,000 – number of daily encounters CBP predicts – more than double current average..."
RepLoudermilk,"To put ONE month of immigrants crossing our border (234,088) in perspective…that's more people illegally coming across our southern border than exists in 99% of the cities or towns in the United States. https://t.co/gmOMeJ4xCg"
RepLoudermilk,"Biden's pick to head this board engaged in misinformation herself by supporting the discredited Steele Dossier and saying the Hunter Biden laptop story wasn't true.

RepLoudermilk,"[2/2] if this shortage became an untenable one, which is why my Republican colleagues and I are demanding answers."
RepLoudermilk,"[1/2] The FDA shouldn’t have waited until Wednesday to announce steps it’s taking to help mitigate the baby formula shortage, because signs of an increasing shortage were apparent in early 2021. It’s clear there was no “Plan B” from the FDA… https://t.co/lnMTdA9InG"
