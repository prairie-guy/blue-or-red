RepRashida,The swift actions by the Administration to invoke the Defense Production Act will ensure that our communities get access right away.
RepRashida,Families all over the country have been in distress due to the infant formula shortage. We must ensure that our babies get the food they need. Today I'm voting for a bill that will help #FeedOurInfants by providing the FDA with the resources it needs to fix the shortage.

RepRashida,"On this day, in 1954, the Supreme Court made a historic decision, making segregation in public schools unconstitutional. Brown V. Board was transformative in our fight against racism, but we still have a long way to go to ensure equitable education for our Black &amp; Brown neighbors"
RepRashida,The Saudi coalition is undermining the current ceasefire. Congress must pass a #WarPowersResolution for #Yemen to end US support for this massacre and pressure Saudi/UAE to peace. https://t.co/oHo7wSAFOO
RepRashida,"The world's worst humanitarian crisis today is in Yemen, where the Saudi/UAE coalition are bombing of civilian targets, including hospitals, schools &amp; water treatment plants, and blockading Yemeni ports with American weapons and support. https://t.co/2LZbAebYXq"

RepRashida,"A special thank you to @RepMarieNewman, @BettyMcCollum04,  @Ilhan &amp; @RepAOC for joining me as original cosponsors of the #NakbaResolution and to all the incredible people all across America who continue to stand for what is right, no matter how hard the fight may be."
RepRashida,The Nakba is well-documented and continues to play out today. We must acknowledge that the humanity of Palestinians is being denied when folks refuse to acknowledge the war crimes and human rights violations in apartheid Israel.  #Nakba74! https://t.co/dLjOALlNKy
RepRashida,"On this day, we must promote human rights &amp; justice. The Palestinian people since the 48 Nakba have been living under oppression and violent racism. Silence + blank checks enables more death and violence."
RepRashida,"Today, I introduced a resolution recognizing the Nakba (catastrophe), where 400 Palestinian towns and villages were destroyed, over 700,000 Palestinians uprooted from their homes, and made refugees."
RepRashida,I look forward to partnering with our State and local partners to ensure residents have access to reliable and affordable service.

RepRashida,"May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. We honor our neighbors of Asian Pacific Heritage &amp; their contributions to this country. Unfortunately, hate crimes toward Asian Americans have increased by 150%. This must stop. Let's uplift and celebrate our Asian Pacific neighbors."
RepRashida,I am grateful for the incredible work of Starfish Family Services and the support of the Clinton Foundation to ensure our children have these opportunities to thrive.
RepRashida,This morning I had the pleasure of welcoming @ChelseaClinton to Starfish Family Services in Inkster to uplift the importance of early childhood education and learning. Access to resources for families to jumpstart child development and social needs is so important. https://t.co/RTMqXvNkwh
RepRashida,"Without access to abortion care, millions of women &amp; those who can become pregnant will be deprived of human rights. The same people who claim to be ""pro-life"" refuse to pass the Child Tax Credit expansion or the Child Poverty Act. You cannot silence us. We will continue to fight https://t.co/xZGatlznDU"
RepRashida,"Yesterday, I wore green in support of Mental Health Month. In the U.S., one in five children need behavioral health services during the school year. I supported the Mental Health Services for Students Act, which provides mental health services in schools. https://t.co/BdofHkBpPo"
