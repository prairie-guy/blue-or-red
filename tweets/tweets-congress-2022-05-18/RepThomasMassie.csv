RepThomasMassie,I condemn the Radical Left's last ditch effort to influence the Supreme Court through intimidation. https://t.co/KAi5BdzLSB
RepThomasMassie,"The biggest loser in last night‚Äôs primaries was @KyChamber.

They backed all of the incumbent state representatives in NKY who lost their elections, and they backed @SavannahLMaddox‚Äôs challenger who lost his. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

RepThomasMassie,"Thank you to @congbillposey for cosponsoring HR 5874, the Restoring America's Leadership in Innovation Act of 2021 (RALIA). RALIA reverses several harmful changes to patent law that arose from Supreme Court rulings and the enacted Leahy-Smith ""America Invents Act."""
RepThomasMassie,"Including the $40 billion for Ukraine we passed in the House last week, Congress will have allocated more money for Ukraine in less than 6 months than Congress typically spends on US roads and bridges in a year (2019, 2020, 2021 average). @TransportGOP

RepThomasMassie,What she‚Äôs saying is blatantly untrue. https://t.co/tjZn8mkTt7
RepThomasMassie,"üçº vs üíâ 

If the @US_FDA were as gung-ho to authorize baby formula production as they were to authorize mRNA vaccine production, we‚Äôd be swimming in it."
RepThomasMassie,"The @US_FDA has had the same impact on baby formula üçº manufacturing as the @USDA has had on meat ü•© processing in the üá∫üá∏ United States.

The US-duh and the F-duh are working every day to keep prices high and supply low, while making sure no new businesses can enter the market."

RepThomasMassie,"When the government taxes, you pay now.

When the government borrows, you pay later.

When the government prints, you pay forever through inflation."

RepThomasMassie,House Dems want war with Russia because they still believe the false narrative that Russians got Trump elected.
RepThomasMassie,".@HouseDemocrats are recklessly putting American lives at risk by drawing us into a war with a country armed with nuclear weapons. Their policies will prolong the war and cause more inflation and shortages here at home, while enriching the military industrial complex. https://t.co/huG1hpte5M"
RepThomasMassie,Thanks @RepMTG ‚Ä¶ why do they always leave me out of the picture? lol https://t.co/BvKLZYZzIq
RepThomasMassie,"@SmileyGnome I‚Äôd suggest there is a provision. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúthrow them out during the election,‚Äù but the voters don‚Äôt exercise that provision frequently enough."
RepThomasMassie,@ThatLawGuyKev What a maroon. https://t.co/b89uma25bW
RepThomasMassie,"Treaties don‚Äôt override our Constitution.

If a treaty purports to supersede our Constitution, that treaty is unenforceable.

It‚Äôs seditious to promote the idea that a President and 67 Senators have license to void the Constitution or any of our laws."
RepThomasMassie,"Lemme fix that title for you:
@RepMTG, Rep Massie, @RepGosar, @RepMattGaetz and a few others have voted to avoid escalating Ukraine war into a world war, against wasting US tax-payer money, against causing increased energy and food prices to US consumers.

RepThomasMassie,"Are anti-war-democrats extinct in DC?

‚ÄúThis is the real story. Not that there‚Äôs 57 Republicans who‚Äôve woken up to the folly of what we‚Äôre doing in Ukraine, but that there are zero Democrats. Every single one of them is on the wrong side of this.‚Äù

RepThomasMassie,Must watch! The uniparty in DC is marching to war. https://t.co/mjtPJEKWyS
RepThomasMassie,"@4k2s33f Make a raised mound of good dirt when planting.

Prune in the shape of a vase (open center) in late winter.

Spray with Malathion (and/or Carbaryl) after blossoms drop, and at least once more in summer. 

Spray with Indar (and Captan) just before the peaches ripen.

works for me!"
RepThomasMassie,@PaoloDiLauro4 I use Indar (very effective) to prevent brown rot. I spray about three weeks before the peaches ripen and then about a week before. I mix it with Captan (not very effective in its own) to try and prevent the brown rot from developing a resistance to the Indar.
RepThomasMassie,"@Chupacobra77 Brown rot is cruel. It takes the peaches in their last week just as they ripen. I use Indar, and it works great."
RepThomasMassie,@v4victoriously They‚Äôre enjoying life on the farm this morning too. https://t.co/YqXWg5EG24
RepThomasMassie,@Chupacobra77 I recommend thinning them this year. Here‚Äôs a before and after of my trees this morning. https://t.co/7kk2hsDNyS
RepThomasMassie,Good morning from Kentucky! The peaches are doing fine this year. https://t.co/ywQSmQOXIi
RepThomasMassie,"Yikes! She should have said  ‚ÄúWe are not at war with Russia.‚Äù Instead she said ‚Äúthe American people also deserve a lot of gratitude for their sacrifices and their support of this war.‚Äù

American tax-payers should not be conscripted into this war, but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening. https://t.co/HYRXnrJQQb"
RepThomasMassie,What the heck. We didn‚Äôt vote for war. https://t.co/zCSKpV766Q
RepThomasMassie,I'm worried the Military-Industrial Complex doesn't want an end to the Ukraine conflict. https://t.co/uJXeGHlzOS

RepThomasMassie,.@RepChipRoy claims he doesn‚Äôt know who defaced my car with a Texas-bourbon (oxymoron) bumper sticker. Yet he was spotted a few weeks ago at said distillery. Next tweet in this thread contains actual footage of Chip applying the bumper sticker. https://t.co/rxOebH7lR7
RepThomasMassie,"Pass the PRIME Act, a bipartisan bicameral bill that I first introduced 7 years ago to solve this problem.

The big 4 meat processors established market dominance with the help of the USDA via over-regulation of smaller processors. Until this is fixed their monopoly will thrive. https://t.co/xssPojNGAl"
RepThomasMassie,"Congress has spent almost $500 per US family to support the war in Ukraine.

The money isn‚Äôt being borrowed, it‚Äôs being printed, and the result will be more inflation.

Wages can‚Äôt be increased enough to make up the difference because the money and goods are leaving our country."
