RepLeeZeldin,"Fentanyl, illegal immigrants, human trafficking, etc. The border needs to SHUT DOWN TODAY to ALL OF IT! No more handouts. No more Biden travel agency. No more rewards. No more Mayorkas as DHS Secretary. ENOUGH!! üò° Ramp up border security and enforce the rule of law!"
RepLeeZeldin,"The ‚ÄúSquad‚Äù just proposed a reso in Congress to force the US to formally recognize ‚ÄúNakba‚Äù, labeling the creation of Israel a ‚Äúcatastrophe‚Äù. They never miss an opportunity to dangerously promote its antisemitic, anti-Israel agenda. https://t.co/j3vL2veBZb"
RepLeeZeldin,"Keep Title 42. Shut down the illegal immigrant travel agency. Support Border Patrol. Enforce the rule of law.

The solutions are there for the Biden Admin, but they keep looking the other way, incentivizing illegal entry &amp; pandering to their far-left base at Americans‚Äô expense. https://t.co/hNvXi7CzK6"
RepLeeZeldin,"Just had a very moving visit to Tops in Buffalo to pay my respect, pray with the community, provide a friendly shoulder to cry on, and listen to their concerns. Saturday‚Äôs tragedy has hit this community hard, but resiliency, love, and pride fill their hearts and spirits. https://t.co/6giO8t7wxm"
RepLeeZeldin,"Tons of reminders, all day everyday, why the Biden Admin absolutely must not end Title 42 in a week, which would certainly open the floodgates to even more illegal immigration. https://t.co/vD5JJUf2DC"
RepLeeZeldin,New York needs to bring back the death penalty!
RepLeeZeldin,"Yesterday's Buffalo tragedy was a brutal reminder of the raw, violent hate on the rise in NY. Asian Americans have been killed in NYC with knives, hands, and hammers. 3 Jews were assaulted this past week in Brooklyn. Sikhs have been beaten up. This all must end, in every form."
RepLeeZeldin,"Never apologize for American exceptionalism! The US is the greatest in the world, because of those willing to risk everything for the rest of us. Thank you to our veterans, cops, border patrol agents, firefighters, EMTs, &amp; others who‚Äôd lay it all on the line on a moment‚Äôs notice."
RepLeeZeldin,New Yorkers are in a state of shock and heartbreak thinking about the families and community victimized by the senseless violence we saw at Tops supermarket in Buffalo today. My full statement ‚¨á https://t.co/gA7pYn1Myn
RepLeeZeldin,"The Biden Admin is wildly &amp; purposefully unprepared to end Title 42. Not too late to reverse course, ramp up border security, enforce our rule of law, support border patrol, increase interior enforcement, &amp; stop incentivizing &amp; rewarding illegal entry. We won‚Äôt hold our breath."
RepLeeZeldin,President Biden must invoke the Defense Production Act to reverse the US shortage on baby formula.
RepLeeZeldin,"‚ÄúProsecutors‚Äù like Alvin Bragg think DA stands for ""defense attorney"" instead of ""district attorney"". If they want to keep criminals out of prison, they should go be a defense attorney. Alvin Bragg should be FIRED...today! Discussed earlier with @ericbolling on @newsmax. https://t.co/Kajk2cfBko"
RepLeeZeldin,"Under one-party Democrat rule, it's becoming easier to find free taxpayer funded crack pipes than it is to locate baby formula for your child or affordable gas for your car. https://t.co/igfghw0W7A"
