SenMarkey,"Gun manufacturers are marketing AR-15-style assault rifles to children too young to use the stove, much less a firearm. These are weapons of war that have no place in the hands of kids. I'm calling on the @FTC to investigate. https://t.co/MgiCiIt325"
SenMarkey,"On International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia we recommit to fighting hatred and bigotry anywhere it may occur. LGBTQ rights are human rights and we must ensure that all people, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation, can live without fear."
SenMarkey,"This pandemic is not over. We should do more than mail tests to Americans, we should be sending high quality N95 and KN95 masks to everyone so that they can protect themselves and their loved ones from the highly contagious omicron variant. https://t.co/tkmZpcy5Fj"
SenMarkey,The USPS will send you 8 COVID-19 rapid tests for free. Sign up to get the tests you need at https://t.co/jFsJsbLBws.
SenMarkey,"As the crisis in Myanmar continues, Malaysian MP @mpklang and I are calling for ASEAN to lead a strong, coordinated, global response including delivering humanitarian aid to the millions in need and opening our doors to those refugees fleeing the brutal military regime. https://t.co/k3MbRUvjpn"
SenMarkey,"Just a day after the horrific shooting in Buffalo, I am further incensed by a mass shooting at Geneva Presbyterian Church in Laguna Woods. No one should fear the threat of gun violence in their place of worship, grocery shopping for their families, or anywhere."

SenMarkey,"Caregivers and essential workers are on the front lines of the climate crisis. @MaryKayHenry and @SEIU are right: investing in care means investing in resilient communities in order to survive climate disasters, support public health, and keep our caretakers safe. https://t.co/vua4Z7Qyan"

SenMarkey,"Yesterday, @POTUS recognized the tragic loss of 1 million American lives to COVID-19. I am urging @HHSGov and @CDCgov not to leave behind the millions of seniors, people with disabilities, and the immunocompromised who are most at risk. https://t.co/mXZ9pw7Q02"
SenMarkey,Using violent force against grieving mourners at a funeral is uncalled for and inexcusable. Israeli police must let Palestinians mourn the loss of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh without interference.

SenMarkey,"Just as airplanes don’t fly without pilots, our aviation system would collapse without the airport service workers who work tirelessly around the country. I was proud to stand with @SEIU and @CWAUnion in the fight for the fair wages and benefits that these workers deserve. https://t.co/6MbB4d3k1F"
SenMarkey,Last night my Senate colleagues and I delivered a strong message to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen as he arrives in the United States: live up to the democratic promise of the Paris Peace Agreements and protect the rights of all Cambodians. https://t.co/hbJUjlG9jI
