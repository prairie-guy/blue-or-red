MartinHeinrich,Happy Birthday to @NatlHeadStart! For 57 years these programs have lifted up generations of children and families. It's long past time we put our NM Permanent Fund to work for early childhood education programs like these. Investing in American families will always pay off. https://t.co/QJEBr7gTDA
MartinHeinrich,"We have to get federal agencies back to in-person operations. Many are still without broadband &amp; need to be able to visit federal offices in person. We can‚Äôt let New Mexicans‚Äîespecially seniors &amp; veterans‚Äîstruggle to access Social Security, Medicare, or other essential benefits. https://t.co/IUve0qfE69"
MartinHeinrich,"We‚Äôre in the middle of the the driest decade in 1,200 years in the West. Climate change is the reason our fire season started so early and why it is so devastating.

MartinHeinrich,"We absolutely need to take precautions to prevent wildfires, but blanket closures of our public lands are not the answer. We need a nuanced approach that distinguishes between hiking on a trail versus lighting a campfire. We can balance safety &amp; access with a little common sense."
MartinHeinrich,"My staff will be on the ground in Las Vegas today and in Pe√±asco Thursday to help provide direct assistance to New Mexicans who have been impacted by these fires. 
 
Get the word out to folks who need help. ‚§µÔ∏è https://t.co/LezpgNbayP"
MartinHeinrich,"Cutting pollution = saving lives AND saving $$$.

MartinHeinrich,"What happened in Buffalo didn‚Äôt happen in a vacuum. Words lead predictably to action.

White nationalist rhetoric and anti-immigrant sentiment is commonplace among too many Republican ‚Äúleaders.‚Äù"
MartinHeinrich,Climate change has created these unprecedented dry &amp; windy conditions. It‚Äôs time Republicans wake up to the severity of this threat &amp; work with us to act. I‚Äôm sick &amp; tired of watching New Mexicans pay the price while they turn a blind eye to the devastating changes all around us.
MartinHeinrich,"I've never witnessed wildfires as early in the season or as extreme as the ones we're seeing. Thousands have evacuated from homes, farms, &amp; ranches that have been in their families for generations. Hundreds of thousands of acres of our state have burned.

MartinHeinrich,"If the Department of Commerce‚Äôs trade probe gets dragged on for months or years, it could crush small solar businesses, leave their employees out of work, and severely damage our national clean energy goals. This has to end. https://t.co/bcI4CW5p3E"
MartinHeinrich,"It‚Äôs past destabilizing at this point. If the Department of Commerce‚Äôs investigation continues we run the risk of destroying an entire industry. This is putting workers, businesses, and our climate goals in jeopardy.

MartinHeinrich,"These crews have done an incredible job coordinating firefighting resources with Tribal representatives, community leaders, private cooperators, and @LosAlamosNatLab."
MartinHeinrich,In Jemez Springs yesterday meeting with the Incident Command team managing the #CerroPeladoFire. The focus right now is keeping this fire from spreading through Frijoles Canyon. We're all hoping the lower temperatures will bring some relief. https://t.co/42lpvPQ2kT
MartinHeinrich,"This solar tariff investigation has caused widespread uncertainty and strain on New Mexico‚Äôs solar industry and the workers who support it. This week, @SenatorLujan, @RepTeresaLF, @Rep_Stansbury, and I sent a letter to President Biden urging him to quickly bring this to a close. https://t.co/e9LgJJyLMd"
MartinHeinrich,"I‚Äôve worked for years to advance this bill and provide compensation to New Mexicans impacted by radiation exposure during World War II and the Cold War. Very happy to see this heading to President Biden‚Äôs desk.
