➡️deliver treatment, prevention, and recovery support services
➡️help patients access medical innovation more quickly
➡️reauthorize user fees, secure our medical supply chain, and lower drug costs"

RepGuthrie,"Instead of focusing on increasing domestic production and supply to address the root problem of high gas prices, President Biden chooses to continue his hostile polices to hinder domestic oil and gas production, including stopping new oil and gas leases."
RepGuthrie,"Amid record high gas prices, Democrats for the 6th time blocked efforts to unleash American energy in the American Energy Independence from Russia Act by voting to deny its consideration. This would advance oil and gas leases on federal lands and approve the Keystone XL pipeline. https://t.co/d8UsWgKRVO"

RepGuthrie,"We've lost over 240,000 nursing homes employees since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. I introduced the Building America’s Health Care Workforce Act to address this shortage by extending a pathway for temporary nurse aides to work toward becoming a Certified Nursing Assistant."

RepGuthrie,It's an honor to recognize #NationalPoliceWeek and meet with @KYSTATEFOP. I’m proud to support law enforcement and push back against efforts in Congress to defund the police. Thanks to our brave law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line to protect our communities. https://t.co/6aClFCrexA
RepGuthrie,"There was no backup plan after the baby formula facility was shut down for an FDA investigation. The FDA needs to act fast to get this facility fully running again, safely. Read the letter: https://t.co/FxvcBzIH5r"
RepGuthrie,Parents are already dealing with higher costs with inflation to care for their children. They should not have to also worry about a baby formula shortage. I wrote to President Biden and FDA Commissioner Califf to express my frustrations with their failures to address this crisis.
RepGuthrie,"@SpectrumNews1KY While recovery resources are important, I am also pushing to secure the border to help stop the flow of drugs and make deadly fentanyl-related substances permanently illegal under DEA’s strictest schedule."

RepGuthrie,The Biden Administration BLOCKED oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. This decision to hinder domestic energy production is out of touch with the financial strain high gas prices have put on family budgets. At a gas station in Hardin County gas is at $4.19 today. https://t.co/W0rZ0KoDjq
RepGuthrie,I had the honor of presenting a certificate to Rico Walker last week at Spencer County High School to congratulate him on his well-earned appointment to the U.S. Air Force Academy. Congratulations Rico and thank you for your willingness to serve our country. https://t.co/unstGfCdbN
