RepSpanberger,"ðŸš¨ The White House JUST announced that it will invoke the DPA in response to the national baby formula shortage.

RepSpanberger,"When retired Virginia police officer Wally Bunker told my office of a requirement blocking him from accessing a tax benefit for his health coverage, we listened.

And we are determined to resolve this issue for Wally and thousands of officers nationwide.

RepSpanberger,"#HappyBDayHeadStart! Head Start supports thousands of Virginia children.

Soon, she'll be honored in the U.S. Capitol. https://t.co/lafJRIAz6P"
RepSpanberger,"As I made clear to the White House last week, parents need an immediate solution to the baby formula shortage.

I've been pushing for increased imports, and I'm encouraged by this announcement.

But I will not be satisfied until formula is on the shelves.
https://t.co/0VrNix9hdR"
RepSpanberger,"To better protect our communities and keep Americans safe, we must invest in our local police departments.

RepSpanberger,"I wrote Abbott Laboratories â€” lead U.S. supplier of baby formula â€” demanding answers for Virginia parents about what the company is doing to stock the shelves.

We need action. https://t.co/D630OzcFqG"
RepSpanberger,"We must get baby formula on the shelves immediately for families that need it.
