RepTedDeutch,"The shooter? A white supremacist antisemite who praised killers from New Zealand mosque and Charleston church shootings &amp; quoted racist replacement conspiracy theory.

We must confront white nationalist hate &amp; domestic terror as an urgent threat to us all. https://t.co/6cYriw644R"
RepTedDeutch,"I know we canâ€™t stop all gun violence. But can we finally acknowledge that refusal to do anything is shameful?

Iâ€™m just sick."
