RepKevinBrady,"Madison County has lost a once-in-a-lifetime leader. 

I deeply admired/respected Art Henson -  as a community leader, county judge, founder of iconic family business and remarkably wonderful person. 

He will be missed. Our prayers are with his wife &amp; family. Godspeed, Art. https://t.co/46Kf2WDFSS"
RepKevinBrady,"Proud to join @RepMcCaul @RepEllzey letter to Texas Supreme Court. 

Texas Central high-speed rail project has no funding, no permit, no approval to construct, over budget, yrs behind schedule.
