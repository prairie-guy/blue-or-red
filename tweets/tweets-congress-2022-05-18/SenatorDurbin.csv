SenatorDurbin,"Yesterday, I met with Illinois law enforcement leaders during #PoliceWeek to discuss the need to provide funding and resources to address mental health and recruitment and retention challenges facing law enforcement. I am grateful for their leadership and service. https://t.co/2j9XgHum3X"
SenatorDurbin,"This week, I introduced a bipartisan resolution with @marcorubio to not only honor Vladimir Kara-Murza, but condemn his unjust detention as well. I will continue to work with my colleagues to call for his immediate release. https://t.co/BUG2RV3XKo"
SenatorDurbin,"Vladimir Kara-Murza is a fearless Russian patriot and leader for democracy who I have had the honor of meeting a few times. Despite being poisoned twice by the Kremlin, he heroically continues to stand up to Putin and advocate for the Russian and Ukrainian people."
SenatorDurbin,"As Putin’s war rages on, I am steadfast in my support for the Baltic States as they stand against Russian aggression. This resolution builds on our continued work to support the Baltics—I look forward to the next 100 years of friendship between our nations.https://t.co/n87G8f32Ux"
SenatorDurbin,"There's nothing ghost-like about ghost guns. This is a common sense step that will save lives. Closing gaps in gun laws, funding community violence intervention programs, and addressing the root causes of gun violence, including trauma, will help make Illinois safer. https://t.co/0oX3crIWbS"
SenatorDurbin,"Americans deserve to know what is in their dietary supplements. That’s why Congress should pass my bipartisan Dietary Supplements Listing Act—which would bring improved safety and transparency to the dietary supplement market.

SenatorDurbin,Speaking live on the Senate floor: https://t.co/2DVYmAvuP3
SenatorDurbin,"It is noteworthy that Police Week falls during Mental Health Awareness Month. The Judiciary Committee will use this opportunity not just to pause and honor our law enforcement officers and their families, but also to take action to improve mental health resources for them. https://t.co/Wv4FANpMzV"
SenatorDurbin,"The decision to have an abortion is deeply personal for every American. If you are interested, share your story below to help continue the fight to protect this essential freedom in Congress. https://t.co/Ty7nW6LYuF"
SenatorDurbin,"Perpetrators committing unspeakable war crimes, such as those unfolding before our very eyes in Ukraine, must be held to account. We have the power and responsibility to ensure that the United States will not be used as a safe haven by the perpetrators of these heinous crimes. https://t.co/K6lwGtOgfX"
SenatorDurbin,The Senate should unite in confirming Mr. Dettelbach to lead ATF with the urgency that victims of gun violence and their families deserve.
SenatorDurbin,"For too long, the Senate has failed to provide ATF with the leadership it needs to help protect communities from gun crime and prevent tragedies like the Buffalo massacre. Steve Dettelbach has particular expertise in countering the kind of violent extremism we saw in Buffalo. https://t.co/5FHp29FJzU"
SenatorDurbin,"It was a great honor to have Loukas Kozonis as my guest today to hear @kmitsotakis address a Joint Meeting of Congress. Our two nations are key partners in upholding democratic values, which are also alive in Chicago’s Greek American community—of which Loukas is a big part. https://t.co/J7ODsQCIbq"
SenatorDurbin,I first introduced the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act with @RepSchneider in 2017. Hoping that now—after yet another white supremacist has massacred more innocent people—Republicans will see this threat for what it is and join us in passing this legislation. https://t.co/hXIIEObqGD
SenatorDurbin,"During Police Week, the Judiciary Cmte has traditionally voted on bipartisan bills to support law enforcement—and this year will be no different. Tune in Thursday as we pause to not just honor our nation's police officers &amp; their families, but take action to improve their lives. https://t.co/pmiD2PjKif"
SenatorDurbin,"Enthralled by Sen. Ted Cruz and the MAGA Republicans, the U.S. Supreme Court once again threw our political process in a mud bath to protect the worst elements of American political corruption. https://t.co/veIu5vLieo"
SenatorDurbin,"We don't have to look far for examples of these kinds of Republicans. The third-ranking House Republican claims that Democratic immigration policies will ""overthrow our current electorate.""

What will it finally take for the Republican Party to condemn this hate once &amp; for all?"
SenatorDurbin,"Why is this so important? Because far too many Republicans jump at every chance they get to go on Carlson’s show and echo his white supremacist blather, his dark gospel of fear and hate and racism. And those same people are the ones blocking gun safety reform time and again."
SenatorDurbin,"The same “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory that inspired the Buffalo massacre also influenced the terror attacks in Charlottesville, Pittsburgh, and El Paso.

But you may recognize it from somewhere else—Tucker Carlson's show, where it has been alluded to on 400+ episodes. https://t.co/8mRE6zLAp4"
SenatorDurbin,"Violent white supremacists are among the most dangerous domestic terrorism threats facing the United States today. From January 6 to this weekend’s massacre in Buffalo, the problem could not be more clear to all those who are willing to look. https://t.co/mQS3DM5Jcc"
SenatorDurbin,"The vast majority of Americans support commonsense gun safety reform. But when it comes to addressing the issue through legislation, congressional Republicans refuse to step up and act. And this nation is less safe because of it. https://t.co/C5RsY8pd2Y"
SenatorDurbin,"The killing of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh is a tragic loss, and a reminder of the risks journalists take to bring us the truth. I urge all parties to participate in a timely, credible, and independent investigation of the events that led to her killing. https://t.co/KkMFrC1OqT"
SenatorDurbin,"After another weekend of bloodshed and violence in America, Congress should be coming back to Washington with one goal: keeping Americans safe. I’m live on the Senate floor, calling on my Republican colleagues to finally join Democrats in this effort. https://t.co/KX873qzDs4"
SenatorDurbin,"While no act by Congress will bring back the lives lost in Buffalo, we can and must do more about the threat of terror in our own backyard. That begins with confronting the reality that white supremacy is fueling these violent terrorist attacks. https://t.co/667xo8vd5D"
SenatorDurbin,"Sending my best wishes to my friend, @ChrisVanHollen. Praying for a quick and full recovery—we need you in Washington! https://t.co/2yMEVKdAdd"
SenatorDurbin,"According to @NAMICommunicate, nearly four in 10 Americans are reporting symptoms of anxiety or depression—four times the rate prior to the pandemic. The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act was a critical and timely step Congress took to support mental health. https://t.co/napoiZNTNc"
SenatorDurbin,I met w/ Finnish President Sauli Niinisto @ the Munich Security Conference. Finland’s decision to seek NATO membership reflects the reality of their 800 mile border w/ Putin’s Russia &amp; the global reaction against the invasion of Ukraine. NATO will be stronger w/ Finland &amp; Sweden. https://t.co/G3JEuLMUgb
SenatorDurbin,I first introduced the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act in 2017 to enhance the federal government’s efforts to prevent domestic terrorism. Congress needs to come together on a bipartisan basis to ensure law enforcement has the tools they need to combat this threat.
SenatorDurbin,"The devastating scene in Buffalo is one that this nation has become far too familiar with. We must do more to combat the horrific scourge of domestic terrorism and hate crimes, including the significant threat posed by white supremacists."
SenatorDurbin,My heart breaks for the Buffalo community and for those who lost loved ones yesterday. The horror of this latest mass shooting should be a call to action.
SenatorDurbin,"As Chair of @JudiciaryDems, in honor of Police Week, I'll be bringing up legislation to support funding for community policing &amp; law enforcement officer mental health resources. With federal/local partnership, and with a focus on mental health, we can make our communities safer."
SenatorDurbin,"Using ARP funding, Chicago invested $45 mil in community safety &amp; violence reduction initiatives, including $20 mil for Youth Intervention Programs &amp; $10 mil for supporting victims of crime and their families. This latest designation of funds will help improve safety in our city."
SenatorDurbin,"Too many communities are suffering from violent crime. The American Rescue Plan, passed by @SenateDems, has already been a lifeline for community investments in public safety, including cracking down on gun crime and illegal gun trafficking."
SenatorDurbin,"I'm pleased to learn that @POTUS will designate $10 billion in American Rescue Plan funds for public safety, including over $2 billion for Community Violence Intervention programs proven to prevent gun violence and save lives.

SenatorDurbin,"Organized retail crime threatens both businesses and consumers, which is why I introduced the INFORM Consumers Act to combat the online resale of stolen, counterfeit, and dangerous consumer products by ensuring transparency in online marketplaces. https://t.co/wfKppVb3kO"
SenatorDurbin,"Insulin was discovered a century ago, yet today it can cost families more than $1k/month. Patients are suffering because of Big Pharma’s unacceptable price spikes. I’m at @RushMedical sharing my support for the Affordable Insulin Now Act to cap the price of insulin at $35/month. https://t.co/mvstn6FXCD"
SenatorDurbin,"Spoke with @SecAFOfficial Kendall yesterday to strongly urge him to consider assigning additional flying missions to Illinois’ excellent military bases. Our service members have proven time and time again that they are ready and capable of taking on new, exciting missions."
SenatorDurbin,Glad to see the Senate pass my resolution with @SenatorRisch recognizing Gambia's democratic elections. The Gambian people's pursuit of peaceful and fair elections after decades of troubling dictatorship should serve as a model for the world. https://t.co/fpQtypLNNA
SenatorDurbin,"I’m live on the Senate floor, making the case for passing additional COVID funding as we surpass the 1 millionth COVID-19 death in the United States. Watch here: https://t.co/8S5WtOIz0S"
SenatorDurbin,"The arrest of 90 year old Cardinal Joseph Zen and other human rights advocates, the jailing of publisher Jimmy Lai, and recent embarrassing chief executive election with only one candidate all mark the continued sad destruction of Hong Kong’s vibrancy and success."
