RepTomEmmer,"Congress has recognized that this bureaucratic regulatory posture on digital assets is unproductive. So, we are working together, across the aisle, to find solutions that will allow the United States to lead in digital asset policy."
RepTomEmmer,"For that reason, I introduced the FSOC Reform Act, which brings the FSOC under congressional oversight and increases the transparency of the council. The future of crypto will be decided by the American people, not bureaucrats. https://t.co/9BblUvXQkg"
RepTomEmmer,This recent history demonstrates to me that the FSOC is no longer independent of partisan pressures and should be brought under Congressional appropriations so elected officials can make sure the voices of the voters are represented in the decisions of the FSOC.
RepTomEmmer,"If Congress doesn‚Äôt pass the legislation the Admin wants us to pass? Doesn‚Äôt matter. The stablecoin report &amp; the crypto EO both direct FSOC to find risks with digital assets and stablecoins - once they label it as systemically risky, regulators can move forward with their agenda."

RepTomEmmer,"Today, Secretary Yellen confirmed that the FSOC is not supposed to take direction from the White House, as that would compromise the independence of the council. This doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case when it comes to digital assets and stablecoins‚Ä¶"
RepTomEmmer,"Secretary Yellen chairs the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), an independent council of regulators tasked with identifying financial stability risks and aligning regulatory frameworks around those systemic risks."
RepTomEmmer,"The future of crypto, web3, and the ‚Äúownership economy,‚Äù cannot and must not be dictated by any entity that is supposed to be independent, but instead takes its cues from a political agenda. üßµ https://t.co/VKZA1OpfTa"
