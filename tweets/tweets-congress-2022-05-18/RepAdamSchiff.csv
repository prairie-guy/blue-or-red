RepAdamSchiff,"COVID-19 revealed vulnerabilities in our supply chains for critical goods – but a shortage of baby formula is as urgent as it gets.

Tonight, we passed bills to remove unnecessary barriers to access and get stock back on shelves.

Babies shouldn't bear the brunt of this crisis."
RepAdamSchiff,"I’ll fight for my Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act.

That's just one solution. More are needed, like banning assault weapons and extended clips, and universal background checks.

We must end the cycle of violence.

Whatever it takes to keep our people safe."
RepAdamSchiff,"Think about it.

When it was discovered the tobacco industry knowingly sold products that could kill Americans, victims could sue for damages.

Why shouldn't families torn apart by gun violence be able to do the same when gun dealers act negligently?

My bill would enable that."
RepAdamSchiff,"It's called the Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act.

It would repeal the law which makes the gun industry exempt from being sued in most cases.

Why should an industry that's done so much damage to America enjoy immunity?"
RepAdamSchiff,"The gun industry has no incentive to support safety measures to keep guns out of the wrong hands.

So we need to hit them where it hurts: Their wallets.

That means passing laws that would ensure negligent gun makers and dealers are held to account.

I have the bill to do it."
RepAdamSchiff,"Buffalo. Houston. Laguna Woods. Amarillo. Winston-Salem.

Five mass shootings in one weekend. Two hundred and three mass shootings so far this year.

It's easy to grow numb to the bloodshed.

But it doesn’t have to be this way – we can stop this.

Here's how we start:"
RepAdamSchiff,"Closely monitoring reports of a brush fire burning near Griffith Observatory. Right now, firefighters are working nonstop to put this fire out. 

Please remain vigilant and follow instructions from local law enforcement agencies should the need to evacuate arise. 

Stay safe, LA!"
RepAdamSchiff,"The LGBTQ+ community is resilient.
 
But the recent rise in hate fomented by the GOP has made matters worse – for children especially.

So on International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, let's renew our promise to be allies to the LGBTQ+ community.

Hate will not win."
RepAdamSchiff,"One million.

America has lost one million people to COVID-19 – more reported deaths than any other country.

It will only get worse if Congress doesn't deliver the aid needed to fight the virus.

To my GOP colleagues: Put politics aside and pass the funding. Lives are at stake."
RepAdamSchiff,"The Buffalo shooting was intended to terrorize Black communities and individuals.

It is a reminder of the danger of the spread of white supremacist ideology.

We must speak with one voice to denounce it."
RepAdamSchiff,"When she’s not pushing the Big Lie, or promoting a racist doctrine that inspired the Buffalo shooter,

@RepStefanik is appealing to her QAnon base. 

From moderate to the craven right-wing, her story is the story of the modern GOP.

Less party than anti-truth cult of personality."
RepAdamSchiff,"It’s horrifying to be in this position again: grieving another mass shooting just hours after the attack in Buffalo.

My heart breaks for the Laguna Woods community, and for every community marred by gun violence.

I will never accept this bloodshed as normal.
 
We. Must. Act."
RepAdamSchiff,"Tucker Carlson is many things — but he’s not stupid.

When he pushes racist conspiracies like “the great replacement,” he knows the risks.

He knows some view his vile hate as a call to arms.

The problem is Tucker just doesn’t give a damn about anyone but himself."
RepAdamSchiff,"Closely monitoring reports of a shooting at Grand Central Market in downtown Los Angeles.

This is a developing situation. But as we wait for more details to come in, one thing is clear:

We need gun safety measures. And we need them now."
RepAdamSchiff,"Two mass shootings in 24 hours, in Milwaukee and Buffalo — the latter killing ten people.

I’m heartbroken. And I’m angry.

Angry that the GOP continues to block even the most basic gun safety measures.

We can stop this. We can save lives.

Republicans just refuse to. Cowards."
RepAdamSchiff,"Republicans want to overturn Roe.

They want to criminalize women’s health care decisions.

And let politicians decide what they must do with an expected pregnancy.

Putting women’s lives, health, and freedom at risk.

We must fight back to protect the right to privacy. We will. https://t.co/Q4nOzCDx9V"
RepAdamSchiff,"The fact that Kevin McCarthy lied about wanting Trump to resign after Jan 6 isn’t a scandal. Or even a surprise.

The scandal is that lying is the only way he can keep his leadership post.

In Trump and McCarthy’s GOP, truth is disqualifying.

And the bigger the lie, the better. https://t.co/oDncD2CAtp"
RepAdamSchiff,"If Finland and Sweden want to join NATO, we should emphatically support their inclusion.

They will contribute immensely to our collective defense.

And their admission will also make Russia’s war on Ukraine an unmitigated strategic failure."
RepAdamSchiff,"It’s really simple:

The Capitol was attacked. And Republican members have information relevant to our investigation.

We requested their cooperation. They refused. Leaving us no choice but to subpoena them.

If their oath of office means anything, they have a duty to comply."
