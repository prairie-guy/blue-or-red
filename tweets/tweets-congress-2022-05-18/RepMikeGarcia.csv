RepMikeGarcia,"I promise to continue this fight until the problem is fully eradicated. My constituents deserve to feel safe in their homes and backyard, not scared of the cartel members running illegal drug operations."
RepMikeGarcia,"The progress made so far is possible only because of the combined efforts of local, state, &amp; federal officials &amp; law enforcement. We must encourage more of our local leaders, especially the rest of the LA County Board of Supervisors, to join us in the fight to combat the grows."
RepMikeGarcia,"However, with the Biden administration continuing to leave our southern border open and characters like George Gascon continuing to put criminals ahead of victims - our community will continue to see these cartel-run illegal marijuana grows in our backyard."
RepMikeGarcia,"About a year ago, I worked with @SaraCarterDC to bring national attention to the illegal marijuana grows taking over our community in the Antelope Valley. A month later, @LACoSheriff launched what resulted in the largest illegal marijuana drug bust in LA County history."
