RepChrisStewart,"Speaker Pelosi shut Republicans out of good-faith negotiations to solve the baby formula crisis.

We just found out what her bill looks like...

-Doesn't force the FDA to develop a plan
-Doesn't account for excess stocks
-Doesn't leverage existing transportation capabilities"
RepChrisStewart,"America's mothers and fathers need help, and there is no time to waste. @SenMikeLee and I introduced this bill to give families the relief they need now.

Nothing is less controversial than feeding American babies. Congress needs to pass this bill immediately. https://t.co/Ri59KDvHzT"
RepChrisStewart,"New mothers and fathers are hunting from store to store to find baby formula. This is heartbreaking, preventable, and should never happen in America.

That's why @SenMikeLee and I introduced the FORMULA Act. Congress needs to pass this bill immediately.

RepChrisStewart,"Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among American teenagers. In my home state, it’s No. 1.

We will never forget Senator Hatch's relentless commitment to changing that tragic fact. And it's my honor to continue his fight to make a difference.

RepChrisStewart,"Roughly 40% of the nation's baby formula is out of stock. New mothers are hunting from store to store to feed their infants.

This is a heartbreaking reality in Joe Biden's America."
RepChrisStewart,"The White House wants to pin 100% of the blame for inflation on Putin and Covid. Don't buy it.

Inflation is the result of Biden's endless spending.

Deflection and misdirection from the White House won't help the country, but less government spending will."
RepChrisStewart,"Reality according to President Biden:

-Afghanistan withdrawal? ""Extraordinary success.""

-40-year-high inflation? ""Extraordinary success.""

-Record-high illegal immigration? ""The border is closed.""

-Trillions in spending? ""Costs nothing.""

You aren't fooling anybody, @POTUS."
RepChrisStewart,"Parents can't even find baby formula in Joe Biden's America. To say that's inexcusable is an understatement.

That's why I joined @cathymcmorris and over 100 of my @HouseGOP colleagues in demanding the Biden Administration take immediate action ⬇
