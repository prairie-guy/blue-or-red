RepKarenBass,"I said it over the weekend, I'll say it again today:

RepKarenBass,"My heart breaks for Laguna Woods and the congregation and community of Geneva Presbyterian Church. 

In honor of the victims and their families today, we continue our fight. 2/2"
RepKarenBass,We are at a devastatingly unacceptable point in our history where mass shootings are happening less than 24 hours apart and Republicans in the Senate STILL refuse to pass common sense gun reform laws. 1/ https://t.co/05Bfs6THXT
RepKarenBass,"As we learn more about what happened today, one thing remains clear: 
 
Black people in Buffalo were sought out and murdered because of a racist indoctrination that has been disseminated by extremists in this country.
 
This was a terrorist act, and it must be addressed as such."
RepKarenBass,"What we learned from the leaked Supreme Court decision is that we cannot take any progress for granted. That’s why it was so inspiring to see tens of thousands of Angelenos making their voices heard today.

We must keep fighting. 

We will never go back.

RepKarenBass,"The mass shootings in Milwaukee and Buffalo happening over the past 24 hours are heartbreaking and infuriating. 

The reality is that we can stop the rising gun violence in this country — Republicans just refuse to help us pass common sense legislation.

So much for “pro-life”."
RepKarenBass,"1,000,000 people in the United States have died due to COVID-19. 

Today marks an absolutely horrific and shocking milestone. We cannot grow numb to this tragedy and must continue to do all we can to keep our communities safe. https://t.co/qOGIipIB2k"
