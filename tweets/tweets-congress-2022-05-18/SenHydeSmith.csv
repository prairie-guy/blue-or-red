SenHydeSmith,".@POTUS &amp; Democrats need to take this #energycrisis seriously, and stop finding every excuse in the book to shrink U.S. production. Until this happens, every family &amp; business in Mississippi &amp; around this country will continue to pay the price of Biden‚Äôs failed energy policies."
SenHydeSmith,"Addressed my continued concerns with @EPAMichaelRegan about getting the Yazoo Backwater Pumps back on track. It can happen if @EPA follows the facts &amp; the science. The Mississippi Delta needs a quick resolution that benefits people, communities &amp; the environment. #FinishThePumps"

SenHydeSmith,"The logic of @POTUS energy policies... 
‚ùåLast week: Canceled lease sales to produce AMERICAN energy.

SenHydeSmith,"May is National #DrugCourtMonth! Mississippi has a strong Drug Court system that works to break the cycle of addiction and crime through hope, healing, and recovery for people with substance use and mental health disorders. #NationalDrugCourtMonth @_ALLRISE_ https://t.co/i3YXKlAX09"
SenHydeSmith,I strongly encourage producers who experienced losses due to natural disasters over the past 2 years to learn more about @USDA Emergency Relief Program. Congress appropriated this funding to ensure farmers &amp; their operations remain viable following catastrophic weather events.
SenHydeSmith,"Rising violent crime poses a threat to the safety &amp; security of individuals, communities, businesses, &amp; law enforcement officers. Action must be taken. Joined @SenBillCassidy resolution urging @POTUS to work with us to develop a plan to combat violent crime &amp; the #bordercrisis."
