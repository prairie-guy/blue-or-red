SenatorWicker,"Seaman First Class John Melton of Liberty, MS was tragically killed at Pearl Harbor. Our Navy recently recovered and identified his remains. It is now proper that we honor Seaman Melton for his heroic service during one of the moments we needed it most.

SenatorWicker,"This morning, I met with representatives from the Mississippi Petroleum Marketers &amp; Convenience Store Association. Their work to combat the CDL driver shortage is vital during this supply chain crisis. https://t.co/upMy9CLZRw"
SenatorWicker,"Rising gas prices are crushing the American people‚Äôs paychecks. With inflation and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, the government should encourage domestic production, instead of pursuing President Biden‚Äôs relentless war on American energy.

SenatorWicker,"Superior hypersonic missile technology will be crucial to effectively deterring China. We need more successful testing like this ‚Äì and fast.

SenatorWicker,It was good to welcome so many interns and constituents to the Capitol this #MississippiMorning. I am glad to see students once again getting the opportunity to spend a summer with us. https://t.co/GrRxAxWhGE
SenatorWicker,The question today for every American is this: Are we better off now than we were before President Biden took office?  More and more Americans are answering with a clear ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù https://t.co/ve66QQHhKU
SenatorWicker,"As Congress prepares to fund the military, I will be pushing for a major boost to Navy shipbuilding along with the sale of high-tech weapons to Taiwan. This could be pivotal in preventing the next great conflict.

SenatorWicker,"Finland brings a strong array of military and defensive capabilities to @NATO. We should carry the alliance‚Äôs momentum and new unity forward by accepting this important ally right away.

SenatorWicker,"Yesterday I met with Mississippi representatives from the @alzassociation. This year, I am once again supporting funding for groundbreaking Alzheimer‚Äôs research, and I look forward to more progress as we fight to end this disease. https://t.co/GiyVVR7M4I"
SenatorWicker,"Drug trafficking, theft, and violent crime are on the rise across the country. Americans feel less safe in their own communities. This is not the future we want."
SenatorWicker,"The Biden Administration is allowing our Navy to weaken as compared to China. @POTUS‚Äô recent defense budget and 30-year shipbuilding plan would lead to U.S. naval decline, with too few destroyers and amphibious transport ships.

SenatorWicker,"Cutting oil and gas sales off from the Gulf of Mexico does little, if any, to alleviate worries about climate change. Instead it kneecaps attempts to lift economic burdens on Americans during an inflationary spiral.

https://t.co/i5FiJ7pN5i"
SenatorWicker,Illegal immigration is surging to an all-time high. This should not be a partisan problem. President Biden needs to send the message that he is taking them seriously. https://t.co/KrsJWyhKaU
SenatorWicker,"Inflation affects our wallets, our grocery store bills, and what we pay at the gas pump. But it is also making it more difficult to purchase vital equipment for our military. China and Russia benefit from this runaway inflation."
SenatorWicker,We need to continue to keep focus and support on Ukraine‚Äôs self-defense against Russia. The best thing we can do right now is give the Ukrainians the tools they need to end this war as soon as possible.
SenatorWicker,"America‚Äôs federal workforce needs to get back into the office. Last week I joined a bipartisan letter with my colleagues @SenMarkKelly, @MartinHeinrich, and @ChuckGrassley on a letter demanding the Biden Administration transition employees back to work."
SenatorWicker,"The Navy‚Äôs 30 year shipbuilding plan is, ironically, short-sighted.  The @USNavyCNO and @CMC_MarineCorps testified that they need at least 31 amphibious ships for their missions.  Instead, @POTUS wants to cut the LPD line.  Congress cannot allow this.

https://t.co/4uFQ5KZLMu"
SenatorWicker,"We are already selling Taiwan F-16 fighter jets, and we should speed up these sales while making older models available sooner. Taiwan can pay for all this by boosting defense spending by $7 billion ‚Äì a small price to pay to prevent war.

SenatorWicker,"President Biden‚Äôs response to inflation has totally failed. Rising prices are a major problem for American workers that is not going away.

https://t.co/ym5e4rC2IY"
SenatorWicker,"Rising crime across the country poses a threat to not just the safety of our communities, but the rule of law and our national interest. I joined my colleagues in calling on @POTUS to immediately develop a national strategy to fight crime.

https://t.co/h3iYeMmM94"
SenatorWicker,The CCP‚Äôs lockdowns are causing major problems within China and around the world. Their draconian shifting response is propping up the regime at the expense of citizens.
SenatorWicker,"Last week, I joined my colleagues in urging @POTUS to sanction those responsible for the jailing of @vkaramurza. We stand with this fearless Russian dissident."
SenatorWicker,"Taiwan is not equipped to repel a Chinese invasion. America can change this by selling them high-tech weapons, making a military invasion too costly for China to stomach. I am now leading the push for an arms deal with Taiwan.

on his Sunday show. We discussed the Supreme Court leak, Ukraine, and other issues that affect Mississippians. https://t.co/EeXdLxEqMz"
SenatorWicker,"I was honored to speak at the National Guard Association of Mississippi Conference this past weekend. The @NationalGuard plays a critical role in keeping our nation strong through pandemics, natural disasters, and international conflict. We owes these heroes a debt of gratitude. https://t.co/qzt8Km88Yz"
SenatorWicker,"Putin sensed weakness from @POTUS. The result has been nearly three months of bloodshed, and the continued rise of already-high food and gas prices. These events hold important lessons for Taiwan.

SenatorWicker,"The war in Ukraine is a stark reminder that dictators take advantage of weakness. @POTUS‚Äô threat of economic sanctions clearly failed to prevent Vladimir Putin from invading.

SenatorWicker,"It would not be a Gulf Coast trip without some fresh seafood. White Cap Seafood Restaurant has been a Coast landmark since 1953, and they make some of the best oysters in town. Thank you for a great lunch! https://t.co/FGqxVqNM8b"
SenatorWicker,It was good to see Mississippi representatives from Southern Crop Production Association this week. Their work to ensure the safe and responsible use of pesticides is vital to the agricultural industry. https://t.co/gVeHX77kjb

SenatorWicker,"There is no question that our Navy needs 31 amphibious ships and a 355-ship fleet. I asked @SECNAV, @USNavyCNO, and @CMC_MarineCorps about these priorities at @SASCGOP yesterday.

SenatorWicker,The severe shortage of baby formula is deeply frustrating. American mothers should have the resources they need to take care of their children.
SenatorWicker,"Today I toured GulfShip in Gulfport. I was glad to see this vital shipyard, and I am continually impressed by Edison Chouest Offshore and its
capability to build a diverse range of vessels. https://t.co/8XtrhNTHoO"
SenatorWicker,"Sadly, this is correct. The @POTUS shipbuilding plans send the wrong signal to our defense industrial base. Building cutting-edge warships takes time and investment. The Biden Administration has fallen down on this priority.

https://t.co/rz16p4LBzC"
SenatorWicker,"It was good to see Executive Director Katie Blount from the @MDAH_Official yesterday. I was glad to hear about their efforts to restore Historic Jefferson College, and I was impressed when I visited the site last June. https://t.co/d32IA6t4y5"
SenatorWicker,Americans are frustrated with the Biden economy. Gas prices and inflation continue to break records. Yet @POTUS continues his war on U.S. energy and wants more inflationary spending.
SenatorWicker,".@SenSchumer‚Äôs legislation would have imposed abortion-on demand nationwide. The idea that there is a constitutional right to abort a child is baseless, and our recent vote reflects that.

SenatorWicker,Every day we wait to pass Ukraine aid is a day our freedom-loving friends have to fight the Russians while outgunned. This should be a top priority for the Senate.
SenatorWicker,"A slight drop to 8.3 percent inflation is not good news. Americans still feel the pressure on their pocketbooks. 

https://t.co/qpEpmpRG8b"

SenatorWicker,"Cancelling an oil and gas lease as Americans face record prices at the gas pump is wrongheaded and foolish. The number one way lower gas prices is for @POTUS to end his war on domestic energy production.

SenatorWicker,"The recurring flooding in the Yazoo Backwater Area is an issue affecting daily quality of life and economic development in Mississippi. I raised this with a senior Biden official during an @EPWGOP hearing yesterday.

SenatorWicker,I am glad to see Finland‚Äôs senior leadership formally back a bid to join @NATO. This is a welcome development for our alliance and shows just how badly Putin misjudged the West. Finland‚Äôs addition will make our defensive mission even stronger.
