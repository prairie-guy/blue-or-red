GillibrandNY,I'll be joining @POTUS and @FLOTUS in Buffalo tomorrow to honor the memories of the ten people who were murdered in a racist mass shooting and to grieve with their families and the entire community.
GillibrandNY,Today I spoke with the FBI about the tragic shooting in Buffalo. They told me that they’re investigating this act of violence as a hate crime and will investigate this fully and comprehensively. We must take action to prevent domestic terrorism fueled by white supremacy.
GillibrandNY,I pledge to the people of New York that I will continue to fight my hardest to pass commonsense gun safety measures and to confront and defeat the scourge of white supremacy. 2/2
