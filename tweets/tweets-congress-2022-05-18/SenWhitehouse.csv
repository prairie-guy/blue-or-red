SenWhitehouse,"This was not a real contest, it was an operation."
SenWhitehouse,"Please stop talking about this as a “win.” That implies something no longer true about the Court.  In fact, Republican senators and the Roberts Six are working in tandem to change American democracy for right-wing, dark-money oligarchs.
https://t.co/7vMHXMkejn"
SenWhitehouse,"And the folks funding that Court-packing effort, and the folks funding Senate Republicans, and the folks who benefit from the decision, are the same folks."
SenWhitehouse,"Talk about a closed loop: McGahn and McConnell get Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett onto the Court, then do a brief together telling them to unleash more special interest money and influence, which they then do."
SenWhitehouse,"Sad but true. It’s institutional — there’s no place in the great Democratic cat-herd where long-term strategy is the day-to-day job.
https://t.co/EBxaodNZ7G"
SenWhitehouse,"Happy Birthday to #HeadStart! These programs have helped children and families succeed for 57 years – it’s an investment in our future that keeps paying off, and generations of Americans are better off for it."
SenWhitehouse,"The Court pretends that’s no problem, while helping the secret donors with more and more secrecy: won’t fix amicus disclosure; won’t enforce spending transparency; opened the door to new constitutional right to dark money for political group."
SenWhitehouse,"This is not a  “one bad apple” problem; it’s a problem of a Court captured by special interests, full of judges chosen by big donors in back room of Federalist Society.

SenWhitehouse,Very glad to meet with advocates from @alzassocri to discuss ways Congress can support patients &amp; caregivers. You’re doing important work - thank you. https://t.co/5lGvGzgCKb
SenWhitehouse,"A great overview here from @RFF on how to craft what’s called a carbon border adjustment – a way to cut carbon pollution and boost cleaner American manufacturing. It’s a clear win-win. I’ll be putting this idea to use in a new bill – stay tuned.
https://t.co/fv1m73HJvJ"
SenWhitehouse,Those right-wing forces spread the white supremacist hate that fueled the violence in Buffalo.  They should answer for it.
SenWhitehouse,"Thank goodness for courts, where the victims of this horror can hold accountable news outlets, politicians and far-right leaders who foment violence by amplifying racist messages. 
https://t.co/uwnVSoEnRl"
SenWhitehouse,"We ought to be the City on a Hill; instead, we’re a dark repository for dirty money. We need to close the loopholes, end the secrecy, and fund our enforcement agencies like Treasury’s FinCEN. 
https://t.co/nMpn5qu17P"
SenWhitehouse,".@ZEROTOTHREE reports that in Rhode Island, 67% of infants &amp; toddlers have moms who work. Affordable child care can change lives and open doors for families – let’s make it happen."
SenWhitehouse,"This is a far longer story of Republican justices creating avenues for corporate political power, making it unlimited, and letting it be clandestine."
SenWhitehouse,"Please, for God’s sake look behind the curtain. Look at who funds Republican senators; look at who funded the Court-capture operation. 
https://t.co/EVfyXKbub1"
SenWhitehouse,"“Ukraine’s recent success in pushing Russian troops out of some occupied territory has prompted leaders from France to Germany to Italy to conclude that a once-unthinkable Ukrainian victory is now a distinct possibility.” 
https://t.co/0yn9R6t0GB"
SenWhitehouse,Russia’s oligarchs are part and parcel of how Putin has manipulated his country and accreted enormous wealth to himself. We’re poised to pass nearly $100M to target those oligarchs and their dirty assets. https://t.co/28bE5AJkR0
SenWhitehouse,"The “dark money maze” extends well beyond Trump. It packed the Supreme Court; it foments climate denial; it funds Republican politics.

Time to clean the swamp. Start with disclosure—a little daylight will get the cockroaches scuttling.
https://t.co/i7hvAMNWbX"
SenWhitehouse,"Affordable child care is one of the best things we can do for American families. They’re counting on us, so let’s get this passed. https://t.co/dppcBIhu9x"
SenWhitehouse,"Want a peaceful and interesting ten minutes? Check out these deep sea images. 
https://t.co/aGjny9Mcoo"
SenWhitehouse,"Watch for more on carbon border pricing. I have a good feeling about this solution, especially as the European Union moves toward similar measures. Meanwhile, I’ll keep pushing ahead.  
https://t.co/b9Gmwhwh4g"
SenWhitehouse,"We need to stop the kind of price gouging we’ve seen from Big Oil and other corporate bad actors during this global health crisis, and help Americans afford groceries and transportation. I’m glad to join @SenWarren in offering the Price Gouging Prevention Act of 2022."
SenWhitehouse,@ChrisVanHollen Very relieved to hear that my friend @ChrisVanHollen is on the mend. My thoughts are with him and his family.
SenWhitehouse,.@RI_infrabank will put funding from our bipartisan infrastructure law to good use improving Rhode Islanders’ drinking water and cleaning up Narragansett Bay. https://t.co/6GTKdcehbq
SenWhitehouse,"Thanks @rikidscount for creating an amazing resource to help get kids off to a stronger start. I’m working hard in Washington to invest in RI kids by improving child care, education, and support for families. https://t.co/ASCBxpUSxn"
SenWhitehouse,Big Republican donor interests built their supermajority to deliver wins like this one – wins that help special interests skirt our democratic process to achieve what they want. The Court’s reputation cannot withstand much more of this.
SenWhitehouse,"Justice Kagan has it right in her dissent: greenlighting the payment schemes at issue in this case ""bring[s] this country’s political system into further disrepute."""
SenWhitehouse,"Republican donors’ biggest booster, Mitch McConnell, gave away the game in his brief in this case - he called for gutting our campaign finance laws altogether. He made clear he wants an America where corporations &amp; the wealthiest few wield near-total control over our politics."
SenWhitehouse,"The Supreme Court’s ruling in FEC v. Cruz is another victory for right-wing donors in their assault on our campaign finance system, and another step toward unlimited special-interest spending in our elections."
SenWhitehouse,"I’d love to see how much of that money goes to front groups to buy political obstruction of climate legislation, but they keep it secret for a reason.

SenWhitehouse,https://t.co/zpA04G7qkT
SenWhitehouse,Annihilating Roe means women with the least will suffer the most. That’s flat wrong.
SenWhitehouse,Even BoJo is looking at clawback of Big Oil’s grotesque price-gouging and excess profits! Time to stand up for consumers. https://t.co/06TQ6OWSSO
SenWhitehouse,"“Tremendously bad” isn’t justices picked in Federalist Society back room, isn’t dark money campaigns to confirm them, isn’t right-wing front group amicus flotillas, isn’t 80-0 partisan win rate for Republican donor interests. Nope, it’s a leaked draft.  
https://t.co/fZshMCV6ba"
SenWhitehouse,"One weekend, two horrific shootings in America. We must act to rid ourselves of gun violence, and we must reckon with the unbridled hate that too often drives it."
SenWhitehouse,Image from the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial candlelit vigil this week. Thank you for your service and sacrifice. https://t.co/rkv82QTUo0
SenWhitehouse,Congrats to all of today’s @CollegeUnbound graduates! Glad to be there for a joyous occasion and to announce $750k in federal funding to create new opportunities for adult learners at College Unbound’s future Community Learning Center in South Providence. https://t.co/lrHsml2GsR
SenWhitehouse,"Last year, my colleagues and I published a report detailing the Republican takeover of our judiciary. The consequences for reproductive rights are dire.
https://t.co/lt4YRDGPht"
SenWhitehouse,"A political party violated every norm to achieve their majority on the Supreme Court, overturn Roe, and impose their ideology on millions who don’t agree with them. How are Americans supposed to have any faith in this system?"
SenWhitehouse,https://t.co/yORtBuuaEu
SenWhitehouse,Pretty good thumbnail summary of “how it works” over at The Court That Dark Money Built (it’s actually even worse): https://t.co/ucUHqUNRxj
SenWhitehouse,"Plastics recycling is a joke because plastics industry takes no interest. They treat it as the public’s problem, don’t invest, and take no responsibility. “Privatize the profit, socialize the harm” is too often industry’s motto.
https://t.co/mzgBqkbsa6"
SenWhitehouse,Time for results. Look where talk and pledges got us. https://t.co/unNyUz60hV
SenWhitehouse,.@RIPTA_RI will be able to run its busiest route entirely with electric buses once this new charging station is complete - lower emissions and cleaner air in communities that have borne the brunt of pollution for too long. https://t.co/HADUyMPHaS
SenWhitehouse,"We can’t tolerate a system that lets dark money groups operate without oversight – not when they spend 100s of millions per election cycle without disclosing their donors. 

Citizens are denied the basic right to know what is going on around them in their democracy."
SenWhitehouse,"The infant formula shortage demands immediate action, and my colleagues and I are pressing manufacturers for solutions. I will keep fighting on behalf of the parents, caregivers, and children affected."
SenWhitehouse,"Back in 2020, we published a Captured Courts report that charts the path ahead:
https://t.co/IFKzhnoRif"
SenWhitehouse,"Roe is just one target for the far-right organizations that captured the Supreme Court - our democracy is also in peril. Remember, this is the same crew that unleashed dark money with Citizens United and gutted the Voting Rights Act to permit widespread restrictions."
SenWhitehouse,Brutal. The price of fossil fuel isn’t just at the pump. https://t.co/KevAz0WY0G
SenWhitehouse,"Chosen in a Federalist Society back room; powered through confirmation on waves of dark money; listening to flotillas of phony front groups; and delivering constantly for right-wing special interests — what could people possibly find wrong with that? 
https://t.co/xSgkA4CuNA"
SenWhitehouse,"To understand how much climate change is warming our oceans, you need to understand what a zettajoule is. Here’s the breakdown: https://t.co/1kYrjlEugP"
SenWhitehouse,I hope the Appropriations Committee ends this harmful rider and permits the IRS to set regulations that clarify what 501(c)(4) organizations can and cannot do. That will make a real difference in the fight against dark-money influence. https://t.co/V5IOKpXlpg
SenWhitehouse,"Since Citizens United, Republicans have stopped at nothing to protect dark money. A big part of their defense is blocking the IRS from setting clear rules for dark money organizations."
SenWhitehouse,"We’re calling on Congress to take action to help federal authorities seize oligarch assets – like the mega-yachts, jets, &amp; mansions belonging to Putin &amp; his cronies – and use the proceeds from the sale of those assets to aid the people of Ukraine.   https://t.co/Byy9KvAfkk"
SenWhitehouse,"In a few minutes, I’ll be on the floor with Sen. Blumenthal and Sen. Graham to speak about the importance of holding Putin &amp; his oligarchs accountable for their aggression toward Ukraine. Tune in soon."

SenWhitehouse,It wasn’t crickets everywhere – I was sounding the alarm on this case from the beginning. https://t.co/ehI0bNEVf4
SenWhitehouse,"Around for millennia.  
Wonder of the world.  
Visible from space.   
And fossil fuel industry is killing it off.  
https://t.co/mbIbSC0rE8"
SenWhitehouse,"He is right. It’s still unexplained how the entire national security establishment — officialdom, think tankery, media, the whole “Blob” — all unquestioningly got this so colossally wrong. It’s a cautionary tale.
https://t.co/wiYH21EzgC"
SenWhitehouse,"My bipartisan CARA 3.0 would expand the drug prevention, treatment, and recovery programs we need to turn the tide of this public health crisis. My previous CARA bills are boosting those efforts already, but there’s lots more to do."
SenWhitehouse,"The CDC report on drug overdose deaths is heartbreaking – over 100,000 Americans lost to the addiction crisis in 2021. This must be a call to action.
