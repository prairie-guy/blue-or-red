RepBryanSteil,Iâ€™ll be joining Janesvilleâ€™s @wclo1230 at 9:15am CT tomorrow. Tune in!
RepBryanSteil,"Wisconsin families, including family-owned businesses, are getting hit by rising costs, a supply chain crisis, and worker shortages. We need to change course and get our economy back on track. https://t.co/Orv40gDT2R"
RepBryanSteil,Not a single vote in the House to recognize the service and sacrifice of our nationâ€™s police during #NationalPoliceWeek.
RepBryanSteil,"In one week, #Title42 will expire. This critical provision is an important tool to secure our border. We must keep Title 42 in place. https://t.co/elUOMt7kyd"
RepBryanSteil,We need to start getting serious about our fiscal and monetary policy. @MacIverWisc https://t.co/Y2dTNdXdd8
RepBryanSteil,Policy solutions are available to address rising costs. Itâ€™s time for Congress and the Biden Administration to start focusing on these solutions.
RepBryanSteil,Labor and building material shortages drive up the cost of construction and renovation. We need to stop proposing policies that keep workers at home and address our trade policies to improve supply.
RepBryanSteil,Over regulation and COVID-era policies are driving up costs. https://t.co/8NTLOKphRM
RepBryanSteil,Housing prices have increased $54 per month since January 2021.
RepBryanSteil,The rising price of new and used cars puts strains on American families. Shortages of key components like semiconductor chips intensify these challenges. We need to streamline permitting so chip manufacturers can build factories here in the US.
RepBryanSteil,Transportation costs have risen $250 per month since January 2021:
RepBryanSteil,"His administration has also proposed new regulations on oil and gas producers. We need to make more oil and gas leases available on public lands and the Outer Continental Shelf, and streamline permitting for major energy projects and pipelines."
RepBryanSteil,President Biden shut down the Keystone XL pipeline project on day one and imposed a moratorium on energy leases on federal land.
RepBryanSteil,Energy costs have risen $134 per month since January 2021: https://t.co/9wpMjLgzUP
RepBryanSteil,"Regulations on farmers, such as the Waters of the US rule, threaten to make farming â€“ and family farming in particular â€“ less economical."
RepBryanSteil,Rising fuel and fertilizer costs have put added strain on farmers. We need to support energy production that will fuel our food supply chain and provide critical inputs for fertilizer producers.
RepBryanSteil,Food costs have risen $75 per month since January 2021 when Biden took office:
RepBryanSteil,"Since President Biden took office, prices have risen 11%, thatâ€™s $569 per month for families. Food, gasoline, heating oil, vehicles, and housing are major drivers. In each case, we can offer clear policy prescriptions to help turn the tide. THREAD ðŸ§µ"
RepBryanSteil,The crime we are seeing in Milwaukee and across the country is preventable. We need to fund law enforcement and keep criminals off our streets. https://t.co/L9TJBtd1eC
RepBryanSteil,"Itâ€™s past time to get serious about crime and send a clear message to criminals that lawlessness and violence will not be tolerated. No one should feel unsafe leaving a Bucks game. This violence must end.Â
