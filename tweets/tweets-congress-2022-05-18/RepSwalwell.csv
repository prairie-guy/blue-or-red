9/16 — over half way there!

#NBAPlayoffs"
RepSwalwell,Republicans aren’t interested in solutions. They’re interested in theater and chaos. @HouseDemocrats offered a baby formula solution to help your family. Almost every @HouseGOP member voted against it. #CommunityOverChaos https://t.co/EDODUp2plQ
RepSwalwell,This! https://t.co/2vDw9wrjcq
RepSwalwell,"My little buddy turned 5 today! Don’t grow up, Nelson! https://t.co/KaZzNbwjGh"
RepSwalwell,"Republicans don’t care about helping children after they’re born with child tax credits, affordable education, or removing guns that kill kids in schools. They're more focused on controlling women’s health care choices through government mandated pregnancies. https://t.co/82WoOpLDOL"
RepSwalwell,"@Storm4Congress Can you really be “@Storm4Congress” when you got absolutely pounded months ago in the election? @twitter? I’m sorry we’ll never meet on the @housefloor, you seem like a real winner!"
RepSwalwell,Our kids are not blind to America's mass shooting problem and are wondering what we will do about it. #EndGunViolence https://t.co/yEBxkBZXAi
RepSwalwell,Republican #StarvationCaucus is growing. They’re all too comfortable with a “let the brown babies die” agenda. https://t.co/zzheaqmNic
RepSwalwell,"My 4-year-old walks into a room with the news on, asks about a mass shooting and it’s the parents’ fault he heard about it? Folks, we have a gun problem in America. #EndGunViolence https://t.co/Yegsfbzgp2"
RepSwalwell,I have had plenty of *policy* disagreements with @DanCrenshawTX but I have never have questioned his patriotism. Just stunning to see Fox News tee off on a wounded veteran. Tucker Carlson isn’t man enough to give a finger nail for this country. Dan lost an eye. Case closed. https://t.co/lZrLhc3WGt
RepSwalwell,@katcourt78664 Yeah cause I have time to make up shit my 4 year old says. https://t.co/7DuEUQvf9z
RepSwalwell,@l_carhart @erikintampa @MSMInsider And nor do we. He walked in on it being on and had immediate questions. Thank you Lisa for getting what it’s like to parent in the era of gun violence.
RepSwalwell,I love the “no 4-year-old would ask this” takes. You’re in absolute denial if you think our kids aren’t watching the horrors we are allowing. https://t.co/MnaWpCRTj3
RepSwalwell,I will not be intimidated by the mad men that MAGA Republicans inspire. Who is this guy? https://t.co/MGg11CwzI1
RepSwalwell,@JeffKasky It’s long been time. You’re right.
RepSwalwell,"My 4-year-old just FaceTimed to ask what I’m doing to “help the people in Buffalo” and “why did the bad man do this?” Absolutely gutting. This cannot be his normal. It’s time to BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS. 
#EndGunViolence"
RepSwalwell,Do something today that makes you as happy as Hank. https://t.co/LrOqFq9EBi
RepSwalwell,"What an amazing eclipse. The @dallasmavs blocked the @Suns from advancing in the #NBAPlayoffs. 

Alright @RepVeasey, here we go! 

Go @warriors!

#DubNation"
RepSwalwell,"Sorry @housegop that the parishioners hog-tied your boy. 

#SorryNotSorry https://t.co/y71ywlLn6N"
RepSwalwell,"@ASDem @warriors Two points: 

1) there was not a mass shooting anywhere near my district (thank god). And

2) https://t.co/hlWfY58N6h"
RepSwalwell,@ASDem You should be rooting for @warriors. What is this take?
RepSwalwell,Who is @chiproytx? I didn’t even know this guy was in Congress until I saw this tweet. https://t.co/LazxJspaE6
RepSwalwell,This. All of this. https://t.co/1jiavPo1IE
RepSwalwell,Thoughts &amp; prayers? Really? Bullshit. Mass shootings happening all over America. Blood is entirely on hands of @GOP. We can be a country that allows you to hunt with your kids &amp; protect your home but keeps the most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous people.
RepSwalwell,"We can have community or we can have chaos. When you promote a false “replacement theory” you are choosing chaos and are responsible for every death that occurs because of your lie. #CommunityOverChaos 

@RepStefanik"
RepSwalwell,Warriors for life. But this is a nice timeline cleanser. https://t.co/8XcaVWCp4j
RepSwalwell,"I have my own replacement theory. If you register to vote, we will replace @HouseGOP members spewing hate. #CommunityOverChaos https://t.co/nNbabUX1Mt"
RepSwalwell,You know why Elise’s tweet is so awful? We just suffered another mass shooting as a country from a shooter motivated by extremism. You know what feeds extremism? This tweet from Elise. We can have community or we can have chaos. Elise has chosen chaos. Let’s all make her own this https://t.co/OeXTTsCMzX
RepSwalwell,The Adventures of Chloe and Chris (at the Capitol) with my little monsters. Thanks Hope Goins from @HomelandDems for writing this book! https://t.co/RodvKXq4Ot

RepSwalwell,"You are a new mom who likely needs baby formula just like I do for my newborn. You know what you’re doing here. You want to kill innocent babies? It’s sick. And for what? To suck up to MAGA? Take a look in the mirror. Is this how you want to be remembered? 

#EliseStarvefanik https://t.co/OeXTTsUnYx"

RepSwalwell,If you are in Congress and propose starving babies to death you deserve to have your name trend. #EliseStarvefanik https://t.co/RuVppxRbPZ
RepSwalwell,Not very pro-life of @RepMariaSalazar if she supports Elise Starvefanik’s kill the babies policy. Will Maria condemn this? https://t.co/CVxUEagtNT
RepSwalwell,"So if I’m tracking, Elise wants to force mothers to have babies. And then starve the babies to death once they’re out of the womb? #ProDeath https://t.co/w8tDvRlNcg"
RepSwalwell,@RubenGallego Do you think their candidates agree with this? Is this what they signed up to do? Run for Congress to help @RepStefanik starve babies?
RepSwalwell,So starve the babies? That’s what we’re going with. https://t.co/w8tDvRlNcg
RepSwalwell,We had to send a subpoena to the leader of @HouseGOP? Shouldn’t McCarthy’s oath of office have been enough for him to do the right thing. What an absolute disgrace. https://t.co/NATG3c145i
RepSwalwell,Today I sat down with @Axios for a fireside chat to stress that increasing competition &amp; entry into the marketplace shouldn’t be outweighed by open-source security issues that could put highly sensitive data into the wrong hands. Current antitrust bills miss the mark. https://t.co/UTisaVfEzr
