Congressman_JVD,As they should. https://t.co/myjGFJemaj
Congressman_JVD,When is the mainstream media going to talk about Hunter Biden's laptop?
Congressman_JVD,"DHS reported 234,088 illegal migrant encounters at the border in April - the most America has ever seen.

Yet, the Biden Admin still plans for Title 42 to expire on Monday."
Congressman_JVD,"Record high gas prices and record high illegal migrant encounters.

Biden's America."
Congressman_JVD,"In February, President Biden's FDA shut down a crucial plant, creating the baby formula crisis.

Then, the Biden Admin did nothing to avoid this crisis or prepare a plan to feed our babies.

Now, the White House refuses to respond to requests, proving they still have NO PLAN."
Congressman_JVD,"Instead of allocating funds to build the wall and secure our border, the Biden Admin is handing out cell phones to illegal immigrants.

This is unbelievable and I am proud to join @RepDonaldsPress on this legislation. https://t.co/tlAGrHFQtD"
Congressman_JVD,Mothers should not have to stress about finding baby formula.
