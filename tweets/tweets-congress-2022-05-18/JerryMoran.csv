JerryMoran,"Proud to see the American flag flying at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv once again.

Senator @SteveDaines &amp; I urged @SecBlinken to reopen the American embassy last month to reinforce the importance of diplomacy &amp; America’s full support for a Ukraine whole and free. https://t.co/2Bgz9Pbelm"
JerryMoran,.@SenatorTester and I have reached a bipartisan agreement on historic toxic exposure legislation. Here is our joint statement: https://t.co/kyB7UIEjMw
JerryMoran,"Law enforcement at our southern border are already overwhelmed with the historic number of migrants crossing into the U.S. 

Ending Title 42 will only exacerbate this humanitarian crisis and create more chaos for border officials. https://t.co/zEVOMBQOqN"
JerryMoran,"@BillSpiegel Bill, thank you for your question. The FDA should act immediately to increase American manufacturing capabilities and safely ease regulations around the importation of foreign-made baby formula."
JerryMoran,"Moms and dads should not be facing empty shelves and low stock of baby formula. We need immediate action to increase supply and find solutions.

JerryMoran,"As I visited with Kansans this weekend, parents continued to share how outrageous and stressful the baby formula shortage is for their family. This crisis was building for months, yet there has been little action by the Biden administration. This is unacceptable."
JerryMoran,"During #NationalPoliceWeek, we pay tribute to the 619 officers that gave their lives protecting our communities across America last year. Among them, six brave officers from Kansas will be memorialized on the @NLEOMF in Washington, D.C.

JerryMoran,"One company has disrupted a $30B industry by using trade inquiries to gain a competitive advantage. Now, good-paying solar jobs in KS are at risk due to canceled projects &amp; delayed imports.

I asked @SecRaimondo how Congress can help @CommerceGov avoid this type of disruption: https://t.co/zHJvoYr16P"
JerryMoran,"For decades, Porubsky's served up hot bowls of chili, cold-cut sandwiches, spicy pickles &amp; warm conversations. It was a place where you went to know people &amp; be known. And be known so well, your sandwich is made before you even made it to the counter to order. It will be missed. https://t.co/iPTD7ltrHB"
JerryMoran,"Wishing a Happy #HospitalWeek to all the health care professionals who work day in &amp; day out to care for Kansans. From urban health systems to rural critical access hospitals, I’ve witnessed the dedication of Kansas health care workers. Thank you for all you do. https://t.co/hLzDn21jUy"
