RepKatCammack,"Thank you also to @RepLucyMcBath, @RepDean, and @RepJenniffer for your leadership of the caucus, @DeptVetAffairs CoS Tanya Bradsher, and our honorees from @USArmy, @USMC, @USNavy, @usairforce, @SpaceForceDoD, and @USCG. https://t.co/h0iZtF98RK"
RepKatCammack,"A beautiful ceremony honoring our women veterans, those we've lost in the line of duty, and our active duty heroes this morning at @ArlingtonNatl and @womensmemorial with the Bipartisan Women's Caucus. Thank you to my colleagues and co-chairs for your support. https://t.co/Ke0XSeJVV6"
RepKatCammack,Talking with @VinceCoglianese at 4:05pm on WMAL. Don't miss it! https://t.co/9jPBC7jPK6
RepKatCammack,"We've never said it isn't the U.S. government's responsibility to care for these children. Our CBP agents are treating these children like their own‚Äîcaring for them in the most humanitarian and dignified way. @SecMayorkas should know that.

RepKatCammack,"""The radical left‚Äôs culture war against our men and women in blue has driven policy decisions around law enforcement, creating a public safety crisis of epic proportions.""

My latest for @WashTimes about Biden's crime crisis plaguing U.S. cities.

RepKatCammack,"Nancy Pelosi wants to call us irresponsible? I'll tell you what's irresponsible: Biden's FDA shutting down a leading manufacturer with no plan to backfill the shortage. While the liberal media continues to claim what I said wasn't true, I made a border trip to show the truth. https://t.co/53aGaCwFDB"
RepKatCammack,Joining @DanaPerino and @BillHemmer on @AmericaNewsroom in just a few at 10:30am from Capitol Hill. See you soon!
RepKatCammack,Had the incredible opportunity to take our #FL03 @MCSOFlorida Sheriff Billy Woods on a tour of the White House with @RepWaltzPress and @FlaglerSheriff Rick Staly last week. Our LEO leadership in Florida is the best of the best and we were glad to host them during #NPW2022. https://t.co/6JwEy1TNNz
RepKatCammack,"""Strong law enforcement is needed now more than ever. With rising crime &amp; drug and human trafficking growing, well-trained forces with committed officers are in high demand."" Read my latest from @DailyCaller as we close out another #NationalPoliceWeek.

RepKatCammack,".@RepAlLawsonJr and I led a letter with our Florida colleagues to the @EPA about the approval of Vismax, a treatment for citrus greening disease that threatens Florida citrus crops.

RepKatCammack,"June 1 marks the start of Atlantic Hurricane Season! This date is fast-approaching and as Floridians, we're all too familiar with these storms' destructive power and are doing all we can to ensure our first responders are equipped with the necessary resources. https://t.co/kZX8vDRjS4"
RepKatCammack,".@RepFredKeller is right. As Title 42 is set to expire in under a week, this will only get worse for our communities. Americans can't find formula to feed their own children, but there are pallets at the border. https://t.co/5JbumxQvVd"
RepKatCammack,"No matter how hard the liberal media tries to run interference for Joe and Kamala, no amount of op-eds, ""Pinocchios,"" or tweets will help this administration recover from the disaster it created. I joined @MorningsMaria to recap my weekend trip to the border. https://t.co/wUGQe2VQ5s"
RepKatCammack,"The American people deserve better, and they deserve to know what‚Äôs happening in our country, no matter what the Washington Post or its liberal media compatriots think. https://t.co/MKek9jABLx"
RepKatCammack,"...one he has created due to his lack of a plan to keep our babies fed after shutting down a plant that was responsible for 43% of America‚Äôs formula market. 

It's wrong, no matter how much the Democrats and their cohorts in the media try and run interference for Joe and Kamala."
RepKatCammack,"üßµ I have said repeatedly that even if supplies were diverted from the border to American store shelves, Biden‚Äôs formula crisis is so massive that these warehouses‚Äô contents would do little to relieve the incredible shortage...

RepKatCammack,We had a great visit from Cornerstone Rocket Club from the Cornerstone School in Ocala! The team was in town for the American Rocketry Challenge National Finals and was the only school from Florida in the competition! They brought one of their amazing rockets for me to display. https://t.co/MAm8ZeuUgf
RepKatCammack,"American families are hurting and this administration is now playing catch-up after claiming it had been all over this issue for months. Another day, another crisis this administration fails to handle. https://t.co/GVAkuLQd9v"
RepKatCammack,Joining @HARRISFAULKNER on The Faulkner Focus this morning in the 11am hour! See you soon. https://t.co/W5OQnxAbSl
RepKatCammack,Let's be absolutely clear: the U.S. would never turn its back on the children coming across the border. What's happened to them as a result of Biden's border policies is heartbreaking and I've witnessed it firsthand myself on four trips to the border over the last year. https://t.co/Fb6Kvbojy3
RepKatCammack,"Joining @MorningsMaria at 7:20am this morning live from Washington, D.C. We've got another busy week coming up‚ÄîI hope you'll tune in! ‚òïÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è https://t.co/LKF2VNZKcu"
RepKatCammack,"On this Peace Officers Memorial Day, we remember the brave men and women of our U.S. law enforcement community who have passed in the line of duty. Serving our nation as an LEO is one of this country's highest honors. Blessed are the peacemakers. https://t.co/5vGHpjPE3k"
RepKatCammack,"Biden told us to ""lower our expectations"" but I don't think anyone was really prepared for how low they'd go. Whether it's inflation, the border crisis, crime crisis, or Americans left behind in Afghanistan, Biden never fails to disappoint. https://t.co/n0Dcq2CI2T"
RepKatCammack,The baby formula shortage is affecting people in my age group most‚Äîmothers who are unable to find the formula they need for their young children's dietary restrictions. This is a crisis of Biden's creation. https://t.co/m4XFnn7wAE
RepKatCammack,"This is a crisis of Biden's creation. The White House will laugh and say ""ask your child's doctor"" instead of doing something and providing answers to the American people. This is unacceptable and we won't stop sounding the alarm anytime soon. https://t.co/6STxWZ60Gf"
RepKatCammack,We're joining The Story with @marthamaccallum in the 3pm hour this afternoon. We'll be live from Washington with the latest on the #BidenBabyFormulaCrisis. See you soon! https://t.co/KSFiICRjOr
RepKatCammack,"Thanks for joining us yesterday, @RepLaMalfa! https://t.co/nQC9v0rg8p"
RepKatCammack,"Yesterday, dozens of my @HouseGOP colleagues joined me for a press conference honoring our men and women of law enforcement during National Police Week. The men and women who wear the badge are the heroes in our society and they deserve our utmost support and respect. https://t.co/W0Mxs1KxZ9"
RepKatCammack,"As we've said dozens of times, this crisis shouldn't even be happening in the first place. This administration claims they've been trying to solve this problem for two months, but we know that's not true. https://t.co/xs8VTHs9oo"
RepKatCammack,Joining @Varneyco with Stu Varney on @FoxBusiness in the 10am hour. See you at 10:30. https://t.co/jjjyYaV1Kd
RepKatCammack,"We shouldn't even be having this conversation. If it weren't for the absolute disaster the Biden administration truly is, there wouldn't be a formula shortage in the first place. https://t.co/4V1RiCyva5"
RepKatCammack,See you this morning at 6:30am as we talk more about the baby formula shortage and the Biden administration's spectacular failure. Tune in! https://t.co/b91vuYGpF6
RepKatCammack,So glad you joined us. @RepHartzler! Police officers are indeed our heroes and deserve our support. We will always #BackTheBlue! https://t.co/BZyzuooA6X
RepKatCammack,Joining @seanhannity tonight at 9:25pm ET on @FoxNews to talk the latest on Biden's baby formula shortage. Tune in! https://t.co/Ti5zG2ci1v
RepKatCammack,"Thank you to my friends and colleagues for joining us during today's #NationalPoliceWeek press conference. I'm grateful to @RepGregMurphy for getting things started while I wrapped up Floor debate. 

The message from today: @HouseGOP backs the blue. https://t.co/WZX9nXSdu5"

RepKatCammack,"Hosting a press conference on National Police Week in Washington, D.C. now! Tune in on our Facebook page at https://t.co/VJPwHn3HT8."
RepKatCammack,"This is beyond frustrating. While shelves here at home are empty, pallets of formula make their way to the border courtesy of the U.S. government. 

https://t.co/0DyFRcDDZd"
RepKatCammack,"Pallets of baby formula available at the border. But on shelves here at home, a crisis-level shortage for American families. This is Biden's America Last agenda on display.
