üö©Cut the red tape on US energy development"
RepPeteStauber,"Last night, President Biden showed once again his words mean nothing by cancelling more offshore leases in the Gulf of Mexico &amp; Alaska. As gas prices continue to skyrocket the pain at the pump will only get worse. This Administration is out of touch. https://t.co/zjIl17HhZy"
