RepKClark,There is nothing more critical than being able to feed your baby â€” that families canâ€™t find the formula they need is an outrage. Thatâ€™s why @HouseDemocrats just took action to loosen WIC restrictions for buying formula and help the FDA end the current shortage. #FeedOurInfants
RepKClark,ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ https://t.co/rN3VvI3trf
RepKClark,We need answers from Abbott Nutrition about when families can expect to see formula back on shelves. Proud to lead this letter with @RepLoriTrahan &amp; @RepPressley to get families the help they need. https://t.co/3quEVXWf88
RepKClark,Breastfeeding is not free &amp; it's not the solution to the formula crisis. @HouseDemocrats are voting this week on real solutions to address the national shortage -- solutions that acknowledge the costs of motherhood. https://t.co/NCPq21U2yI
RepKClark,Our hearts are with Buffalo as it reels from this massacre. How does the GOP continue to allow this? Are they immune to our anguish? Will they renounce white supremacy &amp; those in their party who embrace it? Will they finally act to keep guns away from dangerous criminals?
RepKClark,This moment is exactly what I feared when I shared my miscarriage story earlier this year. All maternal care is under assault without Roe. The @gop doesnâ€™t care about reproductive rights and they donâ€™t care about motherhood. https://t.co/BeUoDkN6gn
RepKClark,"Poverty is a policy failure. Today, @HouseDemocrats voted to increase funding and administration of support services for low-income communities to ensure that every family has a fair shot at success.

Thanks to my friends @BostonABCD for their continued advocacy and support!"
RepKClark,.@ParisHilton and I are committed to protecting kids in abusive situations. Grateful for her leadership and advocacy on Capitol Hill. https://t.co/EAxdVKuoQW
RepKClark,There is no reason that TSA agents shouldn't have the same rights as any other federal employee. Thanks to my friend @BennieGThompson for ensuring that TSA agents receive the workplace protections they have earned. https://t.co/ksxbRj1yZw
