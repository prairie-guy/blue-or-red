RepDeanPhillips,"This morning, I joined a small, bipartisan group of colleagues to introduce a resolution urging the Biden Administration to immediately invoke the Defense Production Act to increase production of baby formula. This evening, the White House announced it will do just that. https://t.co/LP6TmKIoa0 https://t.co/lLXdzcEihQ"
RepDeanPhillips,"Days after a white nationalist massacred black Americans in Buffalo, I‚Äôm on the floor of the US House for debate of the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act and am flabbergasted by the depths of ignorance and de-facto enabling of hate by certain members of our Congress."
RepDeanPhillips,"@HeyButtHead2 While I agree the wealthiest Americans and most successful enterprises must pay their fair share, only competition can ensure the lowest prices, highest quality, and ample supplies of the goods and services on which we rely."
RepDeanPhillips,America is great when America is good. So let‚Äôs turn-up the good.üá∫üá∏
RepDeanPhillips,We just passed my amendment w/@RepSherrill and @RepDeborahRoss to the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act! It directs One-Stop Career Centers to include information on entrepreneurship in their career and training services. Find one near you: @Career1Stop https://t.co/tvwXPExEz7
RepDeanPhillips,Sofie and Henry remind all of us to keep the faith. https://t.co/2WNYtEkbSV
RepDeanPhillips,"The United States of America should implement a non-partisan redistricting process to generate more political competition, not less, and protect voters, not incumbents."
RepDeanPhillips,"Good news for parents and infants. Abbott will be resuming production within two weeks, and safe formula will soon be back on the shelves. Now we must ensure there‚Äôs enough competition and domestic manufacturing capacity to prevent such supply crunches from occurring again. https://t.co/Wbnsl7rkXd"
RepDeanPhillips,Condemning white supremacy and nationalism isn‚Äôt leadership. Punishing and delegitimizing those who enable it and propagate it is leadership. Anything less is weak and morally repugnant. https://t.co/GsSEjIuFt3
RepDeanPhillips,"What good are caps on individual contributions when candidates increasingly outsource their campaigns to Super PACs and independent expenditure committees? What an abhorrent, corrupt, and anti-democratic system the political duopoly protects and enables. https://t.co/nerjOsdrzz"
RepDeanPhillips,I‚Äôm as heartbroken by the tragedy in Buffalo as I am disgusted by its cause. No human being is born to hate. They‚Äôre taught to hate. And the groomers of hate will have blood and shame on their hands for eternity.
RepDeanPhillips,"1. Your tweet is undignified, disgusting, and dangerous. ‚ÄúPedo grifters‚Äù?

2. Abbott VOLUNTARILY issued a recall for safety reasons.

3. Of course it‚Äôs URGENT to replenish supplies.

4. If the gov‚Äôt intervened in the production &amp; distribution of formula, that‚Äôs called SOCIALISM. https://t.co/Kh5RuICxlK"
