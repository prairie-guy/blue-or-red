RepJohnYarmuth,You can now order another round of free at-home COVID tests through @USPS and they’ll deliver an additional 8 tests per household address. Head to https://t.co/c3CucV0Ht0 and place your order today. https://t.co/eemO56zkLX
RepJohnYarmuth,"Mitch McConnell is dead wrong on crime, but name any calamity and he’ll blame Democrats no matter how laughable. In-laws overstayed their welcome? Baby has colic? Leaky basement? Democrats, Democrats, Democrats.

RepJohnYarmuth,"People will say aloud that I'm politicizing a tragedy but in their hearts know this truth: until we stop giving a pass to Trump/McConnell Republicans and pretending they have any place in U.S. leadership or influence, we will continue to see avoidable hate, terror, and death."
RepJohnYarmuth,"We put radicalizers on Fox News, elect them to Congress and other offices. We've even put one in the White House. I've read Republican fundraising emails that are totally inline and no less terrifying than this manifesto, and you probably have too. America is terrorizing itself."
RepJohnYarmuth,"Horrified but sadly not shocked by the tragic news out of Buffalo. There's a reason we don't ask ""where were they radicalized?"" when we see yet another senseless instance of white nationalist terror in America. Because we know."
RepJohnYarmuth,"This is adults encouraging children to discriminate against each other. Schools should absolutely not be teaching hate, no matter what religion you are, and it’s very upsetting to see it in Louisville. https://t.co/rtv474KWOZ"
