RepBonnie,Thank you @Ilhan for joining me in bringing some much-needed attention to this overlooked issue! It's an honor to fight race-based discrimination alongside you. https://t.co/SgGseWLPVY
RepBonnie,"Pictured below is a tweet from a *sitting GOP Rep* spewing the same dangerous, deadly rhetoric that motivated the Buffalo shooter.

I don't care what party you belong to ‚Äî as a public servant, condemning white supremacy should be the bare minimum. Promoting it is reprehensible. https://t.co/CoVeR7V3WO"
RepBonnie,"The operative word here is ""choice.""

Americans have the constitutional right to *choose* whether or not they want to give birth. Let's keep it that way. https://t.co/24VUJt2VVD"
RepBonnie,‚úãüèæ https://t.co/FGegGszpKT
RepBonnie,"I had the pleasure of talking with students from @PrincetonAcadSH during their class trip to DC! These bright young men asked me questions about everything from redistricting to DC statehood. When I speak to young civic leaders like them, I know the future is in good hands. https://t.co/vg6PsBC8mn"
RepBonnie,"Thanks to these court decisions, state-sanctioned school segregation is illegal. However, de facto segregation remains prevalent in our nation's education system. 

For education to truly be ""the great equalizer,"" we must work harder to prioritize equity in our schools. (3/3)"
RepBonnie,"In this 1944 case, the NJ Supreme Court ruled that a Trenton junior high school unlawfully discriminated against Black students. This laid the groundwork for the fight to end school segregation a decade before Brown v. Board. (2/3)"
RepBonnie,"#OTD in 1954, the Supreme Court banned school segregation in the landmark #BrownvBoard decision.

Before Brown v. Board, there was Hedgepeth and Williams v. Trenton Board of Education. (1/3)"
RepBonnie,"On International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia, we condemn anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination in all its forms. 

Everyone has the right to exist as their authentic selves. As a member of @LGBTEqCaucus, I promise to always defend that right.

RepBonnie,"Do yourself a favor and read this powerful story about the unique barriers to health care that low-income Black women face.

I thank my dear friend and colleague @RepGwenMoore for bravely coming forward with her story. https://t.co/F8Hou2NNzI"
RepBonnie,"Right-wing disinformation ‚Äî like this tweet from a prominent conservative activist and the ""great replacement"" conspiracy theory that motivated the Buffalo shooter ‚Äî is specifically designed to incite hate. 

Hate leads to violence. Hate kills. https://t.co/e0rQaDKnWi"
RepBonnie,"In no uncertain terms, the mass shooting in Buffalo was an act of racist domestic terrorism. As we mourn the victims, we must recommit ourselves to denouncing white supremacy in all its forms.

RepBonnie,"My heart is broken, and my thoughts are with the victims and their families.

Gun violence is an epidemic. Racist violence is an epidemic. Right-wing disinformation is an epidemic.

All three have become frighteningly normalized in our country. We as a nation MUST address that. https://t.co/cEVNXATFRn"
RepBonnie,"I secured $1,000,000 in federal community project funding to help complete construction of the new Franklin Township Youth Center!

Investing in the future means investing in youth. The Franklin Township Youth Center will build a new generation of leaders right here in #NJ12. https://t.co/DoAXJvEvl1"
RepBonnie,"Thank you to @PPActionNJ for inviting me to speak at your rally today. A little rain won‚Äôt stop me from standing up for reproductive freedom!

We will not stand idly by as five Justices try to force their extreme ideology on an entire country.

Bodily autonomy is a right. Period. https://t.co/zgOVv2XP7g"
RepBonnie,"One million American COVID deaths.

One million mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters lost.

One million families that will never be the same again.

The pandemic isn't over, but we can prevent needless suffering. Please get vaccinated and boosted. Lives depend on it. https://t.co/RM56AFwk1y"
RepBonnie,"Ending the #ChildTaxCredit was a cruel, unnecessary policy choice.

Every single Senate Republican *chose* to force 3.7 million children into poverty. 

For our children's sake, we must make better choices. We must bring back and make permanent the expanded Child Tax Credit. https://t.co/0EIbBn9vkD"
RepBonnie,"Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) keep our skies safe, yet they're among the lowest paid federal employees.

I'm proud to support the Rights for the @TSA Workforce Act, which would give TSOs the basic workplace rights most other federal workers already have."
