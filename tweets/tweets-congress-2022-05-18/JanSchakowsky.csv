JanSchakowsky,"Going to the grocery store &amp; seeing empty shelves with no infant formula in sight is distressing for any parent.

Today, @HouseDemocrats &amp; I are voting for a bill that will help #FeedOurInfants by providing the FDA with the resources it needs to address this shortage. https://t.co/F3GTKPSlO0"
JanSchakowsky,"27 years ago, #HeadStart was expanded to address the needs of income-eligible pregnant women and
children prenatal-to-three through #EarlyHeadStart. Join me in celebrating the nationwide impact of
both programs! #57YearsOfHeadStart #HappyBDayHeadStart https://t.co/rsa0x58xVw"

JanSchakowsky,"For example, roughly 80% of Americans with autoimmune diseases are women, yet only 7% of rheumatoid arthritis research funding is spent on research projects focused on women. It‚Äôs a similar story with Alzheimer‚Äôs and heart health. #FundWomensHealth #WomensHealthMatters"
JanSchakowsky,"Not enough is spent on #WomensHealthResearch to understand the unique factors and potential treatments for diseases that disproportionately affect women, such as Alzheimer‚Äôs and autoimmune disorders."
JanSchakowsky,Women experience certain illnesses differently‚Äîand more frequently‚Äîthan men. https://t.co/oaUoVsjXKn

JanSchakowsky,"It‚Äôs incomprehensible that in the year 2022, a woman‚Äôs right to bodily autonomy is under question. We are NOT going back.

JanSchakowsky,The horrific shooting in #Buffalo is yet another example of the scourge of white supremacy in America. It is well past time for the Senate to finally act to stop gun violence and the spread of hate.

JanSchakowsky,"This bill would prohibit the practice of #PriceGouging during all market disruptions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, by authorizing the @FTC and state attorneys to enforce a federal ban against excessive price increases."
JanSchakowsky,"Higher prices at the grocery store and gas pump are leaving Americans stranded. Corporations are taking advantage of the increase in product demand by raising their prices for extra profits. I‚Äôm TIRED of corporate #greed, so I introduced the Price Gouging Prevention Act of 2022."
