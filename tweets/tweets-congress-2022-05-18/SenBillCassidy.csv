SenBillCassidy,Just had a great conversation with @guypbenson on our need for an Energy Operation Warp Speed‚Äîthanks for having me on.
SenBillCassidy,.@POTUS needs to think about the American people first. Families cannot afford a tank of gas. https://t.co/M6xEHtQAxl
SenBillCassidy,Any discussion with the Maduro dictatorship should start with the liberation of Tomeu Vadell of the @FreeCitgo6 and the other Americans held hostage by the regime. Maduro must release them now. #FreeTomeuVadell #Venezuela
SenBillCassidy,energy security = national security
SenBillCassidy,We need an Energy Operation Warp Speed for domestic energy production.
SenBillCassidy,"Mr. President, if you're listening, think about the American people first. We need an Energy Operation Warp Speed to lower prices at the pump. https://t.co/2PVKBc7zUg"
SenBillCassidy,Keep Title 42 in place. Secure the border.
SenBillCassidy,"This administration's radical open-border agenda is putting Americans in harm's way.

SenBillCassidy,Great meeting. Totally agree we need a North American energy security strategy. A strong US-Canada partnership is how we get it done. https://t.co/FGVe08Am5S
SenBillCassidy,President Biden‚Äôs administration is actively making high gas prices worse. https://t.co/mKgdCDFxIf
SenBillCassidy,Clearly huge demand for Louisiana LNG at home and abroad. We need to unleash American energy production. That starts with an Energy Operation Warp Speed. https://t.co/lORKFzQE6y
SenBillCassidy,We need to address crime. This sends that message. https://t.co/lXAADiw7f5
SenBillCassidy,NEW: Securing our own homeland should always be a top priority. We can secure the border and take steps to stop Putin at the same time. https://t.co/bWM037j2xw
SenBillCassidy,"If there was ever a time that the American people want to know that the president &amp; Congress are working together to defeat the scourge of crime, the time is now. 

This resolution is to send the message that combating crime is what we are focused on. https://t.co/tmpzD2Dfa9"
SenBillCassidy,There still is a crisis at the border.
SenBillCassidy,Hearts break for those families in Buffalo and for the greater community. The wrongness of this killing and the hate which inspired it is so awful. It‚Äôs up to each of us to replace hate with love.

SenBillCassidy,"Joined @RuthlessPodcast this week to talk about unleashing US energy, #schoolchoice, &amp; crawfish boils‚Äîtune in."
SenBillCassidy,"This is telling the Biden administration the obvious, but it appears they need to be told the obvious."
SenBillCassidy,"This is another example of government regulation &amp; logistical incompetence, now leading to #formulashortages for American families. The Biden administration needs to cut the red tape &amp; prioritize areas with shortages."
