192 Republicans voted no. They voted against baby formula. https://t.co/mrxWc3AClq"
RepMcGovern,@JPJones1812 This is an ‚ú®entire thread ‚ú®about things we are doing to fix it.
RepMcGovern,"Next, tonight, @HouseDemocrats will vote on an additional emergency measure to provide urgently-needed flexibility so low-income parents can purchase safe formula with their WIC benefits during these extenuating circumstances.

I hope this bill gets strong bipartisan support."
RepMcGovern,"Meanwhile, @POTUS Biden &amp; the @WhiteHouse are taking swift, decisive, coordinated steps on behalf of parents‚Äîinvoking the Defense Production Act, launching Operation Fly Formula to import safe products rapidly &amp; working directly with producers to get formula on the shelf ASAP. https://t.co/S7t9EaiN03"

Yesterday, as Chairman of the Rules Committee, I helped advance an emergency bill to address the formula shortage. https://t.co/xqyMhBhC1m"

RepMcGovern,"Shell just made $9.1 billion in quarterly profits. Exxon Mobil &amp; Chevron brag about enriching their shareholders.

Yet the GOP won't say a single bad word about big oil‚Äîthey‚Äôd rather defend corporate price gouging &amp; blame President Biden than work with us to solve problems. https://t.co/Qr9KTJvZmr"
