SenMikeLee,The ESG movement’s primary goal is to force divestment from fossil fuels. No investment in energy = higher prices. That's what they want. This woke crusade is hurting Americans every time they go to the gas pump or flick the light switch. https://t.co/xmjlhtKg4V
SenMikeLee,Feeding American babies should be the least controversial of issues. My FORMULA Act can help fix the formula crisis and make sure that American families can take care of their infants. https://t.co/XVlYSdkU59

SenMikeLee,American babies are going hungry and the federal government is standing in the way. My FORMULA Act will give these families relief during this unprecedented shortage. Congress needs to pass this bill immediately to protect American babies from going hungry. https://t.co/qn6rJ9jlIB
SenMikeLee,"Happy #NationalPoliceWeek! I had the pleasure of meeting with some of Herriman’s finest. To the law enforcement throughout Utah and all across America, thank you for keeping us safe. @HerrimanPolice https://t.co/BGjLr8RoYp"
SenMikeLee,"Judge Griffith makes a compelling case for the independence and integrity of the federal judiciary. The Supreme Court is not a partisan body. Attempts to apply political pressure and threats to pack the Court are wrong.

SenMikeLee,I am thrilled the House has passed my RECA extension. This bill’s passage is a statement saying the United States government is not abandoning the victims and communities harmed by the early atomic program. @POTUS should sign the bill as soon as possible. https://t.co/XUTfctjSrC
SenMikeLee,"I wish my friend, @GovCox, a swift recovery. https://t.co/QcxDSkHubU"
SenMikeLee,.@RioTinto is a leading company in Utah and a major player in our nation's critical mineral supply chain. I met with CEO Jakob Stausholm today and congratulated Rio Tinto for its new investments at @kennecottutah. https://t.co/0h6d3pjUpm
SenMikeLee,"As gas prices hit an all-time high in the USA, @POTUS cancelled a vital round of oil and gas lease sales this morning. High gas prices are preventable. Democrats are putting woke politics ahead of American families.
