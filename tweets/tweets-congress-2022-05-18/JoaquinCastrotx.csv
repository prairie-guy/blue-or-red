JoaquinCastrotx,"@PeteTucker @DayvonLove Excellent article and investigation.
Texas‚Äô statewide elected officials are Exhibit A for getting away with corruption/cronyism yet almost never get criminally investigated. And the AG, Ken Paxton, who was indicted hasn‚Äôt gone to trial for seven years."
JoaquinCastrotx,"Like many families in San Antonio &amp; across the country, my wife and I understand how nerve-wracking this formula shortage is.
¬†
I voted to help WIC-enrolled families access safe formula products, provide @US_FDA w/resources to #FeedOurInfants &amp; ensure this never happens again. https://t.co/DDzevARAyB"
JoaquinCastrotx,"I've been leading the call for President Biden to invoke the Defense Production Act to solve our nation's formula shortage, and I'm relieved to see today's news from the administration. Families are suffering and we need to bring this shortage to an end. https://t.co/bihhEOYoYn"
JoaquinCastrotx,"Toxic exposure is a devastating and unacceptable cost of war.
¬†
As a cosponsor of the House-passed Honoring Our PACT Act, I‚Äôm glad to see the Senate reach a bipartisan agreement.

I look forward to getting this bill to @POTUS‚Äôs desk &amp; providing veterans the care they deserve. https://t.co/h4p5dZyvIS"
JoaquinCastrotx,"TEXAS WIC UPDATE:

Due to the formula recall, many Texans are struggling to find approved powdered formulas. WIC has temporarily expanded its list to include additional formulas so you can get formula for your baby without updating your card.

JoaquinCastrotx,"As we recover from the pandemic, Texans deserve an economy that works for everyone.
¬†
Today, the House voted to pass my legislation to fund workforce development programs like @ProjectQuestInc &amp; expand career services that help domestic violence survivors rebuild their lives. https://t.co/Tn6ovh4Oo5"
JoaquinCastrotx,"Trump-era restrictions on remittances, travel &amp; immigration visas have hurt Cuban-Americans &amp; their families in Cuba and hurt our national security.

I have long called for these restrictions to be lifted, and I'm glad to see the administration continue to re-engage with Cuba. https://t.co/frgzXVxUVH"
JoaquinCastrotx,"No one should fear for their life in a place of worship. We must do all we can to keep these sacred places safe. FEMA security grants can stop terror attacks, but @GovAbbott closed applications early. Today, I joined my TX colleagues to demand he correct this disastrous decision. https://t.co/Tqirf49EQd"
JoaquinCastrotx,"Today, @RepJohnLarson and I led 149 of our House colleagues in urging the Biden administration to use every tool at their disposal to help manufacturers end the infant formula shortage.

Babies should not go hungry. This is a life-or-death issue and must be fixed now. https://t.co/japyZFy0IC"
JoaquinCastrotx,"In the early days of the Ukraine conflict, I met with members of Ukrainian San Antonio to hear their stories and share my support for their homeland.

I'm glad to see their Homestead exhibit on display at Igo Library to help San Antonians learn about Ukrainian history &amp; culture. https://t.co/TOhxZaIHcq"
JoaquinCastrotx,"I look forward to the positive results of today‚Äôs hearing, and thank @RepAdamSchiff and @RepAndreCarson for their work to make this discussion public and accessible."
JoaquinCastrotx,"Last year, I voted to require the Intelligence Community to produce a semiannual report on UAP. The first report is due in October, and I will push for it to be declassified to the greatest extent possible."
JoaquinCastrotx,"1) What is DOD‚Äôs process for identifying UAP?
2) After the Intelligence Community‚Äôs UAP Task Force concludes current investigations, what information will be made public?
3) What capabilities do we need to better detect UAP?
4) What threat do UAP pose to our national security?"
JoaquinCastrotx,"During today‚Äôs hearing, committee members will hear testimony about UAP from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security and the Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence. 

Here‚Äôs what I want to know üëá"
JoaquinCastrotx,"Today, @HouseIntel is holding a hearing on the potential risks of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), sometimes called UFOs.

For generations, lack of government transparency about UAP has bred conspiracy theories &amp; suspicion. This hearing is an important step to rebuild trust. https://t.co/IolOjct8iq"
JoaquinCastrotx,Political hate speech sold under the banner of religion. https://t.co/fiBs07Q5ss
JoaquinCastrotx,"Veronica‚Äôs Boutique by @CathCharitiesSA is currently out of formula but is taking down the contact information of parents in need. They will follow up once more is in stock.

To be added to their waitlist, call: (210) 226-6178.

JoaquinCastrotx,"This time it was Buffalo‚Äôs black community. So many communities ‚Äî African-American, Latino, Asian-American, Jewish, Muslim ‚Äî have seen a rise in hate crimes against them, including murder, because of this hate media and speech that has intensified over the past several years."
JoaquinCastrotx,My heart goes out to the victims‚Äô families in Buffalo. Another community has paid the price for hate media &amp; speech. Before El Paso the Trump campaign ran thousands of ads re: immigrants as invaders. Before Buffalo right wing pundits/politicians sold the Great Replacement Theory. https://t.co/rjIQnIPg0Y
JoaquinCastrotx,And it‚Äôs only mid-May. Do you know how hot it gets in Texas in July? Cc:@GovAbbott https://t.co/1qwUNFaoal
JoaquinCastrotx,"I condemn the violence by the Israeli police at Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh‚Äôs funeral.

There must be an independent investigation into her murder and those responsible must be brought to justice. https://t.co/rBGNlvdTK8"
JoaquinCastrotx,Why don‚Äôt you just try to keep the lights on in Texas this weekend? https://t.co/bZlmOLCzDa
JoaquinCastrotx,"The government &amp; U.S. manufacturers need to work together to get baby formula back on shelves. 

The House is expected to vote soon on a bill to address this crisis and I‚Äôm calling on @POTUS to use the Defense Production Act to speed up formula production.
https://t.co/OtHMSToLab"
JoaquinCastrotx,"If @GovAbbott wants to help with the baby formula shortage he should redirect the billions he‚Äôs spending on the scandalous, failed ‚ÄúOperation Lone Star‚Äù and figure out a way to get more baby formula to Texas. In other words, do something useful for a change."
JoaquinCastrotx,"As the father of a newborn, I‚Äôm struck by Greg Abbott‚Äôs callous inhumanity. Governor, the government provides baby formula because these babies are being held in government custody and unable to shop HEB or Walmart for formula. All you do is divide people with fear. 1/2 https://t.co/pvD9E2KyBb"
JoaquinCastrotx,@LAT_Iliana @latimes @AWSM_SportMedia @NAHJ Congrats!
JoaquinCastrotx,"I‚Äôm thrilled that @POTUS signed into law the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act, a bill I‚Äôve worked on for several years.

Nonprofit entities, like @UTSA, can now work more closely w/ @DHSgov to address cybersecurity risks &amp; incidents at the state &amp; local levels."
