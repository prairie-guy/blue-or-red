RonWyden,Kudos to the @USWNT for its dedication and hard work to achieve this long-overdue goal. https://t.co/qry8syp7D3
RonWyden,Republicans have spent decades slashing the IRS budget to make it easier for their wealthy donors to get away with gaming the system. This is exactly why I'm fighting tooth and nail for robust IRS funding so it can go after wealthy tax cheats. https://t.co/rdScvYWi1u
RonWyden,Every person in America using a period tracking app should be concerned about how their data could be weaponized against them if Roe is overturned. It's absolutely essential that Congress protects Americans' data from shady brokers once and for all. https://t.co/yDWruimWGY
RonWyden,.@SenBooker @SenMarkey @SenAlexPadilla and I will continue pushing regulators to get to the bottom of this and protect American consumers.
RonWyden,I'm urging the FTC to investigate whether https://t.co/3eARxS4PWr lied to consumers and government agencies about its facial recognition software. Americans shouldn't have to compromise their privacy to access essential government services. https://t.co/l0C1u1VaZ2
RonWyden,Families are struggling to find formula to feed their babies while Abbott is reaping the windfall of Republicans’ tax cuts and allowing infant formula plants to crumble. Today I'm launching an investigation into Abbott's tax-dodging and reckless spending on stock buybacks. https://t.co/1fGcmmTnrw
RonWyden,"This is an important first step in changing our country’s outdated, harmful policy of isolation. I’ll continue pushing my legislation in Congress to establish normal trade relations with Cuba, which is key to charting a new diplomatic course. https://t.co/YOH1zVrGxB"
RonWyden,"Decades of Fox News and conservative propaganda have empowered white supremacists to carry out their manifesto of hatred, bigotry, and violence. White supremacy has no place in America. We must be united in our battle to defeat it. https://t.co/IDyDn1Ub2W"
RonWyden,Donald Trump’s SCOTUS appointees just shredded a critical anticorruption law to allow candidates to pocket their campaign donations. The Supreme Court just legalized bribery. https://t.co/47dLgQsLO2
RonWyden,Every American is eligible to receive 8 free at-home COVID tests. Keep yourself and your loved ones safe. Order yours today: https://t.co/4vHEW8slPn
RonWyden,The national formula shortage is putting countless kids and families at risk. I joined my colleagues in pressing formula manufacturers to increase production and get formula back on shelves as soon as possible. https://t.co/B1KZYmxv4b
RonWyden,"Great to see Oregon hoops in the #NBAPlayoffs spotlight w/Jefferson’s Ime Udoka &amp; Jesuit’s Erik Spoelstra coaching, and West Linn’s Payton Pritchard playing in the Eastern Conference Finals. Looking forward to next year in #RipCity w/Dame back &amp; some good #NBADraftLottery fortune"
RonWyden,Congrats to the women &amp; men of @OregonTF on sweeping the @pac12 titles at Hayward Field. #GoDucks
RonWyden,Wishing my friend @ChrisVanHollen a speedy recovery. I look forward to continuing our important work for American families. https://t.co/LvCndv9AtA
RonWyden,"Racial hatred and lax gun laws added up to a toxic combination yet again with lethal consequences for innocent people in Buffalo and their now-grieving loved ones. Plain and simple, this is domestic terrorism fueled by gun access that’s far too easy."
RonWyden,Three cheers for Oregon beers! https://t.co/eAgnT5zuQV -
RonWyden,"I yam thrilled to hear this spud-tacular news for Oregon’s potato farmers, whose product will be the next shipment going to Mexico. Kudos to the Biden administration for this tater-ly awesome plan to help American farmers access Mexico’s markets. https://t.co/d14xWpbyZf"
RonWyden,It's past time Congress get to work taxing stock buybacks and make companies think twice before putting shareholders ahead of American families. I have the bill for that.
RonWyden,"Corporate greed is at the heart of the baby formula crisis America's parents are facing. Just five months ago one of the leading manufacturers of baby formula — Abbott — spent $5 billion on stock buybacks for wealthy shareholders, despite safety and production issues."
RonWyden,I strongly support this innovative proposal by the @FCC &amp; @JRosenworcelFCC to create equal opportunity for rural students in Oregon &amp; nationwide. Wi-fi on school buses can be a huge help in reducing the homework gap facing students on longer rural routes. https://t.co/vKqu3dNHR6
RonWyden,"With this champion for Americans' privacy confirmed, the FTC can finally get to work protecting Americans' privacy and holding bad actors accountable. https://t.co/5g94Dub1DJ"
RonWyden,"If you're a woman in America, there's a real chance your data could be weaponized against you if you get an abortion. Republicans want nothing more than a dystopian state of uterus surveillance. That’s what’s coming unless Congress protects Americans' constitutional rights."
