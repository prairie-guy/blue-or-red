RepJerryNadler,"Our nation’s founders left it up to all of us—including those of us in Congress—to act as guardians against assault on our constitutional order. That means we must reform the National Emergencies Act to ensure that future abuse will not occur.
https://t.co/gfKD2FDuNC"
RepJerryNadler,"We may agree that the president should be allowed some types of discretion during true emergencies, but an emergency cannot continue in perpetuity. So, to shift the burden of inertia, we must set a time limit for emergencies."
RepJerryNadler,"This is deeply problematic, given the numerous powers a president can exercise upon issuing an emergency declaration. 

Even more problematic is that the president need not show any relationship between the declared emergency and the statutory provision being invoked."
RepJerryNadler,"Since 1976, when Congress passed the National Emergencies Act, U.S. Presidents have declared the existence of 75 national emergencies, justifying their potential exercise of emergency powers. Of those 75 declarations, more than 40 remain in effect. https://t.co/OsHcpclNAd"

It will force the FAA to work with local officials and advocates to create a plan to cut down on non-essential flights."
RepJerryNadler,"Today I joined @RepMaloney at a press conference to discuss our Helicopter Safety and Noise Management Act.
