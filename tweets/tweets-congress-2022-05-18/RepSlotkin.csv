RepSlotkin,"Here in Congress, we’re the ones who write the laws, and that means we’re responsible for rising above partisan politics to find bipartisan solutions. I’m urging the Democratic leadership to take up this legislation so we can get to the root of the problem &amp; pass real reform. 4/4"
RepSlotkin,"And because these surges are exacerbated by human smugglers, the Border Security and Migrant Safety Act requires our cooperation with neighboring countries to crack down on transnational criminal groups taking advantage of the current situation. 3/4"
RepSlotkin,"We need to treat the crisis at the southern border like we do natural disasters – with a swift, whole-of-government approach. The Emergency Migration Response Act increases cooperation between federal agencies so we can speed resources, medical care &amp; personnel to the border. 2/4"
RepSlotkin,Our immigration system has been broken through multiple administrations – Democrat &amp; Republican. That’s why I’m teaming up with @RepTonyGonzales to introduce 2 bills that overhaul our response to migration surges &amp; crack down on illegal human trafficking. https://t.co/byxbdSEutb
RepSlotkin,I’ve met far too many Michigan veterans who have been forced to jump through legal hoops just to get the care they deserve. This is landmark legislation that cuts through red tape so our vets don’t have to fight the VA while also battling the effects of toxic exposure.
RepSlotkin,"Some HUGE news for our veterans — my Veterans Burn Pits Exposure Recognition Act was included when this bill passed the House earlier this year, and I’ll be working to ensure it makes its way into the final product.

RepSlotkin,For years we looked the other way on Russian aggression in the hopes that it would go away. We can’t make the same mistake in another important part of Europe. 4/4
RepSlotkin,"Case in point is the Balkans: Given the painful history, we must be clear in our response to actions that threaten peace or contribute to the tensions between Kosovars and Serbs. 3/4"
RepSlotkin,"The U.S. &amp; Kosovo have a special relationship, born from shared history &amp; close cooperation. Today, we built on that with discussions on energy, economic cooperation &amp; the different way we need to look at security in Europe now that Russia has so egregiously invaded Ukraine. 2/4"
RepSlotkin,"This afternoon, I had the pleasure of sitting down with Prime Minister of the Republic of Kosovo @albinkurti. He came by way of Michigan, where he spent time with members of our state’s thriving diaspora. 1/4 https://t.co/dSsstDgtlw"
RepSlotkin,"When it comes to microchips, I can promise you that China isn’t dragging their feet. We need your push to have any chance of getting this done by August 1."
RepSlotkin,"To House &amp; Senate leadership: I haven’t forgotten about the Bipartisan Innovation Act &amp; neither have the auto workers in my district. Over three months since it passed the House, nearly a YEAR since it passed the Senate.

RepSlotkin,"The process for creating the federal budget is a long &amp; winding road, and there are no guarantees, but you better believe I‘ll be fighting for these projects every step of the way. For more information &amp; details, be sure to check out the link below. 4/4 https://t.co/xEAlyJx8Gi"
RepSlotkin,"When selecting these projects, I looked for ones that would bring real solutions to our district – providing resources for our first responders, keeping our kids safe at school, and cleaning up our water supply – and have clear and broad community support. 3/4"
RepSlotkin,Today we’re announcing the 15 projects that I will be advocating for to receive federal funding for next year. 2/4 https://t.co/4I0zpZcIo9
RepSlotkin,"Last year, my team &amp; I worked with local leaders for months to bring over $16 million home to Michigan’s 8th District to support a host of causes including law enforcement, public safety &amp; critical infrastructure. Now, we’re gearing up to do it again. 1/4 https://t.co/u0Cii5cTWE"
RepSlotkin,The desperation of parents looking for formula is heart-wrenching. My team is in touch with the White House to confirm this is true.  Websites and links aren’t enough if we don’t increase supply. https://t.co/tsRxoQpd56
RepSlotkin,"We can spread the word about reporting incidents of hate against any racial, religious or ethnic group, and help stop the climb up the ladder of escalation for the next tragedy. Here’s how you do it: https://t.co/NWOzBnftZV 9/9"
RepSlotkin,"The people of Buffalo have a long road of healing ahead, and I wish them strength and resolve as they grapple with this devastating loss. But for the rest of us, there is something we can do to help stop these tragedies in the future. 8/9"
RepSlotkin,"A year ago we passed the NO HATE law, which puts more money into collecting data on these incidents and crimes. But it’s not going to be as effective as possible unless people actually report. 7/9"
RepSlotkin,"As we’re already learning, the shooter in Buffalo had a record of making troubling statements. There were warning signs that were missed, including activity online that should have raised alarm bells, and that’s why it’s so important to alert law enforcement. 6/9"
RepSlotkin,"We have a significant problem with under-reporting of hate crimes against all kinds of groups. People either don’t think it’s a big enough deal and don’t want to bother anyone, or they don’t know that there’s a specific way to report incidents of hate. 5/9"
RepSlotkin,"People climb higher and, in rare but horrible circumstances like the Tree of Life or in Buffalo, it results in an act of domestic terrorism. But here’s the issue: if the earlier, more minor incidents aren’t reported, it's very hard to stop the climb up the ladder. 4/9"
RepSlotkin,That ladder often starts relatively small — looking online at hate and making hateful comments against others. Then it escalates to something like graffiti or hateful comments to co-workers or classmates. 3/9
RepSlotkin,"Most violent attackers don’t start with the act of violence. They climb what’s called a ‘ladder of escalation,’ often for some time, the top of which is an extremist attack like what has happened in Buffalo. 2/9"
RepSlotkin,"As we learn more about the white supremacy and hate behind the attack in Buffalo, it’s important to understand what more we can do to stop future attacks like this. 1/9"
RepSlotkin,"My team, along with towns like Oxford, are here to help just as so many communities nationwide were a help to us at that painful time."
RepSlotkin,"The racial motivations behind the violence in Buffalo is particularly terrible, and seems to demonstrate how the deep divisions in our country can take a violent turn. I wish both these communities the strength to get through these terrible next few weeks."
RepSlotkin,"Just as @RepJoeNeguse &amp; @RepTedDeutch reached out to me to offer support &amp; advice in the hours, days &amp; weeks when our children were killed, now I find myself offering the same to a new pair of members."
RepSlotkin,"In the last few hours I’ve reached reached out to Reps. Higgins &amp; Moore after the terrible shootings in Buffalo &amp; Milwaukee. As I learned when my own district had a shooting in Oxford last fall, there is a tragic fraternity of members who have had shootings in their districts."
RepSlotkin,"Sasha’s love for her country is infectious, and her tireless work on behalf of the Ukrainian people has been nothing short of inspirational."
RepSlotkin,"I’ve stayed in touch with @SashaUstinovaUA since our first meeting just a week after Russia launched its invasion, when she came to Congress at 9 months pregnant. We sat down again today with @ANTAC_ua’s @dkaleniuk &amp; others to discuss military &amp; humanitarian support for Ukraine. https://t.co/Qcc60zZ8n2"
RepSlotkin,Journalism is not a crime &amp; neither is attending a funeral. Shireen Abu Akleh was an American citizen performing important work of transparency in a conflict. The Israeli government is responsible for ensuring there is real accountability for her death. https://t.co/e99OZAjASz
RepSlotkin,"Long term, we need to focus on making our supply chains more resilient. As long as a single point of failure can threaten Americans' health — especially American babies — we've got a lot of work to do."
RepSlotkin,"This is a matter of urgency: the FDA needs to be prioritizing getting Michigan’s Abbott plant back online, and the administration needs to look at options for easing restrictions on imported formula from places like Canada until this emergency is resolved."
RepSlotkin,"At an event with local nurses last week, a nurse pulled me aside, desperately worried about the formula shortage — especially formula for babies with sensitive conditions. Right now, moms are bartering on Facebook &amp; driving around from store to store trying to find what they can."
RepSlotkin,"As much as I love to hear that Russia’s military has been forced to use chips from dishwashers, the global shortage is a huge threat to our own national AND economic security. Shame on Congress for dragging our feet on the Bipartisan Innovation Act — we need to pass it now. https://t.co/8gzAIlnESL"
