JimInhofe,"This week, during National Public Works Week, we celebrate our past accomplishments in public works and look to the future. A future where we prioritize responsible, bipartisan investment in real infrastructure and the men and women who work to sustain it every day. https://t.co/iXL0r8UxyO"
JimInhofe,"Promising results from Air Force’s recent hypersonic missile test. However, until we consistently provide @DeptofDefense with the real budget growth it needs, China’s and Russia’s lead in hypersonic strike capabilities will only grow larger. #FY23NDAA

JimInhofe,The @DeptofDefense Inspector General just confirmed what our military commanders have said all along: “Logistical challenges” &amp; “limited intelligence” have prevented the military from conducting any over-the-horizon counterterrorism operations since we left Afghanistan. https://t.co/NIiNhGxFJU
JimInhofe,"Biden conceded to terrorists by removing al-Gamaa al-Islamiya from the terrorism list. Al-Gamaa's leader, 'The Blind Sheikh,' plotted to attack tunnels &amp; bridges in NYC. Al-Gamaa sent jihadis to Syria.
 
If @POTUS gets away w/ lifting this designation, he will lift the IRGC's. https://t.co/k30hWPE0gO"
JimInhofe,"Under no circumstance should @POTUS end Title 42 w/o sufficient resources to secure our border. If the administration gets its way, as many as 1 million migrants could try to cross the border in the following 6 weeks — making an already historic crisis worse. https://t.co/ltEmqiyfQM"
JimInhofe,"I welcome the news that Sweden will apply to join @NATO — a country already contributing to burden-sharing in Europe, deterring Russia &amp; delivering aid like anti-tank weapons to Ukraine. I support strengthening these ties further - it benefits both U.S. and European security."
JimInhofe,"Not only did @potus leave 1000s of Americans behind in his hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan, but he also left behind 1000s of Afghans who helped U.S. service members. Reading Hamdullah’s story is a heart-breaking reminder of how this admin has turned its back on our friends. https://t.co/5rhqjSQLSn"
JimInhofe,"Two years ago today, Pres. Trump announced Operation Warp Speed, aiming to deliver a safe &amp; effective COVID vaccine by Dec 2020.

Led by Gen. Perna, OWS accomplished its mission &amp; saved millions of American lives.

I urge @POTUS to honor the heroes of OWS. https://t.co/mfuFrueWMS"
JimInhofe,"I want to congratulate my friend H.H. Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed on his election as UAE President. He is a brave leader and vital U.S. partner, who shares our interest in a peaceful Middle East free of extremists. I wish him all the best. https://t.co/iKjUx81hnP"
JimInhofe,"The @WhiteHouse may have to ration vaccines – after they gutted the program started by President Trump that led the effective distribution of vaccines last spring.
 
Under Trump, we got 3 vaccines w/ $18B.
Under Biden, 0 vaccines w/ $1.9T.

JimInhofe,"I send my condolences to my friends in the UAE on the passing of their President H.H. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan. He was an important friend to the U.S., always committed to working together to strengthen security. I know our partnership will remain strong in the future."
JimInhofe,"Met w @FINambUS yesterday to discuss Russia threats, support to Ukraine, &amp; Finland seeking NATO membership. Finland already significantly contributes to NATO &amp; U.S. security, especially in the Baltic &amp; Arctic regions. I support their path to strengthening those ties even further! https://t.co/eMAKaf34co"
