SenatorRomney,"Cancelling nearly $2 trillion in student loan debt would be wildly inflationary at a time of already historic inflation. It makes no sense at all! While the President’s legal authority here is dubious at best, our bill would prevent him from taking action. https://t.co/wPvrDkCamh"
SenatorRomney,"It is in the best interest of America to see Ukraine succeed and Russia fail. If Russia wins, this won't be the last time it invades a neighbor. Stronger nuclear nations will be emboldened to invade and oppress other sovereign nations. Russia winning is a win for authoritarians. https://t.co/9v9qieOBwW"
SenatorRomney,Finland is a steadfast security partner to NATO—and a vital friend as free nations come together to bolster the Ukrainians in their fight against Putin’s illegal war. Met with @FINambUS to discuss their decision to seek NATO membership and the ongoing situation in Ukraine. https://t.co/U1s7Q0fgPo
SenatorRomney,"As wildfires become more widespread &amp; destructive, our fire policies are in need of an update. Our wildfire commission, signed into law in the bipartisan infrastructure bill, will bring together experts &amp; stakeholders to modernize our wildfire mitigation &amp; prevention strategies. https://t.co/rGTPGJiXxp"
SenatorRomney,"In addition to continuing to investigate the two tragic infant deaths, @US_FDA must also examine its own actions and apply lessons learned to both prevent future shortages and ensure the highest safety and quality standards."
SenatorRomney,"I’m encouraged by reports that @US_FDA is working with the manufacturer to reopen our country’s largest domestic baby formula plant, and easing import rules to allow critical supplies to be sent in from overseas. However, the action must not stop there. https://t.co/yobLFvP3Tn"
SenatorRomney,"During National Police Week, we recognize the service and sacrifice of the men and women who serve in law enforcement—a job which can often take a heavy personal toll. Thank you for all that you do to protect our communities and we pray for your continued safety. https://t.co/M6XKvGa3nE"
SenatorRomney,Ann and I wish @GovCox a speedy recovery! https://t.co/hvOuJkPoCI
SenatorRomney,"Each day, the men and women in law enforcement put their lives on the line to protect our communities. During National Police Week, I especially want to thank all of our officers in Utah, as well as those who serve in our U.S. @CapitolPolice force. Thank you for all that you do! https://t.co/jpKqPsFyLX"
