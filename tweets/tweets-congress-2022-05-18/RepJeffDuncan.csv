RepJeffDuncan,"Does Biden want higher gas prices? It seems so, given his war on American energy and refusal to change course. Check out this @WSJ perspective on the president's self-sabotaging approach to American energy.

RepJeffDuncan,Gas prices are at a new record-high nationwide (AAA) and continue to climb due to Joe Biden's war on American energy. The #BidenPriceHike could be reversed by unleashing domestic energy production. It's time to #FliptheSwitch on American energy to solve the energy crisis. https://t.co/xl9X20qLMe
RepJeffDuncan,"BREAKING: The Biden Administration has reportedly paused its Orwellian ""Disinformation Governance Board"" after facing heavy backlash. We are fighting back and winning!"
RepJeffDuncan,"The Biden Admin. is taking a “whole of government approach” to regulate the oil and gas industry out of existence, making it nearly impossible to build and permit natural gas pipelines and critical energy infrastructure, which fuels our energy crisis.

RepJeffDuncan,Joe Biden has been in office for almost 50 years and has never run a business or done anything outside of elected office. No wonder he can’t figure out supply chain issues or even how to increase the production/supply of baby formula for American moms.

RepJeffDuncan,"Proud to join all SC Republicans &amp; 100+ Members in calling on SCOTUS to take up a case to delist Planned Parenthood as an SC Medicaid provider. @PPFA is a pro-abortion activist group that profits off of the killing of unborn babies, masquerading its services as “health care."""
RepJeffDuncan,"Congress must ensure the Biden Admin. is not able to erode American sovereignty – whether at WHO, the UN, or any other international body. This is something I'm paying close attention to &amp; will continue fighting to make sure American sovereignty is protected and not undermined."
RepJeffDuncan,"I have heard from many of you regarding the Biden Administration’s proposed amendments to the World Health Organization’s International Health Regulations (IHR). I share your concerns about WHO, especially with how it botched the response to COVID-19 and buddied up with China."
RepJeffDuncan,"We've been fighting China for years under President Trump while Hunter Biden was cutting deals with the CCP. As it now stands, this China legislation falls far short. I am proud to be a conferee to fight for America-first policies &amp; energy dominance.

RepJeffDuncan,"The Biden Administration’s safe smoking kits do, in fact, include free CRACK PIPES, using your taxpayer dollars for drug paraphernalia. Biden's America = no baby formula, free crack pipes. 
https://t.co/3HVmDPXI4y"
RepJeffDuncan,"Yet another America-last energy policy from Joe Biden to further his war on American energy as he panders to the radical Left. Canceling oil and gas lease sales sets us back and makes us more energy-dependent while increasing pain at the gas pump.

RepJeffDuncan,This week is #NationalPoliceWeek. I am thankful for and inspired by these brave heroes who run into harm's way each day to keep our communities safe. We stand with law enforcement and remain committed to supporting their work. https://t.co/EPYmEwPtKv
