RodneyDavis,"Iâ€™m honored to be recognized by the @floodcoalition. I represent many river communities who face flood risk, and Iâ€™m working in Congress to make sure they have tools and resources to protect their infrastructure, property, and lives from natural disasters. https://t.co/SOcmQ5DdyZ"
RodneyDavis,Iâ€™m here to serve you. This #ConstituentServiceSpotlight is another example of how my office and I can help. Reach out if we can ever be of assistance: https://t.co/UwfjLHml8t https://t.co/IgZskQ3yVe
RodneyDavis,"Earlier today,Â @RepSamGraves,Â @RepBost, and I met with @IRTBA members to talk about issues facing theÂ transportationÂ industry.

RodneyDavis,"This is the #BidenBorderCrisis, caused by the President's open borders policies and rhetoric, and it's jeopardizing public safety across our country.

Law enforcement at the border must get every legal tool and resource they need to fight this crisis, including Title 42. https://t.co/70U56rOwyx"
RodneyDavis,"Our bill would protect and promote respect for first responders by sending a strong message to criminals out there â€“ if you target, harm, or kill a police officer or first responder, be prepared to face the federal death penalty, regardless of what your state laws are."
RodneyDavis,"My GOP colleagues and I are urging Speaker Pelosi to bring the Thin Blue Line Act to the floor for a vote. Our police and first responders deserve to have the full force of the law protecting their professions.

RodneyDavis,"In the long term, we need to do more to bolster our domestic supply chains so we can avoid major supply disruptions like the closure of one mfg. facility. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve introduced the Rural Investment in America Act, to make more things, including food products, in America."
RodneyDavis,"In the near term, the Biden Administration needs to do more to get formula manufacturing capacity back online and should also consider allowing the importation of formula from the United Kingdom and/or the European Union, like the FDA allowed for PPE during the pandemic."
RodneyDavis,"The baby formula shortage weâ€™re seeing right now is unacceptable, and itâ€™s the fault of the Biden Administration who has failed to address supply chain shortages and forced producers to shutter production plants."

RodneyDavis,"Inflation is a tax on every single American, and it's been caused in part by the out-of-control govt. spending pushed by Joe Biden and Dems in DC.

Even with historic inflation, Dems are doubling down on the same policy agenda that contributed to the problem in the first place. https://t.co/srxhWgSuHF"
RodneyDavis,"On this Peace Officers Memorial Day, we honor and remember the members of the law enforcement community who gave their last full measure of devotion in service to our communities. May God bless our police and their families. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ https://t.co/HcZmjzTUD4"

RodneyDavis,"Democrats in Washington are discouraging investment in American energy sources with their so-called ""Green New Deal"" agenda, costing families more $.

Biden's gimmicks aren't providing relief from high energy costs. We need to completely unleash the American energy sector. https://t.co/5vOHKLX7am"
