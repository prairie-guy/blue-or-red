RosaDeLauro,"Thank you, @POTUS.
 
I have called for the swift importation of safe infant formula from FDA-approved facilities overseas since the start of the crisis and the need to invoke the Defense Production Act. 

With Operation Fly Formula &amp; DPA, we are answering the call to families. https://t.co/873cqbdj9Q"
RosaDeLauro,"Today, we’ll move legislation that immediately addresses this shortage by getting product back on shelves and in the coming weeks, I will prepare legislation that betters food safety and helps prevent this crisis from happening again."
RosaDeLauro,"This shortage, caused in large part by corporate greed, consolidation, and disgraceful lack of oversight, is now causing parents to struggle to feed their babies. https://t.co/XYkNtqlpea"
RosaDeLauro,".@DataProgress reports that 61% of voters support me and @SenWarren's Schedules That Work Act.
 
Workers and their families deserve stability and security, not schedules left to the whims of their employer.
 
This is what workers want. We have to listen.
https://t.co/ckTkZAX8FY"
RosaDeLauro,"I agree, @SecretaryPete. https://t.co/O1po2l2fTZ"
RosaDeLauro,"The infant formula shortage currently facing our country is unacceptable. No parent should ever have to wonder how they will feed their child.
 
@HouseDemocrats &amp; @AppropsDems will lead the way to secure emergency funding that will help fix this shortage &amp; #FeedOurInfants. https://t.co/L6WNMt6Bnu"
RosaDeLauro,It was an honor to have Greek Prime Minister @kmitsotakis address a Joint Session of Congress this morning to mark the Greek bicentennial. I look forward to our continued partnership with Greece. https://t.co/sgRrtDE6ue
RosaDeLauro,"It’s not too late to get vaccinated and boosted! 

Find a vaccine site near you at https://t.co/seoZCIpd09."
RosaDeLauro,"America marks a grave milestone with 1 million lives lost to COVID-19. 

We cannot lose sight of defeating this pandemic. 

We must ignite our efforts to provide sufficient supply of vaccines, diagnostics, and treatment to effectively fight this virus. 
https://t.co/rjxSzNjxa1"
RosaDeLauro,"WATCH LIVE:

I'm joining @SpeakerPelosi and @HouseDemocrats to announce legislation that will help parents find safe, affordable formula and ensure our babies get the nutrition they need. https://t.co/kiXIIWEZQN"
RosaDeLauro,"Looking to claim your Child Tax Credit? 

It’s not too late — you can still file your tax return to get the Child Tax Credit and additional tax benefits on https://t.co/hxbMQocIME.

The simplified filing tool makes it easier for families to claim their benefit, don’t wait!"
RosaDeLauro,"Let's not forget — the monthly #ChildTaxCredit was a lifeline to the middle class and lifted half of our nation’s children out of poverty. 
 
Everyday I'm fighting to make the monthly expanded Child Tax Credit permanent. Our families deserve and need it. https://t.co/376ird5WpP"
RosaDeLauro,"This bill is the first step to help restock shelves and end this shortage. 

However, the work is not done. We must investigate serious safety concerns at the Abbott facility in Sturgis, MI and the FDA’s failure to swiftly address this issue. https://t.co/nPZd8B6CZA"
RosaDeLauro,"I will review the details of this document. Abbott Nutrition knowingly sold a product that killed at least two infants and hospitalized several more. They must be held accountable.  

As I’ve said before, boosting supply cannot come at the cost of safety.
https://t.co/lZRw39zoBO"
RosaDeLauro,"Today, 43% of infant formula is out of stock nationwide. 

Parents shouldn't have to choose between infant formula supply and food safety. 

I will move quickly to introduce legislation that will address funding and safety needs. We will get to the bottom of this crisis. https://t.co/U0q3Ovb3t1"
RosaDeLauro,"The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes a $65 billion investment to ensure all Americans can access affordable, reliable, and high-speed internet.
 
@POTUS and @SecRaimondo's #InternetForAll Initiative is a big deal!
 
Access to internet isn't a luxury—it's a necessity."
RosaDeLauro,"America runs on high-speed internet.
 
I've listened to students &amp; teachers in CT who have shared how the obstacles to remote learning are compounded by limited access to internet. 

Far too many families don't have internet access at the speed &amp; cost they need. https://t.co/CuoX0owmuz"
RosaDeLauro,"Assault weapons have no place on our streets or in our homes. Racism has no place in our nation.  

My heart breaks for Buffalo &amp; the families grieving lost loved ones.

The nation is kept hostage by a murderous &amp; racist faction who use the constitution for lawless ends."
RosaDeLauro,"@symonemsnbc As Chair of @AppropsDems, I will bring to the House floor an emergency supplemental appropriation to get infant formula back on shelves. 

Beyond that, I will hold hearings and act on legislation to examine what went wrong and how we prevent this in the future."
RosaDeLauro,"On @symonemsnbc, I shared how Abbott Nutrition, the nation’s largest infant formula manufacturer, has cornered the market. Their contaminated product has been recalled from stores and families are scrambling to feed their babies. 

We need to urgently address supply and safety. https://t.co/cAEkizxizC"
RosaDeLauro,Tune in now⤵️ https://t.co/MuNIl6uoHe
RosaDeLauro,"As Chair of @AppropsDems, I will introduce an emergency supplemental appropriation to boost domestic supply of infant formula.

But we cannot just boost supply. We need to ensure that formula sold to families is reliable and safe – period. https://t.co/7k4kZyYR1t"
RosaDeLauro,"On @TheBeatWithAri, I talked about the infant formula shortage.

The contaminated infant formula found at Abbott Laboratories is a colossal failure. We must work to increase supply and keep our children fed, but it cannot be at the cost of food safety. https://t.co/h9j3TBx9ZN"
RosaDeLauro,"I’ll be on @thebeatwithari with @aliciamenendez to discuss the infant formula shortage and keeping food safe.

Tune in at 6:20 PM ⬇️ https://t.co/htr6Piv3v8"
RosaDeLauro,"The report released by @COVIDOversight is damning.

At least 284 workers died in the meatpacking industry between 2020 &amp; 2021. Meatpackers need to answer for this deception, be held accountable for endangering workers, &amp; must immediately lower food costs.
https://t.co/mWcaajva37"
RosaDeLauro,"While I agree with @SecRaimondo on outbound investment screening, one thing is for sure—Connecticut is home to the best Italian food in the U.S. https://t.co/n72foCfhZH"
RosaDeLauro,"Right now, my legislation is before the COMPETES/USICA Conference Committee.
 
@SecRaimondo agrees—outbound investment screening protections must be included in the final package. We will protect manufacturing at home &amp; safeguard American workers through the NCCDA."
RosaDeLauro,"Today, I asked @SecRaimondo about my bipartisan legislation, the National Critical Capabilities Defense Act (NCCDA), which provides for an outbound investment screening mechanism that would protect the U.S. supply chain from foreign adversaries like China &amp; Russia. https://t.co/bA5YBKSa8y"
RosaDeLauro,"The CT-03 Congressional Arts Competition is an event I look forward to every year.
 
To all the young artists who participated – thank you for making these beautiful pieces, enriching our lives, and allowing us to appreciate your gifts.
 
Congratulations! https://t.co/q9TX1iIuQj"
RosaDeLauro,"@Charles__IT My American Apprenticeship Act allows businesses to create a pipeline of skilled workers—it gives states funding for the creation or expansion of tuition assistance for registered apprenticeship programs. 

Workers win. Businesses win. Our economy grows."
RosaDeLauro,"At @Charles__IT, I was proud to announce investments in small businesses that create &amp; sustain good paying jobs through federal apprenticeship &amp; technical training programs.

We have to meet local labor market demands by building up a skilled workforce.
