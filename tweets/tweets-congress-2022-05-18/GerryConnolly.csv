GerryConnolly,"Leadership.

This, paired with the legislation @HouseDemocrats will pass tonight, will be a huge relief for families across the country.

Thank you, @POTUS. https://t.co/BnZsuhU59R"
GerryConnolly,"Col. Yevgeny Vindman is a true public servant. He has more patriotism in his pinky finger than Donald Trump will ever have. 

As the Pentagon IG has now confirmed, he deserved none of the retaliatory vitriol thrown at him by the former president and his team. https://t.co/K5ffLOHn1f"
GerryConnolly,"Republicans want to force our daughters to live with fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers had.

It's reprehensible and un-American, and we will not stand for it.

GerryConnolly,"Amidst infant formula shortages across the country, families are going to bed wondering how they will get their babies the food they need.

Today, @HouseDemocrats will pass a bill to help #FeedOurInfants by providing the FDA with the resources it needs to address this shortage. https://t.co/2vauq3bpQE"
GerryConnolly,#HeadStart has provided critical support to families and children across the nation. Thank you for going the extra mile to continue our mission of preparing America‚Äôs young children to succeed in school and in life. #HappyBdayHeadStart https://t.co/QxmGoiv3RP
GerryConnolly,"Today, on International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, we recommit ourselves to supporting the LGBTQ+ community and to rooting out bigotry and hatred wherever they appear. #IDAHOBIT"
GerryConnolly,"This week, @HouseDemocrats will take action on legislation to prevent domestic terrorism, crack down on price gouging at the pump, and address baby formula shortages.

House Republicans will spend the week defending their hateful ideology and doubling down on white nationalism."
GerryConnolly,"Training lapses are deadly serious. This is yet another preventable service and safety setback for Metro, caused by letting a safety issue languish. The Safety Commission is again demonstrating why Congress helped establish this critical oversight body.

GerryConnolly,"Congratulations to all of the awardees at this year‚Äôs Northern Virginia District PTA ceremony. The dedicated work you all do is why our schools are so strong, keep up the great work! https://t.co/LvPre7puQU"
GerryConnolly,"Heartbroken and horrified by yesterday‚Äôs shooting in Buffalo. This hate crime must be called out and these weapons have no place in our communities. Too often this pain is unleashed, this time at a grocery store. Enough. The Senate must act."
GerryConnolly,"I am deeply saddened by the tragic killing of American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Accountability for those responsible must be immediate, impartial, and transparent. I stand with my colleagues in Congress in defense of press freedom and the protection of journalists worldwide."
GerryConnolly,"I‚Äôm seeing lots of talk about how unprecedented it is to subpoena GOP congressmen for their role in Jan 6.

I can tell you what‚Äôs more unprecedented: taking away a right from the American people for the first time in our history, as the GOP-appointed Supreme Court is about to do."
GerryConnolly,"Missing a putt to the left is a ‚Äúmistake we can learn from.‚Äù Murdering and dismembering a respected journalist, my constituent, is a deliberate, heinous crime.

It should be met with consequences, not an invite to play 18.
