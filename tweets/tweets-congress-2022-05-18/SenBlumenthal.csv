SenBlumenthal,President Biden is right to utilize the Defense Protection Act—as I’ve urged—to help ease the infant formula shortage. Parents need solutions. We must work urgently to provide vital nutrition to babies. More imports too. https://t.co/56MKVHObg3
SenBlumenthal,The facts are simple—domestic violence is 5x more deadly when there is a gun in the house. Today we are hearing from witnesses about the need to protect survivors &amp; close loopholes to keep firearms out of the hands of abusers. https://t.co/CwDtJBP6J1
SenBlumenthal,"With President Biden’s signature, the Safe Sleep for Babies Act will prevent more needless tragedies &amp; save new parents from unknowingly purchasing perilous padding for their children’s cribs. I’m proud to have joined my colleagues in this bipartisan effort. https://t.co/YcSvXQAHi1"
SenBlumenthal,"Wonderful to meet with Finland’s Ambassador Hautala yesterday, as their parliament approves joining NATO. Putin’s barbaric, brutal invasion is bolstering NATO &amp; bringing together nations that prize freedom &amp; democracy, now under assault. https://t.co/nJuplvQKzp"
SenBlumenthal,"I was proud to meet with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis &amp; congratulate him on his powerful &amp; eloquent words to the American people, reminding us of our common commitment to democracy &amp; the rule of law, &amp; the need for courage to fight for these values."
SenBlumenthal,Stirring call to action by Greek Prime Minister @kmitsotakis to defend democracy &amp; freedom—an unshakable bond between our countries—in his speech to Congress that I attended today. Greek gifts to our nation of both values &amp; people in the Greek American community are priceless. https://t.co/dMw8VO0ryb
SenBlumenthal,"The Abbott agreement is a start, but families need more action &amp; quickly. FDA must enable expanded imports, expedite production, &amp; engage other manufacturers right away. Longer term, more competition is vital to lowering prices &amp; increasing supply. https://t.co/0FFvEwuTAL"
SenBlumenthal,"Parents need concrete solutions &amp; answers from the FDA &amp; FTC. We must address the issues that led to this infant formula failure &amp; just as critically, focus on getting safe, affordable baby formula to the families that need it now. https://t.co/Z13BIyPAZy"
SenBlumenthal,"Congrats to John Colandro, Michael Rosero, &amp; Chad Titus on being awarded the Medal of Valor. Your heroism &amp; bravery when rescuing men trapped in a truck in the frigid waters of the Stamford Harbor is unparalleled. @SFDPIO thank you for your unwavering service to the community. https://t.co/NzUF3Su1qo"
SenBlumenthal,"Raising an infant is stressful enough w/o wondering whether you will be able to find—or afford—the food your child needs to grow, thrive, &amp; stay healthy. @rosadelauro &amp; I are writing to FDA &amp; FTC demanding urgent action to address these shortages &amp; scams as well as price gouging. https://t.co/D2Edeyz55l"
SenBlumenthal,"Energizing, inspiring calls to action from Voices for Choice in Wilton yesterday, with pride in CT’s recently passed safeguards, but urgent support for our federal Women’s Health Protection Act. Eloquent speakers urging that we must carry the fight forward. https://t.co/TvX9qsfQCB"
SenBlumenthal,A perfect sun-filled afternoon yesterday for University of New Haven’s commencement. President Kaplan &amp; his fabulous faculty are doing fantastic work. Congrats to every graduate &amp; your family.
SenBlumenthal,Grateful to organizers of Hartford’s rally for reproductive freedom—activists who know that critical freedoms are about to be stripped away from women by a radical right SCOTUS. Great spirit &amp; numbers today showed CT is ready for the fight ahead. https://t.co/RqrNuEl5y5
SenBlumenthal,"So inspired to join yesterday in celebrating fantastic St. Joseph’s University graduates—their exuberance raising the XL Center’s roof.  Congrats to you, your families, &amp; great educators."
SenBlumenthal,"A proud, exciting day for Post University graduates &amp; families—filling the Palace Theater in Waterbury with rollicking joy &amp; applause. We need their skills &amp; energy more than ever."
SenBlumenthal,"For the evils of Replacement Theory, there are no “good people on both sides.” This twisted hate ideology deserves to be denounced &amp; shunned clearly &amp; loudly. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting stronger hate crimes legislation."
SenBlumenthal,"Extolled by racist extremists, Replacement Theory has become the go-to hate mantra of domestic terrorists—with a gloss of legitimacy from the far right fringe ecosystem. All must condemn it. My silent colleagues are complicit."
SenBlumenthal,"Justice Thomas’ fears for the Court ring hollow given his own actions. If he is really concerned about SCOTUS’ credibility, he must look in the mirror—repeated colossal conflicts of interest staring back at him. We need a SCOTUS Code of Ethics. https://t.co/f5YPmu9xVw"
SenBlumenthal,Our courts’ authority rests in the American people’s belief in their independence &amp; integrity. Conservative judicial activism seeking to overturn 50 yrs of precedent—that justices themselves described as settled in sworn testimony—staggeringly undermines the Court’s credibility.
SenBlumenthal,"Worse than the leak (unethical) is the opinion (unconscionable), stripping away women’s rights. SCOTUS stands ready to revoke abortion access, reproductive justice, &amp; the right for every person to make their own decisions about their bodies &amp; their health care."
SenBlumenthal,"Congress’ recent hate crimes bill must be bolstered, but common sense also compels gun violence prevention steps that can stop this relentless carnage. We cannot look the other away."
SenBlumenthal,More lives will be lost &amp; futures shattered if our nation &amp; Congress does not confront the hatred we allow to fester &amp; the gun violence scourge that goes unchecked. Enough must be enough.
SenBlumenthal,"My heart breaks for the Buffalo &amp; East Side community. Even as our thoughts go out to the victims &amp; families, we must honor them with action. Dark, ugly, &amp; hate-filled as this time seems, we cannot back down or give up. https://t.co/2aGqqTXKHG"
SenBlumenthal,"Truly inspiring &amp; exciting to visit Nuovo Pasta yesterday in Stratford—a fabulous American success story of hard work, great taste, &amp; caring for consumers &amp; staff. Watching the factory in action was wonderful—but tasting was the best. https://t.co/Ud5HBfvFns"
SenBlumenthal,Click Bond creates innovative products that have been utilized in the space program &amp; numerous defense projects. Wonderful to visit their Watertown facility yesterday &amp; speak with their amazing managers &amp; workers. https://t.co/X3Jbr4fTQH
SenBlumenthal,A huge congratulations to the two CT students—Maya &amp; Aditya—named 2022 Presidential Scholars. We are all so proud of your accomplishments &amp; excited for your bright futures ahead. https://t.co/Mi04BrKLXE
SenBlumenthal,Proud to stand with @SEIU to call for a living wage &amp; fair benefits for our frontline airport workers. We must support these hardworking people who are the backbone of our transportation network. https://t.co/Lpphrys1wO
SenBlumenthal,"Deeply alarming reports of shortages, scams, &amp; price gouging. We must quickly work to ensure all infants have access to the nutrition they need. I'll be demanding answers from the FTC &amp; FDA about what more can be done to fix this scarcity &amp; prevent scammers from taking advantage. https://t.co/LTWfAgFQkW"
