SenFeinstein,May is Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month! I’m celebrating the AAPI community this month and its countless contributions to California and our nation as a whole. #AAPIHeritageMonth
SenFeinstein,"For 57 years, the Head Start program has helped low-income families ensure their children receive quality, early-childhood education and support. Investing in early-childhood education is the smartest choice we can make to help children reach their full potential. https://t.co/j6UO1EsL8d"
SenFeinstein,"We need an ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to meet this challenge, including increasing our water supply, incentivizing projects that provide environmental benefits and drinking water for disadvantaged communities, and investing in environmental restoration efforts."
SenFeinstein,"As the past two years have painfully demonstrated, severe and prolonged drought exacerbated by climate change is the stark reality for the West. If we don’t take action now to improve our drought resilience, it’s only going to get worse.

SenFeinstein,"I’ve been a champion, along with @PattyMurray and others, for nearly a decade in this fight for equal rights. I’m proud the United States is the first country to ensure the men’s and women’s soccer teams are paid fairly, and I hope other nations will follow our lead."
SenFeinstein,I’m so pleased the women’s national soccer team has reached a labor agreement that will compensate them fairly for their successes on and off the field. The team has won four World Cups and four Olympic gold medals and they routinely outperform the men’s team in ticket sales. https://t.co/Avh0pdCI1D
SenFeinstein,Judges Thompson and Sykes are extremely well-qualified and I’m proud to support both of them. The president is nominating and the Senate is confirming consistently well-qualified judges to the California bench to fill vacancies and address a judicial emergency. https://t.co/VCqW98jR03
SenFeinstein,Please join me in congratulating all the Merchant Mariners of World War II receiving Congressional Gold Medals today! This recognition is long overdue and very well deserved. https://t.co/Uu3LejupS0
SenFeinstein,"Safety regulations for products like cosmetics and deodorant haven’t been updated in more than 80 years. I’m delighted that provisions from our bill to bring these regulations into the 21st century are in the HELP Committee’s draft FDA reform legislation.

SenFeinstein,"On this International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, I’m proud to stand with the LGBT community in California and across the country. Everyone deserves the freedom to love who they want and live free from hatred and discrimination."
SenFeinstein,I’m proud to support Finland and Sweden as they seek to join NATO. I enjoyed discussing this with Finland’s Ambassador Mikko Hautala in my office yesterday. https://t.co/SHlaiTzPFo
SenFeinstein,"Parents of infants can find help locating formula on this new website from @HHSgov. Information on manufacturers, health care providers, food banks and more are available here:

SenFeinstein,Wishing Senator Van Hollen all the best. I look forward to his speedy recovery and return to the Senate soon.
SenFeinstein,"Americans are paying record-high gas prices while gas companies are raking in record-high profits. It’s time for this to stop. We introduced legislation to bring greater transparency in the oil and gas markets to prevent price gouging.

SenFeinstein,Sad and so angry to hear of another mass shooting this afternoon in Orange County. These tragic events have become far too commonplace in our country. We must take action.
SenFeinstein,I’m heartbroken by the horrific shooting in Buffalo. The racism apparently at the root of this tragedy is truly sickening. We must do more to address domestic terrorism and we must make guns harder to get for dangerous individuals. My thoughts with all affected by this horror.
SenFeinstein,"The American people need faith that federal judges are deciding cases based on the law and not their own personal interests or political bias. Our bill would strengthen recusal and financial disclosure requirements to provide greater transparency.

SenFeinstein,"Formula is a critical source of nutrition for babies and the current shortage is unacceptable. Following the FDA recall of several formula products and ongoing supply chain issues, we’re calling on top formula manufacturers to maximize production to help remedy this situation. https://t.co/upg7nMdPtT"
SenFeinstein,"Congratulations to Admiral Linda Fagan on her confirmation as commandant of the Coast Guard, the first woman to lead any branch of the military! Your service and dedication to our country set a wonderful example for girls and young women everywhere.

SenFeinstein,"More Americans died from drug overdoses last year than ever before. It’s clear we’re in the midst of an overdose epidemic. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution, but addiction treatment and stopping drug trafficking will be key to addressing this heart-breaking issue. https://t.co/9k7U0UWfCV"
