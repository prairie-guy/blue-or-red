RepCarlos,"Under Biden’s failed leadership, America is looking more and more like Cuba and Venezuela. Inflation, broken supply chains, threats of Ministry of Truths, unsecured borders, incompetent leadership."
RepCarlos,"Never listen to what the Biden administration says, only what they do. This is Biden’s America: https://t.co/lSfmKNlIin"
RepCarlos,"Well, looks like it took Biden and Mayorkas 3 whole weeks to realize the American people weren't going to stand for a Ministry of Truth governing and monitoring our speech.

Fidel Castro's tactics won't work here in America. Never have, never will.

RepCarlos,"Last month was the highest number of apprehensions in the history of the entire Department of Homeland Security.

Ending Title 42 will only exacerbate Biden's border crisis. It's a ridiculous decision. https://t.co/5tEbMUjO2Q"
RepCarlos,"Lourdes and I are deeply saddened by the loss of our good friend Gus Machado. Gus was a Cuban patriot and strong advocate for freedom. He made a huge impact in the South Florida community and will be missed by everyone who knew him. We are praying for his wife, Lilliam, &amp; family."
RepCarlos,"Yesterday it’s #Cuba, today it’s #Venezuela. Biden is the worst thing to have ever happened to freedom and democracy in Latin America.

Ayer fue Cuba, hoy es Venezuela. Biden es lo peor que le pudo haber pasado a la libertad y democracia en América Latina.

RepCarlos,Lo he dicho antes y lo digo ahora: nunca se debe escuchar lo que dice Biden; hay que ver lo que el está haciendo. Su mensaje a la comunidad del exilio cubano es claro – a Biden no le importa y no avanzará la causa de la libertad y la democracia en #Cuba. Biden es una desgracia.
RepCarlos,"I have said it before, and I’ll say it again: don’t listen to what Biden says; look at what he does. His message to the Cuban exile community is clear — he does NOT care about you and will do NOTHING to advance the cause of freedom and democracy in #Cuba. Biden is a disgrace."
RepCarlos,No one wants to start their morning with an inflated cup of (Cuban) coffee every day. THIS is Joe Biden’s America: https://t.co/rUAm97dmpg
RepCarlos,We need to keep Title 42.
RepCarlos,"Congratulations to Gabriel Anseeuw for being named @USFleetForces Captain of the USS Florida. A Miami native, Gabriel enlisted over 30 yrs ago in Kendall, FL and is now the commanding officer for FL’s namesake submarine. 
 
South Florida is proud, and thanks you for your service!"
RepCarlos,"This #NationalPoliceWeek, I thank and honor all of our law enforcement officers around the nation for their brave commitment to keep our communities safe. #BackTheBlue https://t.co/wvU1fbteAU"
RepCarlos,The avg. gas price in South Florida is $4.52 today. Americans are hurting while the Biden admin continues to make it worse. https://t.co/VFVsTmutDn
RepCarlos,"Biden’s weak and gutless policies give Mexico a free ride by incentivizing them to pass their border security responsibilities to the U.S.

We must bring back President Trump's Remain in Mexico policy and make sure Mexico is doing its part in keeping its borders safe. https://t.co/e8iTkHloma"
RepCarlos,I will ALWAYS fight for a free and democratic Cuba. Thank you @RosaMariaPaya @CUBADECIDE for bringing together members of parliaments from all over the world to advance the conversation on the dangers and atrocities of communism. #PatriaYVida https://t.co/6j9Dqz35mx
