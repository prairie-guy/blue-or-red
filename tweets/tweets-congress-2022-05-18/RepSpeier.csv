RepSpeier,"While some of us enjoyed a weekend of barbecues and beach time, 49 people were shot and 17 people were killed in mass shootings in 8 U.S. communities. This insanity must stop. The NRA doesn’t own you and me, but it has a lock on Senate Republicans. https://t.co/dPlr6rG9UT"
RepSpeier,"Human rights attacks against LGBTQI+ people aren't just happening at home, they're global. 68+ nations criminalize same-sex relationships. 9 target trans people. On the Int'l Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia &amp; Transphobia &amp; every day, we stand against discrimination &amp; violence! https://t.co/0CLUck3f1Z"
RepSpeier,"The numbers speak for themselves! The Bay Area had the lowest Covid death rate in the US due to our 81% vaccination rate &amp; science-based guidelines. If the country had followed the same guidance, 651,000 people would still be alive. Instead, we're mourning 1 million deaths. https://t.co/djVWmE9jM8"
RepSpeier,".@RepGwenMoore is more than a miracle, she's a hard-charging champion of civil &amp; women's rights who never backs down. She, like me, is one of the 59% of mothers who have had abortions to secure a better future for our families. I applaud her bravery in sharing her abortion story! https://t.co/3P1HfVqk6b"
RepSpeier,"Since Alito is such an originalist about the Constitution, isn’t it time to define a “well regulated militia?”The NRA is not in the Constitution."
RepSpeier,"Take it from an MD: this is about more than just abortion, it’s about ALL reproductive rights. R’s are lying if they say they’ll stop at abortion. This party is only going for the extremes. IVF, contraception, safe &amp; critical reproductive medical treatments are all at risk! https://t.co/9popOZk8gi"
RepSpeier,"Brava Coast Guard Commandant Linda Fagan! As the first woman to lead a U.S. armed service and the longest serving safety officer, you've charted a new course for generations of women and girls. Thank you for your inspiring and groundbreaking service. https://t.co/ArOPQYqPr2"
RepSpeier,"Thx @RepMarieNewman for courageously sharing your abortion story. I know how scary it can be, but we know abortion is nothing to be ashamed of or a dirty word. Remember, 59% of women who have abortions are mothers. They respect life. Alito &amp; cohorts support birth, but not life. https://t.co/4B67enJilM"
