SenWarren,"I’ve been fighting to enhance transparency &amp; I’m glad more Pentagon officials understand our moral &amp; strategic imperative to prevent civilian casualties. But we must do more. It's critical that this year's annual defense bill include my bills.
https://t.co/kENzV4UduW"
SenWarren,"I'll be reviewing the Pentagon’s report carefully. Investigations must be independent and comprehensive, including interviewing witnesses on the ground. I recently reintroduced a bill to prevent future civilian harm &amp; hold leaders accountable when failing to follow laws of war."
SenWarren,"The 2019 US airstrike in Syria is among the most devastating instance of civilian harm. We need accountability &amp; transparency—and that's why I called for an investigation into this strike. We can't continue accepting civilian death &amp; harm as a cost of war.

SenWarren,"The shortage of baby formula today is due in part to a lack of competition.

While Abbott raked in massive profits in this highly consolidated industry, their execs ignored safety warnings and gave away billions to investors.

@SenBooker &amp; I want answers.

SenWarren,"Democrats need to use every tool possible to protect a woman's right to choose. With an extremist Supreme Court poised to overturn Roe, I’m calling out data brokers for their disturbing practice of selling location data of women visiting abortion clinics.

SenWarren,"The majority of student loans are held by those with no household wealth. That’s not surprising. It’s the reason why they had to borrow money in the first place to try and advance their education.
 
@POTUS should #CancelStudentDebt to help millions of hardworking Americans."
SenWarren,"Americans overwhelmingly support the right for every woman to control her own future. But Republicans want to overturn #RoeVWade and force their unpopular agenda on the rest of America. 
 
We can't go back. Never."
SenWarren,One million Americans have died from COVID-19. We must honor the family &amp; friends we've lost &amp; those who continue to be affected by this pandemic. My resolution would establish a day of remembrance for COVID-19 victims &amp; survivors—Congress should pass it. https://t.co/CT5OPBJFIs
SenWarren,".@JeffBezos is a thin-skinned billionaire lashing out as a distraction from @Amazon’s shameful treatment of workers and its massive tax avoidance. 

@POTUS’ plan will fight inflation by making giant corporations pay their fair share &amp; fund investments like affordable child care."
SenWarren,"Trader Joe's is a multi-billion dollar company, but they've been slashing workers’ pay and benefits in recent years &amp; cutting corners on worker safety during a pandemic. I stand with Trader Joe's workers in Massachusetts organizing for better pay, benefits, and work conditions. https://t.co/M6l8Tx7v7V"
SenWarren,"I stand in solidarity with @BEUBrookline fighting for better pay and working conditions that reflect the important work they do every day for our kids. They’re pushing for policies to recruit and retain educators of color, and I’m with them all the way.
https://t.co/OKD3lTtYXB"
SenWarren,"Black women shoulder a disproportionate amount of the student debt crisis, holding 47% more debt than white men and 27% more than white women.
 
.@POTUS should #CancelStudentDebt to help close the racial wealth gap among borrowers.
https://t.co/0LU4IwOV8z"
SenWarren,"Underinvestment, restrictive zoning and Wall Street exploitation have jacked up housing costs for American families. I've been calling for policies to expand housing supply and loosen big investors' hold on the market.

@POTUS’ housing plan is a strong move to lower costs. https://t.co/jNHG0OC9b6"
SenWarren,"Some Supreme Court Justices have accepted lavish trips and failed to file financial disclosures. Judges and Justices sat in cases in which they own individual stock in the parties. Our judicial ethics system is broken, but I've got a plan to help fix it.
https://t.co/PIEdObgTKp"
SenWarren,"Corporations are bragging about jacking up prices. And they get away with it because our markets lack competition. My Price Gouging Prevention Act would give the @FTC more power to go after price-gougers so we can lower costs for families.
https://t.co/b5YHNOj02I"
SenWarren,"I’m heartbroken for the Buffalo community. We must condemn racist domestic terrorist attacks. This horrific tragedy is not an isolated incident. Violent domestic extremism motivated by hate is an urgent threat, and exacerbated by weak gun laws. Congress must act."
SenWarren,"Abortion rights are under attack. Today, Americans across the country are fighting back to defend #RoeVWade and the right of every person to make their own decisions about their futures.

We can't go back — not now, not ever. I'm in this fight all the way. #BansOffOurBodies"
SenWarren,"While Americans are facing a housing affordability crisis, giant Wall Street firms are buying homes in bulk at record rates—they’re jacking housing prices even higher, and making massive profits. 

@SenJackReed and I are urging @HUDgov to stem the flow of homes to big investors."
SenWarren,"It was great visiting Holyoke, MA! Mayor Joshua Garcia, Rep. Duffy, local officials and I discussed American Rescue Plan funding that we helped secure for small businesses. We also stopped by The Plan to talk about why I'm fighting for these federal investments. https://t.co/GTnEC3GDgt"
SenWarren,The killing of Shireen Abu Akleh and the attacks on mourners by Israeli forces at her funeral are deeply disturbing. A free press is a cornerstone of democracy and journalists should not be killed for doing their jobs. We need a full independent investigation.
SenWarren,".@POTUS should #CancelStudentDebt. This will benefit our whole economy. It'll allow people to save money up to buy their own homes, start a small business, and provide them with a chance to build on their economic futures. We should make this investment in our young people today. https://t.co/SdLDZj2dI6"
SenWarren,"When @amazon's Edwardsville warehouse collapsed in Dec, killing 6 workers, @RepCori, @RepAOC &amp; I demanded answers.
 
Their response is clear: Amazon does the bare minimum to protect workers. Now it should cooperate with Congressional investigators.
https://t.co/tC0cbxCJsw"
SenWarren,"When Putin invaded Ukraine, @GoldmanSachs and @jpmorgan were lauded for leaving Russia. 

The catch? All along they were exploiting sanctions loopholes to continue profiting off of the war. 

@RepKatiePorter and I want answers.
https://t.co/8NjOCtv6x1"
SenWarren,"Working families should not bear the cost of fighting inflation. As Fed Chair, Jerome Powell must focus on strengthening our economy without slamming the brakes on its growth or hurting families already struggling with higher prices."
SenWarren,"Corporations have price gouged consumers for extra profits—and gotten away with it—for too long.
 
Today, @SenatorBaldwin, Rep. @janschakowsky, and I are introducing a new bill to crack down on price gouging and protect consumers. Let’s get it done.
https://t.co/Q4bABJXl37"
SenWarren,"I applaud @Interior's work to prepare this report. I've long supported this effort to address the awful legacy of Indian boarding schools, and I will keep pushing to advance my bill, the Truth &amp; Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies Act, to carry on the work."
SenWarren,"This landmark report from @Interior, released by @SecDebHaaland &amp; @AsstSecNewland, sheds new light on how the federal Indian boarding school policies tragically aided efforts to eliminate Native cultures and identities. This work is an important first step toward healing. https://t.co/oVSs1psQgc"
