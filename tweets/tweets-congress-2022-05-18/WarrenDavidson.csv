WarrenDavidson,"They‚Äôll never concede the point, but at this point everyone knows it‚Äôs true. Well said. https://t.co/vRMbrlyxUr"
WarrenDavidson,"It was an honor for Congress to host Greek Prime Minister @kmitsotakis. And a great day to recall Plato‚Äôs seminal work, ‚ÄúThe Republic‚Äù - not The Democracy."
WarrenDavidson,"Precisely. Bankrupt nations are hard to secure. Don‚Äôt  bankrupt  America!
‚ÄúIn the last two years alone, the United States has [already] borrowed more money than at any time in its history.‚Äù

WarrenDavidson,"I am neither a globalist nor an isolationist. I‚Äôm simply an American, sworn to support and defend America‚Äôs Constitution against all enemies - foreign and domestic. The uniparty‚Äôs top leaders force this false distinction to prevent rational debate &amp; infringe American sovereignty."

WarrenDavidson,Border security is national security. Immigration cannot remain linked to a secure border or sanctuary cities. https://t.co/jJoasMbV6V
WarrenDavidson,"Inflation is hurting #OH08 families. Big spending makes it worse. Big government is still disrupting supply chains. Federal Reserve is way late to the game. Solution: more freedom, less government, #SoundMoney. https://t.co/8O6yKdSlZg"
WarrenDavidson,@ericswalwell @RepThomasMassie People I trust. Tweet-mocked by someone no one should.
WarrenDavidson,"ü§î New strategy? Instead of actually fighting endless wars, Biden Administration settles for funding endless wars? https://t.co/vgsg6xX6Cm"

WarrenDavidson,Which is America‚Äôs most urgent national security threat?
WarrenDavidson,"@PeterMcCormack ""Long march through the institutions..."" Critical theory Marxists took over the Democratic Party and academia. Now working on business, sports, military, etc. Thankfully, not all Democrats, not even all in Congress, agree.  

Obviously, this creates a bit of political tension."
WarrenDavidson,"The passive drift towards war should alarm everyone.

Congressional scrutiny started pretty bipartisan. Out of 43 on the letter to President Biden, 25 were Democrats: https://t.co/VbDMoEWGbs https://t.co/YN2iUoBchu"
WarrenDavidson,".@LeaderHoyer says ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at war.‚Äù #FakeNews We are not at war in Ukraine. Many keep pushing for American participation, but America is not at war. 

Ukraine was unjustly invaded. Some support is fitting. But 5X the rest of world combined?!? With no oversight? https://t.co/hu1PjjVhMo"
WarrenDavidson,WATCH: Update on Ukraine https://t.co/K9p52j1AOL
WarrenDavidson,@HDGregg Predictable. See my 2nd tweet in the thread.

WarrenDavidson,@Jstnorv10 I understand why he attacked Rand Paul with a fallacious argument. Do you?
WarrenDavidson,"@Jstnorv10 No one can rival John McCain‚Äôs thirst for endless war, or his level of support for spying on American citizens. He helped make America less free, less safe, and more burdened by debt."

WarrenDavidson,"New regulatory clarity for stablecoins should recognize the important and substantial distinctions between algorithmic stablecoins (UST), unregulated money market style stablecoins (USDT), and regulated 1:1 fiat &amp; commodity backed stablecoins (eg existing state-based regulation). https://t.co/7Gw7C2qNxq"
WarrenDavidson,"Throughout history, many nations have allowed endless wars to bankrupt them. Bankrupt nations are hard to secure. Don‚Äôt bankrupt America! https://t.co/nO06GzR4Nz"
WarrenDavidson,@1crzydg ü§î So corporate greed lies dormant until?
WarrenDavidson,"Inflation is sophisticated theft. Many don‚Äôt understand that debasing the currency causes inflation. Monetary policy isn‚Äôt even listed as an option. You can say they did it b/c COVID, but inflation was a policy choice.

Fix the money, fix the world.
