USRepKeating,"Honored to meet w/ Greek PM @kmitsotakis as Chair of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe. We discussed Greece's commitment to NATO &amp; hope for stabilization in the Eastern Mediterranean as well as their continued commitment to transatlantic cooperation, among other topics. https://t.co/Jc3HtuxFlP"
USRepKeating,I hope my colleagues will include this important piece of legislation during their debate and help us respond to corruption globally by fighting kleptocracy and defending democracy worldwide.
USRepKeating,"The CROOK Act will:
ⓐ Establish an interagency Anticorruption Task Force
ⓑ Establish an Anti-Corruption Fund for a whole-of-gov approach to countering kleptocracy
ⓒ Designate anti-corruption POCs in U.S. Embassies"
USRepKeating,Today I am leading a letter to the Conferees of the COMPETES Act urging their inclusion of the CROOK Act in the final legislation. The CROOK Act is a bi-partisan bill that has passed out of @HouseForeign and aims to bolster our government’s response to malign action. https://t.co/5l2fqYB8yz
USRepKeating,"There is a process for joining NATO, as defined in Article 10 of the Washington Treaty, that Finland will have to follow, but their accession is not in doubt. We hope that Sweden will quickly follow suit and would strong support their accession to our great alliance as well."
USRepKeating,"In an effort to deter further Russian aggression, I call upon the Biden Administration to urgently convey its support for Helsinki’s transatlantic aspirations and to work with our allies to develop a membership action plan for Finland."
USRepKeating,"What Vladimir Putin will never understand is that forcing countries into an alliance, is not an alliance at all. NATO will always be stronger as our members want to be in the alliance. Threatening countries into some sort of association will never work in the long-term."
USRepKeating,"This major policy shift is a vital measure to advance security in Europe and the world. Finland has chosen to join the alliance, voluntarily, under Russia’s cloud of aggression. The fact of the matter is--Putin’s war of choice in Ukraine compelled Finland to rethink its security."
USRepKeating,"I strongly support Finnish President, Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister, Sanna Marin indicating that Finland will submit an application to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in a historic moment for a country that shares a long border with Russia. https://t.co/cc3Q9YeqyO"
