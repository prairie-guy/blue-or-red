RepChuck,"Great to meet with Dr. Zacharia from @ORNL today! The Oak Ridge National Laboratory supports countless jobs in Oak Ridge and is critical to meeting our nation's technology, energy, health, and security needs.

Always great to see him and his team! https://t.co/2PFUnbhcj3"
RepChuck,"Great to meet with fellow Tennesseans here in DC advocating for resources to end Alzheimer's.

It's crucial to invest in research and development for therapeutics and expanded clinical trials in the hope of one day finding a cure. #EndAlz https://t.co/jUBOVsq439"
RepChuck,"Our right to freedom of speech is inalienable. No government agency or bureaucrat can ever police the speech of any American.

We must remain vigilant and ensure Biden's Administration doesn't attempt to try and censor peoples' speech again. https://t.co/boFNwirRQH"
RepChuck,"As we approach Biden's self-imposed deadline to end Title 42, it's more critical now than ever before that we fully fund ICE.

Today, I highlighted the importance of ensuring ICE has the funds needed to carry out its mission. You can watch below. ⬇️ https://t.co/TZ89499Nu6"
RepChuck,"Nearly 235,000 illegal immigrants were encountered at the border in April alone. 

Biden still plans to lift Title 42 in less than 1-week.

Tennessee and every state will feel the effects of the oncoming uncontrollable surge of illegal migrants. https://t.co/NBJmpXjOp0"
RepChuck,"For the first time ever, gas prices are over $4 in every state.

High gas prices are a policy choice. Biden can:
-end the freeze on oil &amp; gas leases
-restart the Keystone XL pipeline
-stop the regulatory assault on domestic energy

We need to unleash American energy dominance."
RepChuck,"From canceling oil and natural gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska to new regulations on energy production, it's clear that high gas prices are a policy choice of this Admin.

Tennesseans &amp; Americans deserve a better energy policy from DC. https://t.co/U5vV2EirZw"
RepChuck,"Every day, Biden's self-inflicted border crisis grows worse and worse. Thousands of illegal migrants are flooding the border, overwhelming our border patrol.

This crisis will only worsen once the Biden Administration lifts Title 42 later this month. https://t.co/RX05VDkbli"
RepChuck,John Ryder's passing is a loss for our entire state. John was a friend and represented the best of the Tennessee Volunteer spirit throughout his decades-long career. Brenda and I are praying for his family during this difficult time. https://t.co/lsy6Fehmw6
RepChuck,"I am proud to have Michaela on my team! She was a phenomenal intern and is now a great member of my full-time staff in Chattanooga. We are lucky in #TN03 to have her skills, enthusiasm, and sincere patriotic love of country serving our community! https://t.co/i6CMwf2EjH"
RepChuck,"Proud to join @RepTenney to demand that AG Garland follow the law to protect our Supreme Court Justices as they do their job.

It's clear that 'protestors' targeting Justices at their homes are doing so to threaten them out of the draft Roe opinion. This lawlessness cannot stand. https://t.co/6MCxJY49yh"
RepChuck,"""The producer price index, which tracks how much manufacturers get for products at their initial sale, rose 0.5% on the month and 11% from a year ago.""

When costs go up, they are inevitably passed on to shoppers. The endless social spending by Biden must end to stop inflation. https://t.co/xwfXBI4T65"
RepChuck,"This week, we celebrate #NationalPoliceWeek and honor the men and women who serve and protect us every day.

On behalf of all of East Tennessee, thank you to every police officer and law enforcement member. As long as I am in Congress, I will always #BacktheBlue! https://t.co/ZNUrpZnGhi"
RepChuck,"While TN families struggle to find formula to feed their babies, the Biden Admin is shipping palettes of formula to the border.

Biden's open border policies and prioritization of illegal immigrants over American citizens is wrong. https://t.co/lL7cArZmXL"
RepChuck,"The reality of open borders.

Law enforcement and border patrol are overwhelmed. It will only get worse once Biden ends Title 42 later this month. https://t.co/fv1cYkvTdK"
RepChuck,"The Biden Administration just canceled three major oil and gas lease sales in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.

Pain at the pump and high utility bills aren't because of Putin. It's a policy choice of this Administration."
