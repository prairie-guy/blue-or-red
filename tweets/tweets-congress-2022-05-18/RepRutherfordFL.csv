RepRutherfordFL,"Tonight I got to meet my favorite Oscar winner, @TroyKotsur of CODA. I thank him and all those who advocate on behalf of the Deaf community. 

As Co-Chair of the Congressional Deaf Caucus, I will continue working with my colleagues to increase equity for Deaf individuals. https://t.co/2TYysD3OBn"
