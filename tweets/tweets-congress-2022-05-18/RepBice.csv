RepBice,"It is critical that we solve the baby formula crisis, hold the Biden admin accountable and ensure this will not happen again. Proud to introduce the Babies Need Formula Now Act with @RepStefanik, @cathymcmorris &amp; @RepAshleyHinson. Read more in @FoxNews üëá

RepBice,".@GOPLeader is right. Rising gas prices and inflation are hurting hard-working Oklahomans, costing them thousands more. Instead of shifting blame, we need to find tangible solutions for these crises. https://t.co/nyBwy13kby"

RepBice,"Last week, I visited Seminole in #OK05 to see firsthand the storm damage. I met with local leaders and Seminole residents to learn more about the situation and see how my staff and I can continue to provide assistance after the devastating tornadoes. https://t.co/sjQg7pCg8h"
RepBice,This is a big win for the country. @HouseGOP will always stand for freedom of speech and against this Orwellian attempt by the Biden admin. https://t.co/5OMYgdfB4n
RepBice,"Yet another record by the Biden admin. We must restore policies that allowed America to be energy independent just 2 years ago. It's simple. Let states like Oklahoma increase production and meet our nation's needs. This ultimately will lower fuel prices.

RepBice,"More good news for Oklahoma, my legislation the Workforce and Education Partnership Act passed the U.S. House as an amendment today. This legislation expands programs to allow funding for employers and educational institutions to create training programs for high-demand jobs."
RepBice,"This is what @CBP deals with every day. Our officers are overwhelmed. Sadly, this humanitarian crisis is only going to get worse when Biden eliminates Title 42. We must secure our southern border. https://t.co/a3if6yOc6u"
RepBice,"Breaking üö®Dems once again voted against a measure from @HouseGOP to consider the American Energy Independence from Russia Act. Instead of playing the blame game, this legislation would actually solve the root issues of Biden's self-inflicted energy crisis. Unbelievable!"
RepBice,"The President is finally acting on this crisis, and he‚Äôs taken solutions from @HouseGOP. This initiative mirrors the Formula Act, legislation I introduced with my friend @RepFeenstra. Thanks for taking a page out of the Republican playbook. https://t.co/1JWCglvzsR"

I will always #BackTheBlue and support the brave men and women who risk their lives to protect Americans. #NationalPoliceWeek https://t.co/y45u72Cedp"
RepBice,".@johnrobertsFox is right. The FDA must establish standards to regulate infant formula to ensure that we can safely import formula from other countries in times of domestic shortages. My bill with @RepFeenstra, the Formula Act, does just that.

RepBice,"Biden plans to lift Title 42 a week from today. His own @DHSgov estimates that this could cause illegal crossings to jump to 18,000 per day. The #BidenBorderCrisis is already out of control and overwhelming our @CBP officers. Revoking Title 42 will make this crisis even worse."
RepBice,The Biden Admin refuses to admit that their failed policies have contributed to the numerous crises facing our nation. Playing the blame game will get us no where. It's time to work on real solutions to solve the real problems that are negatively impacting all Americans.
RepBice,"#ICYMI üö® I spoke at a @HouseGOP press conference last week about the baby formula shortage crisis and the urgent need for action on @RepFeensta and my bill, the Formula Act.
