RepCawthorn,"Great to see honor flights back at DCA!

I was honored last week to join @RepChipRoy in calling for the reinstatement of vehicular escort services from the @usparkpolicepio for honor flights.

Thank you veterans for risking your lives to keep our country safe, secure, and free! https://t.co/wcO7XuzIvz"
RepCawthorn,"First, they defunded the police. Then they ignored theft. 

Now Dems are literally using tax dollars to encourage the addicted to double down on their vices.

Enabling addiction isnâ€™t compassionate.

Our crime-ravaged cities deserve so much better.

RepCawthorn,"Today, I introduced legislation requiring the CDC to include aborted children in death rate statistics. 

This preventable cause of death (abortions) would rank in the top 5 causes of death if they were included in calculations.

RepCawthorn,"""Spc. Luis Herrera, 23, of Marion, died April 28, 2022, after a military vehicle crash at Fort Bragg.

'He was somebody that I always had in my life,' Ishman Martino said of the man he considered a brother.""

A heartbreaking loss for NC and the nation.
