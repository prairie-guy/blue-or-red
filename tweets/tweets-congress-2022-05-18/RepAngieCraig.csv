RepAngieCraig,A four-year college degree isn’t for everyone &amp; there are millions of good-paying jobs available for folks without a bachelor's degree. Glad to see career &amp; technical education get the recognition it deserves as a great choice for millions of Americans. https://t.co/XEmoAyFcMt
RepAngieCraig,"I continue to prioritize lowering costs for working families, and I won't stop until price and supply chain pressures have been resolved."
RepAngieCraig,"Today, the House Ag Committee passed a series of bills aimed at lowering the price of food and easing food/ag supply chain pressure. I was proud to support them, including ones to decrease concentration and address rising input costs."
RepAngieCraig,"This Friday at noon, I’ll be hosting my May Town Hall focused on the rising cost of prescription drugs &amp; health care. If you would like to join, you can dial in at 833-364-1471 – or submit your questions in advance here: https://t.co/x1tP2R5TnA"
RepAngieCraig,I’m grateful for the compassionate and selfless work the folks at United Way’s Suicide Prevention team do to care for our community and those who live here. Glad I could chat with them today about the important work they are doing. https://t.co/dUG7Gys1Tl
RepAngieCraig,"I’m pleased my staff was able to show our appreciation for the officers at the Dakota County Sheriff's Office yesterday by bringing them cookies to celebrate #NationalPoliceWeek. Thanks for everything you do, @DakotaMNSheriff! https://t.co/IOeL8hCkC6"
RepAngieCraig,Members of Congress should be focused on improving the lives of their constituents – not lining up a high-paying lobbying job for after their time in public service. It’s time we passed this commonsense reform and restored some faith in Washington. https://t.co/FH9a0iscrl
RepAngieCraig,"Public works professionals keep our communities clean, safe and functional – and rarely get the recognition they deserve. Glad to join @RepDinaTitus &amp; @RepBrianFitz in acknowledging those workers by officially declaring #NationalPublicWorksWeek. https://t.co/bLBvOZbyOx https://t.co/btZqwPu1p3"
RepAngieCraig,Proud to announce that our bill to support families like Katie’s will receive a vote on the House floor during #NationalPoliceWeek! This is the right thing to do to support those who put their lives on the line for our communities. https://t.co/ALPfYAQmOK
RepAngieCraig,I stopped by the Inver Grove Heights Police Department today during #NationalPoliceWeek to say thank you to officers for serving our community. It’s great to hear how we can better support them as they work to keep our communities safe. https://t.co/eNrmJnPamK
RepAngieCraig,This picture was taken at a gas station in #MN02 this week. Can you believe E15 is 50¢ cheaper than regular unleaded gas?  This is exactly why I pushed @POTUS so hard to lift the summertime ban on E15 sales and provide a cheaper option at the pump for Minnesotans. https://t.co/tQ789Rud8G
RepAngieCraig,"As co-chair of the bipartisan Supply Chain Caucus, as well as a mom &amp; grandmother, I am taking this very seriously and working alongside my colleagues to identify solutions and keep our little ones well-fed. https://t.co/Rzc1rQtSpQ"
RepAngieCraig,I joined my colleagues on the House steps today in support of reproductive rights and individual freedoms. Women should have autonomy over their own bodies and be able to make their own health care decisions. We need to protect Roe now. https://t.co/1hn0Iufoch
RepAngieCraig,"Good. I’ll hold you to that @SenSchumer. Americans should be able to trust that their representatives are working for them, not their portfolios. https://t.co/jkispRWxc1"
RepAngieCraig,"Today, during #PoliceWeek, I joined a group of Democrats &amp; Republicans to encourage action on the Invest to Protect Act, a bill to support small and medium sized police departments with training, equipment and mental health resources.

It's time to bring this bill up for a vote. https://t.co/ybJYPcdM4e"
RepAngieCraig,"Every day, law enforcement officers put their lives on the line to protect others from harm. During #NationalPoliceWeek, we honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice while serving their communities – and thank all of those still working so bravely to keep us safe. https://t.co/4H41BLgkyB"
RepAngieCraig,"For years, politicians have treated the Capitol like a revolving door by using their elected positions for personal profit after leaving office. To restore faith in DC, I introduced a bill to ban lawmakers from working as lobbyists after leaving office. https://t.co/2RmJ4se65l"
RepAngieCraig,"No Minnesotan should go hungry. Thank you to Second Harvest Heartland for meeting with me to discuss efforts to address food insecurity in #MN02. And more importantly, thank you for your important work! https://t.co/bmChotlaJO"
RepAngieCraig,Why am I not surprised? Working families in Minnesota shouldn’t have to spend hours poring over their returns or months waiting for a refund if they’re simple enough to fit on a postcard. https://t.co/Zb9acaw6w2
