RepGosar,Did anyone else notice how quickly they dropped the 'build back better' nonsense once they made everything objectively worse?
RepGosar,"Record high gas prices and inflation are crushing our families, homeless veterans, and senior citizens with fixed incomes. Knowing this, RINOs and Democrats voted to send $40 billion to Ukraine anyway."
RepGosar,Biden's Regime is treating illegal aliens (criminals) better than our own citizens. This goes far beyond incompetence - this is malice.
RepGosar,Those who fight for America the hardest get attacked the most.
RepGosar,"When we take power, and we will, never forget how these monsters treated the January 6th political prisoners."

RepGosar,"DC globalists focus on ‚Äúhuman rights,‚Äù ‚Äúregional strategy,‚Äù and ‚Äúforeign security‚Äù while our own border is open to criminals, terrorists, drug cartels, and human trafficking. I always put America First. They prefer America Last."

RepGosar,"Our movement must never forget that our struggle is of a spiritual nature. Satan would much rather have us be demoralized, distracted, &amp; compromised - this is exactly why we must stay focused and never give up!

Christ is King!"
RepGosar,"Apparently, we're only supposed to be 'fiscally conservative' when it comes to helping the American People. Over $30 trillion in national debt, record high costs of practically everything, but God forbid we vote NO on tossing $40 billion to Ukraine."
RepGosar,"The war in Iraq was a mistake.
A proxy war with Russia is a mistake too, and could potentially lead to world-ending consequences. This shouldn't be controversial, a proxy war with Russia to uphold a corrupt socialist oligarchy is simply not in America's interest."
RepGosar,"Total US help to Ukraine will soon be around $54 billion. At this point, it's inaccurate to say that we're not at war with Russia by proxy. NO MORE!"
RepGosar,"Remember when democrats and RINOs nickel and dimed President Trump on wall funding? They all said ""oh no, heaven forbid, we can't afford $8 billion. Maybe we will give you $2 billion."" But Ukraine? Open the money spigot! It's always America Last with these clowns."
