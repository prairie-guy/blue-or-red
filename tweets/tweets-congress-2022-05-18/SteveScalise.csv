SteveScalise,"Reminder: Just a few weeks ago Biden's Homeland Security Secretary testified under oath that we have ""operational control"" of the border.

They're blatantly lying to you.

Will the disinformation board be addressing this? https://t.co/HimayD9roZ"
SteveScalise,"Gas prices are already at record highs.

And Biden just canceled oil and gas lease sales in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.

That means ZERO lease sales for American oil and gas in federal waters this year.

This is all intentional.

It was always part of their plan. https://t.co/WMsSYmZWVZ"
SteveScalise,"Police officers put their own lives on the line to serve and protect our communities every single day.

For me, it's personal. They saved my life when I was shot by a leftist gunman.

We must never let liberals defund them.

SteveScalise,"They told you Covid couldnâ€™t have come from a lab.

They told you the Steele Dossier was legit.

They told you looters were peaceful protestors.

They told you the Hunter Biden story was fake.

Now the same people have started a ""disinformation board.""

They have no credibility. https://t.co/AumwxhMe31"
