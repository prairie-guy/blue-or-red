SenJeffMerkley,"Congress must act on gun violence and aggressively confront the white supremacist terrorism that fuels racist violence. I will continue to fight for meaningful legislation on gun safety reform, and to hold perpetrators of white supremacist violence accountable."
SenJeffMerkley,MAGA politicians who gin up hate and parrot white supremacist “replacement theory” for political gain should be held responsible for the violence they inspire. I hope the American people will choose leaders who encourage understanding and dialogue instead.
SenJeffMerkley,"White supremacist violence is domestic terrorism. Period. 
We need to recognize this and hold those committing horrific violence in the name of white supremacy accountable."

SenJeffMerkley,@RepBonamici Learn more about the Alan Reinstein Ban Asbestos Now Act ⬇️https://t.co/U8bZ5VRaBS
SenJeffMerkley,"We’ve known for generations that asbestos is lethal, yet some industries’ profits have been valued over the lives of firefighters, construction workers, and other Americans exposed to this toxic substance. @RepBonamici and I are fighting to ban asbestos once and for all. https://t.co/FdyTrykGIa"
SenJeffMerkley,"Thrilled to see a Salmon SuperHwy project over the weekend, which when complete will remove barriers and reconnect 180 miles of salmon habitat. I’m glad @RonWyden and I secured investments for climate-resilient, community-focused projects like this in the spending bill. https://t.co/1AVlYcAVpU"
SenJeffMerkley,Had the pleasure to meet with @ZinMarAungNUG yesterday. She's a courageous advocate and I stand with her and the Burmese people in rejecting the military’s coup and brutal tactics.

Glad @RonWyden and I could secure funding to preserve this important affordable housing complex in the spending package. https://t.co/NhiM1yVbsk"
SenJeffMerkley,It’s long past time we stopped letting the gun industry run the Senate. We’ve got to reform the filibuster to pass these critical measures. I will continue to fight to get this done.
SenJeffMerkley,"Far too many families and communities have been devastated by gun violence, and Congress has failed to enact meaningful, commonsense gun safety reforms."
SenJeffMerkley,"We all should be able to move freely—to worship, to go to the grocery store, or to attend school—without fear of gun violence. My heart is with members of Geneva Presbyterian Church, Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church and the Taiwanese community targeted by this horrific crime. https://t.co/AVooMsqWCx"

https://t.co/5PaTuqY6a3"
SenJeffMerkley,"Our dependence on oil and gas enriches our enemies, causes pain at the pump, and fuels climate chaos. It’s a huge national security risk, which is why I introduced a Senate Resolution urging a swift, bold transition to renewable energy. https://t.co/l3ilAdXjY2"
SenJeffMerkley,I’m thrilled that @RonWyden and I could secure funding to support this mission with the addition of an outdoor classroom. I wish I could have brought my kids here when they were little!

SenJeffMerkley,"It sickens me that Abbott, which controls a huge share of the formula market, has a pattern of seeming more concerned with shareholders than they are with families—spending billions on stock buybacks instead of addressing production issues. We need to put people before profits."
SenJeffMerkley,"If you’re a parent or caregiver struggling to find formula, @hhsgov has set up a site to connect parents to formula and other resources. https://t.co/L2IBaIGxw8"
SenJeffMerkley,"I’d do anything to keep my kids healthy and safe, and I know other parents feel the same. I see the pain and uncertainty of families across the county as they read headline after headline and see empty shelves in their grocery stores where rows of formula should be."
SenJeffMerkley,I look forward to both sides taking steps to strengthen our partnership.
SenJeffMerkley,"Last week, I met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. After years of senseless conflict, it is heartening to see our two countries work together on a number of issues from addressing our shared legacies of war to tackling climate chaos. https://t.co/Z5kGcIOLeB"

https://t.co/ePF16qw0S4"
SenJeffMerkley,"Funding I secured with @RonWyden will patch up immediate problems, including restoring the electric power line, but we need to push for long term solutions. I will keep fighting to make it happen, so we can strengthen and protect our coho, steelhead, and chinook returns."

SenJeffMerkley,Republicans are sharpening their attacks on student debt cancelation because they know it’s a popular proposal that will help working families—in red and blue states alike. I’ll continue to push the Biden administration to #CancelStudentDebt—we can’t afford to wait.
SenJeffMerkley,Horrific news from Buffalo today. Lives stolen and families ripped apart by senseless gun violence. How many more lives will be stolen before our nation confronts this hatred and the nonsensical gun laws that allow it to become so deadly? https://t.co/tfv5Q7IIEf
SenJeffMerkley,"With anti-Asian hate crimes on the rise across the country and in our own communities in Oregon, I joined @ORriseabovehate to send a clear message: bigotry and racism have no home in Oregon or anywhere. #RiseAboveHate https://t.co/tbl6c0SbDo"
SenJeffMerkley,I stand with @PPAdvocatesOR and all those fighting to protect access to abortion care and birth control for everyone in our country. https://t.co/Za4MEB4nFy
SenJeffMerkley,We must also recognize the sharp rise in anti-Asian hate crimes in recent years and recommit to recognizing and standing against bigotry in all its forms. Everyone should be able to participate in their communities safely and without fear. https://t.co/gy95TLSYFk
SenJeffMerkley,"May is Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, when we celebrate the members of this diverse community and the innumerable impacts they make in Oregon and the whole country every day of the year. #AAPIHeritageMonth"
SenJeffMerkley,The majority of people who hold student debt didn’t attend a fancy school—nearly 40% of those folks don’t even have a college degree. Canceling student debt is about leveling the playing field for working families across the country. I’m working to get it done. #CancelStudentDebt
SenJeffMerkley,"Nearly 90% of young people in America support action on student debt cancelation, because higher education should open the doors to opportunity, not weigh our young people down with years of debt. I’m in full agreement—and I’m pushing to #CancelStudentDebt

SenJeffMerkley,"Reports that @Starbucks is withholding increased benefits from workers trying to unionize are extremely disturbing. I joined Senate colleagues to press Howard Schultz on these alarming reports. We need to make organizing at work easier, not harder. https://t.co/uFlZZon4We"
SenJeffMerkley,Oil and gas companies are raking in record profits as Americans feel pain at the gas pump. We need a windfall profits tax: to take money from profiteering Big Oil and give it back to consumers! And we need to quickly chart a path toward our renewable energy future. https://t.co/4AbB4Z3U2o
SenJeffMerkley,"It is painful to recognize that the same hatred faced by the workers who build this railway more than a hundred years ago persists today.

We have work to do to recognize and root out bigotry, to reaffirm that discrimination has no place in our communities."

I voted NO on his nomination today."
