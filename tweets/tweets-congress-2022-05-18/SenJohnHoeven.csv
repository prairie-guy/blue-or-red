SenJohnHoeven,We worked to secure this assistance to help our ag producers recover from the historic drought that impacted much of North Dakota and at a time when input costs are rising + ensure this program works for our farmers and that signup can go quickly. https://t.co/ZhhISvqf8D
SenJohnHoeven,"Big news: Row crop disaster assistance signup will begin in late May with assistance to start going out in June. Producers will begin receiving their pre-filled applications in the next couple of weeks, which they can sign and return to their local FSA county offices."

SenJohnHoeven,Gas prices have hit an all-time high. It’s long-past time for the Biden administration to get out of the way and take the handcuffs off American energy.
