RepTimBurchett,"The UFO hearing this morning was a total joke. We should have heard from people who could talk about things they'd personally seen, but instead the witnesses were government officials with limited knowledge who couldn't give real answers to serious questions. https://t.co/hddRYupW3u"

RepTimBurchett,"I made two points on the House floor about the Supreme Court's draft ruling on Roe v. Wade:

1. Whoever leaked the decision to the press must be held accountable.

RepTimBurchett,"I called on the Tennessee and U.S. Attorneys General to demand they investigate any potential price gouging related to baby formula. This nationwide shortage is devastating East Tennessee families, and anyone who tries to profit off this crisis needs to be held accountable. https://t.co/Jp5sAQLPAD"
