RepDrewFerguson,"Great to be with you today! 

If we invest in #AntibioticResistance and pandemic preparedness to correct market failures now, we can save millions of lives and #SquashSuperbugs later.

The PASTEUR Act will accomplish just that. https://t.co/KcslsGt6X6"
RepDrewFerguson,"A big win!

Following strong opposition from @HouseGOP &amp; backlash from the American people, Biden is finally abandoning his ""Disinformation Governance Board"" idea.
 
DHS should focus on combatting terrorism and securing our border, not suppressing our First Amendment rights. https://t.co/skrvwiqrCc"
RepDrewFerguson,"It was great speaking with Pike Middle School students this morning in D.C. to discuss my job as their Congressman and service to the 3rd District of Georgia.
 
Thank you for your insightful questions, and I hope you have an outstanding rest of your trip to our nation’s Capital! https://t.co/WyRng9x1kw"
RepDrewFerguson,"I've long advocated for workforce development &amp; apprenticeships.

Unfortunately, Democrats' Workforce Innovation &amp; Opportunity Act (WIOA) prioritizes unionizing &amp; reporting requirements over enacting critical reforms to these programs.

This is not the bill Americans need. https://t.co/fum99b79Zb"
RepDrewFerguson,"As a strong supporter of our law enforcement, I joined @VernBuchanan in calling on @SpeakerPelosi to bring the Thin Blue Line Act to the Floor for a vote.

This critical bill would enhance federal punishment for the murder or attempted murder of a police officer. #BacktheBlue https://t.co/6d7xhS3WKp"
RepDrewFerguson,"Heartbreaking news out of Troup County this weekend.
 
Lifting the families and loved ones of the players and all others involved up in prayer. https://t.co/8UhsXsXmZ9"
RepDrewFerguson,"Joe Biden buys crack pipes, and Nancy Pelosi is opening liquor stores in Congress. 

Just what Americans want. https://t.co/UWtsKKASAx"

RepDrewFerguson,"Americans can’t afford to buy groceries or put gas in their cars, and Nancy Pelosi decides now is a good time to open a congressional liquor store on Capitol Hill. 

And yes, your tax dollars can be used for purchases.  

Washington Dems couldn’t be more out of touch. #FirePelosi https://t.co/IRBup7OOtf"
RepDrewFerguson,"Baby formula shortages are an urgent problem that must be addressed immediately.

That's why I joined House Republicans in calling on the Biden Administration to do more to help parents across our country before this crisis gets worse. https://t.co/LQ1rqIXuFQ"
RepDrewFerguson,"In Biden’s America, you can get government funded crack pipes, but you can’t find baby formula.

This is egregious and unacceptable. 
https://t.co/spghArhYUF"
RepDrewFerguson,"Gas prices are at record highs, &amp; the Biden Admin's response is to cancel a critical oil &amp; gas lease in America.

Joe Biden is determined to destroy our nation's energy independence.

Democrats don't care if that means Americans can’t afford to fill up their gas tanks.

Shameful! https://t.co/frWRgBhuHw"
