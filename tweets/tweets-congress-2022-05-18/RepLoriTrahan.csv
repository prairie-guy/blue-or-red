RepLoriTrahan,"The baby formula crisis is affecting thousands of Massachusetts families.

Yesterday, I demanded answers from a formula company that has decreased production &amp; made the shortage worse.

Today, I voted to expand access for families who purchase formula using WIC."
RepLoriTrahan,This is huge: Two bipartisan bills I introduced to help address the addiction crisis and prevent youth suicides were just approved by the @EnergyCommerce Committee! These bills are now headed to the floor for final passage! More on one of those bills⬇️ https://t.co/gsYbzAtmjQ
RepLoriTrahan,"The Circle Street Bridge and Water Street Bridge projects in Fitchburg have been delayed for too long. The #BipartisanInfrastructureLaw is going to get these critical projects done, and it's going to do the same in communities across the Commonwealth! https://t.co/0zhMFYJ8UT"
RepLoriTrahan,"America succeeds when we make more critical goods right here at home.

American families are relying on us to combat shortages and bolster supply chains so that they can access the everyday goods they need to get by.

We need the bipartisan #AmericaCOMPETES Act."
RepLoriTrahan,"The baby formula shortage has reached crisis level for thousands of families across Massachusetts, especially folks relying on WIC. I just partnered with @RepKClark, @RepPressley &amp; the Massachusetts Delegation to demand answers from Abbott Nutrition. https://t.co/htkFAN4EpQ"
RepLoriTrahan,"If you think overturning Roe is the end-goal of anti-choice extremists, you're wrong. Republicans are already talking about criminalizing birth control and post-miscarriage care.

We can't let them turn back the clock on reproductive rights."
RepLoriTrahan,"This morning, I had the honor to speak with @SBSPanthers 8th grade civics and social studies classes about my job as their representative. So grateful for the opportunity to meet these brilliant students who have such bright futures ahead of them. https://t.co/0cM6SGUK7j"
RepLoriTrahan,"The #BipartisanInfrastructureLaw is rebuilding bridges across Massachusetts. In Fitchburg, $20 million will be used to repair and replace the Circle Street &amp; Bridge Street Bridges. Proud to secure these federal funds and work with our state &amp; local partners to put them to use! https://t.co/64BAxojzF7"
RepLoriTrahan,"@ragelsaurus That’s an absolutely unacceptable response, and I’m very sorry that happened. I just followed you if you’d like to send me a DM so I can get to the bottom of this and make sure you get the answer you deserve."
RepLoriTrahan,"Lowering out of pocket costs for families is my top priority.

We’ve voted to cap insulin costs at $35 a month.
We’ve voted to lower health care costs.
We’ve voted to extend the child tax credit.

Senate Republicans have blocked every one of those bills."
RepLoriTrahan,You have to beat the best to be the best. Down go the defending champs and we’re on to Miami! https://t.co/ZE9ARGkHfy
RepLoriTrahan,I’m devastated for the innocent victims and their families in Buffalo. This act of domestic terrorism was designed to strike fear into the lives of Black residents and communities of color across the nation. White supremacy and hate-fueled violence have no place in America.
RepLoriTrahan,Massive meatpacking corporations have lied about meat shortages time and time again. They did it during the pandemic and they're using similar excuses to pump up families' grocery prices now. https://t.co/Zne6RrT9W7
RepLoriTrahan,You won’t find a single Republican standing here. That’s because every single one of them voted against abortion protections for every woman in America. No one will forget. https://t.co/zwHhRc6K6P
RepLoriTrahan,"We know oil corporations are driving up prices at the pump so they can rake in record-setting profits. Next week, I'll vote to hold them accountable by passing the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act.

No more profiting off working families' pain.

RepLoriTrahan,"It's not just Republicans in Congress who are blocking investigations into corporate price-gouging. It's also happening at our federal agencies. Now that we have a full @FTC, it can go after giant energy &amp; food corporations that have been hiking prices on working families. https://t.co/aF6eQ4jpli"
RepLoriTrahan,"I don't want my two young girls to grow up in an America where they have fewer rights than their brothers. Today, I asked my colleagues how they can look their own daughters in the eyes and explain their support for taking away reproductive rights. ⤵️ https://t.co/kJ7Q3WUNbK"
RepLoriTrahan,"When I visited the Ukrainian border, I promised our allies on the ground that the United States would stand by them no matter what. I voted for the Ukrainian aid package because I plan on fulfilling that pledge until Putin is defeated.
