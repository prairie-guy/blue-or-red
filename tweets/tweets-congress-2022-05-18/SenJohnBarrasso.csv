SenJohnBarrasso,Wyoming will be well represented at the @DOE_SC_NSB National Finals by the students at Lander Valley HS. Congratulations to the team and staff at @LanderSchools and good luck! Wyoming is proud of you. #NSB2022 https://t.co/6IGrkW0qfs
SenJohnBarrasso,The American people are paying the highest prices for gas ever. People understand that we have the energy in the ground in the United States &amp; Pres. Biden will not let us get it out. Americans are convinced @POTUS doesn’t have any solutions to get rid of this pain at the pump. https://t.co/3joiITiz0p
SenJohnBarrasso,One day @JoeBiden said higher gas prices were due to Putin’s price hike but the very next day he cancelled oil and gas lease sales. The American people see through this. Joe Biden has lost all credibility in terms of his ability to deal with inflation and the cost of energy. https://t.co/zVljd8zMqQ
SenJohnBarrasso,"Today is the 8th day in a row that gas prices in America hit a new high. @POTUS is committed to high gas prices for the long future. That's why 3 out of 4 Americans this weekend polled that they believed the country, Joe Biden and the Democrats are heading in the wrong direction. https://t.co/Yl6JSY0YT0"
SenJohnBarrasso,"Alberta Premier @JKenney told the Energy Committee today that if @POTUS hadn’t canceled #KeystoneXL, Canada could have replaced Russian oil by moving 800,000 barrels plus per day. https://t.co/eu8ZTxSx4Y"
SenJohnBarrasso,"President Biden’s policies are placing the U.S. &amp; Canadian partnership at risk. Not satisfied with harming Canadian energy, @POTUS and his appointees are doing everything possible to discourage American energy production. https://t.co/LEgQBU2Lh8"
