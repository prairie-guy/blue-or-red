RepSchneider,"On to you, @SenatorDurbin"
RepSchneider,Just passed the House with a bipartisan vote! Onto the Senate. https://t.co/giQcbu3fg5
RepSchneider,"There will be more shooters like those in Buffalo, in El Paso, and at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We cannot sit idly by as domestic violence extremism spreads across our country.

We must take action. Tonight, we will pass the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act. https://t.co/ALvDepKyNh"
RepSchneider,"The House condemned rising antisemitism today in a strong bipartisan vote. 

I was honored to get to celebrate the vote with @deborahlipstadt, our Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism. https://t.co/nTyhPfjpda"
RepSchneider,"Tonight, the House votes on legislation - the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act -  to send a message that we stand with federal law enforcement, we stand with American communities, and we stand against domestic terrorism. https://t.co/DNYh6UPBmj"
RepSchneider,"The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act we are voting on today is the right bill for this specific moment. I am proud of this piece of legislation, which I have shepherded with Senator Durbin since 2017. https://t.co/jBbz48bgaF"
RepSchneider,Proud to have great constituents like Jeanne Polydoris and Yianni Konstantinou with me today for the Greek Prime Ministerâ€™s address to Congress. https://t.co/OFxFs75T0y
RepSchneider,"In the wake of the Buffalo shooting, we stand united as a nation. Thatâ€™s why we must as a nation take action to identify these threats of domestic terrorism and track them and try to prevent them before they happen.

RepSchneider,"I am confident that the House can pass this historic, bipartisan legislation to tackle the greatest threat to Americans today: domestic violent extremism."
RepSchneider,"Iâ€™m calling on Speaker Pelosi to bring the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act to a vote on the House floor this week. In 2020, this bill passed the House on a voice vote with overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle."
RepSchneider,"The government and law enforcement have failed to catch these signs, just as CongressÂ has failed to appropriately combat domestic terrorism. As a result, ten people, most of them Black, are dead at a Buffalo supermarket. We cannot continue making excuses."
RepSchneider,"In the case of the Buffalo shooting, law enforcement had the warning signs. The shooter had previously threatenedÂ his high school. He had been sent for a mental health evaluation. He was radicalized by social media and he leveraged it to spread his own hateful beliefs."
RepSchneider,We need to ensure that federalÂ law enforcement has the resources they need to bestÂ preemptively identify and thwart extremist violence wherever the threat appears.
RepSchneider,"â€“ to prevent future California shootings, future El Paso shootings, future Charleston shootings,Â future Pittsburgh shootings,Â future Wisconsin shootings."
RepSchneider,"Congress canâ€™t stop Tucker CarlsonÂ from spewingÂ hateful, dangerous â€˜replacement theoryâ€™ ideology. Congress hasnâ€™t been able to ban the sale of assault weapons. The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act is what Congress CAN do this week to try to prevent future Buffalo shootings. ðŸ§µ"
RepSchneider,I canâ€™t help but think that the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act would help law enforcement with stopping specifically this kind of crime.
RepSchneider,"Todayâ€™s horrific shooting is heartbreaking and brutal, with 10 people murdered and three more wounded. My deepest condolences go out to the victimsâ€™ families and I am praying for full recovery of those hurt. Tonight we all stand with Buffalo.

RepSchneider,"I continue to pray for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as all people throughout the region.  I remain committed to seeking pathways, such as the historic Abraham Accords, to promote coexistence, mutual respect and shared prosperity."
RepSchneider,"Israel must investigate the events surrounding the funeral, including the actions of its police officers, and take corrective action to prevent such situations in the future."
RepSchneider,"I was also disturbed by the scenes at her funeral, including video of people throwing objects at the procession and of police brutally assaulting mourners."
RepSchneider,"I join the Administration in condemning Abu Aklehâ€™s killing and call for a full and complete investigation of her death, and holding to account those responsible. This can only be achieved with cooperation between Palestinian  and Israeli authorities."
RepSchneider,"I want to extend my condolences to the family, community and coworkers of Al Jazeera journalist, and Palestinian American, Shireen Abu Akleh.  The death of any journalist in the line of duty is a tragedy. ðŸ§µ"

RepSchneider,"This National Police Week, take time to remember the law enforcement officers who have been lost in the line of duty.

At their best, our police officers are heroes. Thank you to all of our officers who put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities. https://t.co/5CJZHVSwnv"
RepSchneider,I'm calling on the Senate to work together to protect women across the country. We cannot afford to backslide. We must preserve access to safe medical procedures and respect women's bodily autonomy. https://t.co/ojvDBVp4rB
RepSchneider,"In the House, we passed the Women's Health Protection Act to codify Roe. Across the Capitol yesterday, 51 Senators turned their back on women's rights and voted against this legislation. It is shameful. https://t.co/Vg2yLNlJLW"
