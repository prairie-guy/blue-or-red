SenTinaSmith,"Huge crowd today at the @PPFA rally in St. Paul. 

This is exactly the type of energy and organizing we need in the fight for reproductive rights. It’s impossible to lose hope in moments like this. https://t.co/NQAsZOEevu"
SenTinaSmith,"So fun touring the @AIOIC to learn about their plans to use the $350,000 in federal funding I worked to secure.

They're developing a training program in heavy equipment operation and elder care to connect people who lost their jobs during the pandemic to new work opportunities. https://t.co/LTfy47EwJE"
SenTinaSmith,"Loved stopping by the @Sannehfdn today to learn more about how they'll benefit from the $223,000 in federal funding @SenAmyKlobuchar and I helped secure.

They're doing incredible work around after-school programming, mental health support and addressing food insecurity. https://t.co/vBB6GsvqbV"
SenTinaSmith,"Exciting announcement today with @MayorCarter and @MayorFrey – the Twin Cities will have 170+ vehicles as part of the @eviecarshare service and 70 renewably-powered charging stations. 

Minnesota continues to lead in the transition to clean energy. https://t.co/oHPfTB2boc"
SenTinaSmith,"I'm proud to be the only U.S. Senator to have worked for @PPFA and look forward to speaking at their rally tomorrow in St. Paul.

We cannot control the Supreme Court's decision but we can organize and continue fighting for reproductive freedom. And fight, we will."
SenTinaSmith,"Moving Crypto into 401(k)s is far too risky, and this week’s rollercoaster ride shows why. Inserting risky assets into retirement portfolios is a recipe for disaster.
