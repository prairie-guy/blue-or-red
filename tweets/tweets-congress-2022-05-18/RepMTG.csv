RepMTG,We all know what domestic terrorist means to Democrats: anyone who stands in their way in their lustful quest for power https://t.co/WpFbFKB6sh
RepMTG,"Remember when America went to war in Iraq bc of ‚Äúweapons of mass destruction?‚Äù

Fentanyl is a weapon of mass destruction.

And the number 1 cause of death of Americans ages 18-45, over 100K people now!

But Biden refuses to protect Americans from this weapon of mass destruction."
RepMTG,"The DC Jail is an absolute disgrace.

Today, @replouiegohmert and I hand-delivered a letter to @MayorBowser demanding answers and an immediate tour of the jail to conduct Congressional oversight. https://t.co/HH0MSxUqqh"
RepMTG,Was Kathleen Landerkin ever fired from her job as Deputy Warden of the DC Jail? https://t.co/y3FWynC0zP
RepMTG,"I hear Martin Shkreli has been released, having paid his debt to society. 

2016 energy everywhere you look!"
RepMTG,"HOW does the press know about this terrorist plot to burn down the Supreme Court and murder Justices?

And Members of Congress do not know.

Is it because Biden‚Äôs new @PressSec is sleeping with a CNN National Corespondent? https://t.co/Aar6Mb0LRs"
RepMTG,"Finally @TaylorLorenz does actual journalism.

Plus amazing connections to ‚Äúsources‚Äù inside Biden‚Äôs DHS that Taylor has.

It‚Äôs almost like the media and the government are one. https://t.co/66wknAHJDC"
RepMTG,"What is happening at the DC Jail?????
@MayorBowser https://t.co/ahejXiuzvi"
RepMTG,"We‚Äôre currently voting on 20+ bills, Dems &amp; some Republicans are so upset they have to actually vote, after we (HFC members) have asked for recorded votes (so the American people can see our voting record), they‚Äôre threatening consequences to make us stop. 

Voting is our JOB."
RepMTG,The greatest choice a woman can make is becoming a mother. https://t.co/FqePbRHjey
RepMTG,"Since Biden took office he cancelled the Keystone Pipeline, released half of our strategic petroleum reserve, is canceling oil and gas leases, and is waging a proxy war with Russia with sanctions that line Putin‚Äôs pockets and empty ours.

Dems are blaming price gouging. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
RepMTG,"Since the Democrats are obsessed with investigating 1 riot, even though all the people involved have been arrested and charged and some are still rotting pretrial in jail, this is my new sign outside my office. https://t.co/0EhLPTgPau"
RepMTG,"I do live in that world.

I am blessed to live in Georgia. And I want the same for every law-abiding citizen.

I‚Äôm shocked at how many people refuse to take responsibility for defending themselves, handing over their rights and depending on the failing government to protect them. https://t.co/MANu86EuHa"
RepMTG,"Biden should secure our own border w/ American tax dollars instead of pursuing military engagement in foreign countries &amp; doing the bidding of the military industrial complex.

Approx 50 known terrorists were caught trying to enter since Biden took office, how many weren‚Äôt? https://t.co/G9OEqMzTtd"
RepMTG,"Now the Dems make you tweet their divisive and dangerous lies, all so you can raise money from Democrat donors as you try to cling to your seat.

And you actually comply.

How pathetic. https://t.co/QNKn1KdDrq"
RepMTG,"The Buffalo shooting is an awful tragedy, and the only person to blame is the young man that pulled the trigger.

It is wise for everyone to pay attention to the fact that he chose this location bc of NY‚Äôs strict gun control laws.

When people can‚Äôt carry, they are defenseless. https://t.co/hz4TPRE19I"
RepMTG,"Our family is praying for the victims &amp; families of the shootings this weekend and the severe mental health crisis in America.

Instead of investing billions in foreign countries, we should only be investing in our own people and our own problems."
RepMTG,"Biden is responsible for people dying in Ukraine by his America last energy policies.

Canceling the Keystone pipeline &amp; leases, &amp; giving US Oil &amp; Gas no confidence to invest in drilling, Biden has driven up the cost of oil &amp; helped Putin make massive profits to pay for his war."
RepMTG,"The steady flow of federal funds to defense manufacturers ‚Äúto keep them producing in case of war‚Äù would be unnecessary if our government‚Äôs policies were 100% America first.

Manufacturers should be able to diversify and retool to thrive in an American economy in times of peace."
RepMTG,I love being at home in beautiful Northwest Georgia. https://t.co/kYSG1r5hZJ
RepMTG,"@mattgaetz @RepThomasMassie I fixed it @mattgaetz.
We both know @RepThomasMassie was the OG #AmericaFirst. https://t.co/ueg2hFyxez"
RepMTG,"2. If the conditions in Ukraine were so grave to warrant the U.S. sending $54 billion, then our highest ranking leaders would not be able to go.

But conditions at our own U.S. border are out of control warranting billions of funding, however there is baby formula there."
RepMTG,"1. Notice U.S. elected politicians like @SpeakerPelosi üá∫üá¶ and @LeaderMcConnell üá∫üá¶ can go visit Zelensky üá∫üá¶ in Ukraine without bullet proof vests/helmets or any fear from dangers of war, while they eagerly give billions to fund their proxy war w/ Russia.

 https://t.co/ay2Az5DfJ9"
RepMTG,".@JoeBiden said he‚Äôs not a mind reader &amp; that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt do anything to help American parents desperately searching for baby formula.

Baby formula shortages started in July 2021, Joe.

And your admin was mindful enough to send pallets of formula to the border for illegals. https://t.co/NURB9sS3vt"
RepMTG,"Congress has not voted to go to war.

What is wrong with you, @LeaderHoyer? https://t.co/ZByPHSaFXR"
RepMTG,"Perhaps all the chest feeding men will step up and help out. 

Right @jrpsaki? https://t.co/8eV0zV7dc7"
RepMTG,"But but but.. Ukraine!

Just imagine if the government leaders (who hold power because they were elected by the People) actually legislated and voted to fix the things their voters truly care about.

Gee there‚Äôs a novel idea. https://t.co/OJj91BhHki"
RepMTG,".@AOC, what is the carbon footprint of the proxy war with Russia you voted to fund?"
RepMTG,"The @washingtonpost and the rest of the media are obsessed with another country while America faces crisis after crisis created by Joe Biden and the Democrats. 

Why don‚Äôt they care about the invasion at our border, skyrocketing inflation, and a shortage of baby formula? https://t.co/wYW8DPZ6az"
RepMTG,"Today, I introduced a resolution to honor the life and legacy of Corporal Christopher Dye.

A true hero from Northwest Georgia. https://t.co/4wxUSV8Gl4"
RepMTG,"Don‚Äôt worry Moms and Dads, while you are frantically searching for baby formula, Congress is busy naming Post Offices."
RepMTG,"Food security is national security.

The Biden administration is sending pallets of baby formula to the border for illegal aliens, while American mothers are crying in the grocery store searching for it.

We should Protect America First! https://t.co/jIieOqZ8Zs"
RepMTG,"Our nation honors the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to protect our communities during #NationalPoliceWeek.

This morning, I joined my colleagues to remember the officers who gave it all while serving us at the National Law Enforcement Memorial. https://t.co/Qt0XIcoyq0"
