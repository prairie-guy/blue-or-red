RepDonBeyer,Republicans are arguing that the government should force women to give birth - including in cases of rape - but it's government overreach to (1) stop a white supremacist planning a mass shooting from getting assault weapons or (2) criticize the racist ideology that inspires him.

RepDonBeyer,"Space situational awareness (""SSA"") is the ability to identify, understand, and predict the location of objects in space. It's very important, with ramifications that only grow as we and other spacefaring nations increase our operations. From our @HouseScience hearing last week: https://t.co/Xgf6b3XEtK"
RepDonBeyer,Glad to hear you're feeling better and best wishes for a fast recovery @ChrisVanHollen! https://t.co/DOoLHSpx1m
RepDonBeyer,"Horrified by the tragedy in Buffalo, and the lives lost today. This kind of mass shooting rarely happens in other countries but it’s getting more and more commonplace here. It’s simply unacceptable that so many politicians have decided this kind of carnage is ok. It’s not ok. https://t.co/TM5oVoPhNf"

RepDonBeyer,"Rand Paul just singlehandedly blocked urgently-needed defense aid for Ukraine, which will delay final passage until at least next week.

57 Republicans voted against this bipartisan legislation in the House and it still passed overwhelmingly. But Senate rules are... different. https://t.co/5cGJmWuwkG"
RepDonBeyer,"A subpoena should not have been necessary to compel Members of Congress to reveal what they know about a violent, seditious attack on the United States Capitol. It was their patriotic duty to cooperate, but they refused. https://t.co/stlUnNo1Qs"
