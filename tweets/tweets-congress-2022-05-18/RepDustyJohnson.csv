RepDustyJohnson,"The FDA doesn't need more funding, they need a plan. I voted no. There are alternative solutions: temporarily increase imports from other countries with safety standards just as high - if not higher - than our own. (2/2)"
RepDustyJohnson,"At the beginning of this week, I was told Speaker Pelosi was planning to bring a bill to the floor to purchase emergency formula for America's babies. Instead, the House just voted on a $28 million bill to give more funding to the FDA. (1/2)"
RepDustyJohnson,Students from @usd visited today and got to hear about what I‚Äôm working on in Congress for South Dakota and how they can intern in Washington. Maybe we will see one of them out here soon! #GoYotes https://t.co/BXjAQV6STy
RepDustyJohnson,"ABATE was on the Hill this week to talk about the importance of newer vehicle sensors that detect motorcyclists‚Äìnot just cars. This Motorcycle Safety Month, make sure to look, and look again! #MotorcycleSafety https://t.co/ZCrJLqB5bD"
RepDustyJohnson,"Congrats to Congressional Art Competition 1st place winner from Jefferson High School - Isabelle Hastings. Isabelle's ""Blushing"" will be displayed for one year in the U.S. Capitol! üé® https://t.co/4jzPwDQ8kr"
RepDustyJohnson,I want lower gas prices too. But we need a long term solution ‚Äì American energy security.
RepDustyJohnson,"Example: Last week, the Biden Admin canceled two large oil &amp; gas leases. https://t.co/AvXi0mUenj"
RepDustyJohnson,Don‚Äôt be fooled by this approach. It‚Äôs not about holding ‚Äúbig oil‚Äù accountable. It‚Äôs about distracting from the administration‚Äôs decision to stand in the way of American energy security. It‚Äôs about distracting from the trillions $ of unnecessary spending that‚Äôs fueled inflation.
RepDustyJohnson,Dems have blocked a bill to restart oil/gas leasing on Fed lands 5 times. This week ‚Äì the Speaker has a bill on the floor to prevent oil companies from raising prices. Instead of getting to the root issue ‚Äì lack of supply ‚Äì Dems are looking to government price controls.
RepDustyJohnson,Thank you to the men and women in law enforcement that put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities and the families that stand behind them. #NationalPoliceWeek üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/HWrfXjx9Pm

RepDustyJohnson,"The 129th MPAD was deployed for an overseas mission today. This is the first-ever South Dakota deployed unit to be led by two women. Good luck and Godspeed to Captain Muckey, First Sergeant Jensen, and their team. https://t.co/eIE64tbYcM"
RepDustyJohnson,FDA should‚Äôve developed a plan months ago. Why was there a 44-day delay on inspections of the Sturgis Abbott facility when the FDA knew there were consumer complaints about illness as far back as September 2021? @DrCaliff_FDA https://t.co/Uua5Mr7wcm
RepDustyJohnson,It‚Äôs chilling to see the damage done by last night‚Äôs storm in eastern South Dakota. Thank you to the first responders who run into the eye of the storm to help our communities. I‚Äôm praying for those affected.
