JacksonLeeTX18,"We must leave no stone unturned to ensure that we never have our families, mothers, fathers and their precious babies in this predicament ever again."
JacksonLeeTX18,"In addition, I cosponsored the legislation that¬† I promised that would allow WIC recipients to use their WIC cards for formula that is accessible even if it is not on their designated list."
JacksonLeeTX18,"Today, the President has enacted the Defense Production Act to ramp up domestic production of baby formula to get it on store shelves all over the nation."
JacksonLeeTX18,"Even after getting COVID, I remembered that I promised constituents that I met on last Saturday during the baby formula distribution that I would bring help as quickly as possible."

JacksonLeeTX18,His  body armor enabled him to kill 10 people including a retired police officer who confronted him and who did not have the body armor this violent white nationalist had. Enact H.R. 40 Now! Enact Gun Safety Legislation Now. Racism is real and America has to deal with it Now!
JacksonLeeTX18,The nation must cure the disease of gun violence and the ability of an 18-year-old to get not only weapons of war‚Ä¶
JacksonLeeTX18,The courageous act of taking action on H.R. 40 in the midst of this mass murder of African Americans in Buffalo will show the nation is standing up to racists and racism.
JacksonLeeTX18,"One of the major cures for America is enacting H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act, so that the nation can show it is not afraid to talk about race and what happened to African Americans starting from slavery."
JacksonLeeTX18,The hatred displayed in Buffalo is a manifestation of the ever-present undercurrent of violence directed at African Americans by those who hold extreme racist views. White Supremacists and White Nationalists are documented as posing the greatest domestic terrorism threat.
JacksonLeeTX18,"Racism is real, and racism can result in bloodshed and murder just like what happened in Buffalo. White Supremacists and White Nationalists have projected violence and death on African Americans for generations."

JacksonLeeTX18,"Pass H.R. 40, the Commission to Study Slavery and to Develop Reparation Proposals. This senseless killing has caused much pain for the Buffalo community and the families of those who lost their lives and were injured."
JacksonLeeTX18,"Sad note that the NRA is coming to Houston, TX near Discovery Green where families come and play.  There are too many guns on the street and we must recognize that the hatred in America has to be healed. More knowledge about the history of Black people can make a difference."
JacksonLeeTX18,"It is a sad commentary in America when a person not even older than 20 becomes heavily armed with guns and goes to a Black grocery store in Buffalo, NY and shoots 13 Black people and 10 people are dead. The hatred mixed with the toxicity of guns must stop!"
