RepPfluger,"Another HUGE smuggling tunnel with electricity and a railway was just found linking California and Mexico.

My @HomelandGOP bill to give DHS the resources to seal these tunnels passed the House last month. I'm calling on the Senate to immediately bring it up for a vote. https://t.co/V8POCtchiH"
RepPfluger,We know that the CCP is sending agents to infiltrate American university campuses and funnel our stolen IP back to the People's Liberation Army.

My thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones of those who were lost in such a reprehensible way."

RepPfluger,"As @SpeakerPelosi and House Democrats throw a hail mary attempt at saving their majority, the consensus on planet earth is that we need to encourage investment in our energy industry. Let's get serious and get back on the path of energy dominance. https://t.co/XgYreXFKU5"
RepPfluger,"My bill deters would-be attackers by making sure the administration responds adequately to any attack and protects the energy sector by codifying its designation as ""critical infrastructure.""

His war on American energy through ever-changing policies and uncertain regulations is only making it more difficult to produce energy here at home."
