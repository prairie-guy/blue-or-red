RepLawrence,Congress must work closely with @FTC and @SECGov as they ensure markets are competitive and fair for all Americans. Join me &amp; @AppropsDems now as we meet with administration officials to ensure they are doing just that: https://t.co/O89ydUiXe8
RepLawrence,"Grateful to speak at the @UAW CAP Conference this morning! When unions succeed, America succeeds. That's why I'm a strong champion of the PRO Act which strengthens workers’ power to form a union and negotiate for a bigger paycheck, better benefits and safer working conditions https://t.co/x0oeScTcpb"
RepLawrence,"Reliable, affordable and high-speed internet is a necessity. Today, I hosted a digital equity roundtable with Chair @JRosenworcelFCC, @LtGovGilchrist, @RepRashida, @JoshEdmonds216, and community and school leaders. Together, we're working to close the #digitaldivide for good. https://t.co/tGD1NzvaqR"
RepLawrence,"White supremacy is a threat to our country. Gun violence is a threat to our country. And we’re seeing communities in Buffalo and across the country being torn apart by both. Congress needs to address this senseless, hate-filled violence. Enough is enough."
RepLawrence,"Angry &amp; devastated at the racially-motivated terrorist attack in Buffalo last night. My heart goes out to the families who lost a loved one &amp; to a community stricken with grief. 

Make no mistake: this was an attack on the Black community. We need to call out this hate directly."
RepLawrence,"Taking a second to share a proud grandma moment. Last week, my amazing granddaughter became the newest grad from @michiganstateu. Go Green! Go White! I know she's going to continue to do incredible things in the future. https://t.co/ka8sePNMiV"
