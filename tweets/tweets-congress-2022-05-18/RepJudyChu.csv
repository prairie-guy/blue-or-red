RepJudyChu,"""Everybody has their own story, and it’s about what you want your life to be like and what you can handle.""

Proud of my colleague @RepGwenMoore for sharing her story. 1 in 4 American women has had an abortion, a right we must keep fighting to protect in every state and zip code. https://t.co/UEPt9NG7nE"
RepJudyChu,"Today, I’m keeping the families of loved ones taken too soon in my thoughts as we recognize and remember the one million American lives lost to COVID-19—over 90,000 Californians.

RepJudyChu,"Disgusted. Appalled. Heartbroken. 

This is how I felt reading Justice Alito's leaked draft opinion. 

Then I thought of the millions of Americans who would be impacted by this extreme decision—how desperate &amp; scared they must feel.

We won't let this happen. We will #ProtectRoe. https://t.co/IiC9YMxMwE"
RepJudyChu,"As @CAPAC Chair, I was proud to advocate for the Asian American community at the first conference meeting of the Bipartisan Innovation Act. I'm encouraging my colleagues to resolve differences to increase American competitiveness without stoking the flames of anti-Asian hate. https://t.co/9Ns7xR1yTf"
RepJudyChu,"Paid leave is *popular* and paid leave is *possible. *
 
In California, we've shown just how transformative paid family leave policies are. The time is now to enact a federal policy so workers in every corner of our nation are empowered to care and provide for their families. https://t.co/SaftxkKnfd"
