RepMarkGreen,"April was the worst month on record with 234,088 encounters at the southern border. And in 6 days, President Biden will lift #Title42 and border patrol will be even worse off than they already are."
RepMarkGreen,"Two different DNAs. 

Two different blood supplies. 

Two people. 

I’m for life. https://t.co/hoTKgYdy9C"
RepMarkGreen,"The dystopian “Disinformation” Governance Board had no place being created in the first place. 

This “pause” should be forever."
RepMarkGreen,Why won’t Democrat leadership let my amendment preventing federal investigations into peaceful parents for speaking out against school curriculum come up for a vote? https://t.co/Zmu1CoeKCM
RepMarkGreen,I will always #BackTheBlue. https://t.co/x7iCB5ALhz
RepMarkGreen,No one believes the Biden Administration will enforce any law at the border. Resign. https://t.co/QSMicw3TG9
RepMarkGreen,"My amendment would have protected parents’ ability to speak up and question harmful curriculum like Critical Race Theory and obscene reading materials in their child’s school while ensuring parents don’t become the federal government’s next target—again.

RepMarkGreen,"It’s truly unbelievable that Democrat leadership couldn’t bring themselves to protect parents from senseless investigations into their First Amendment activities.

RepMarkGreen,My remarks in today's @HouseForeignGOP hearing: https://t.co/j5gNOYca9u
RepMarkGreen,"President Biden knows how bad the situation at the border is, yet still plans to lift Title 42 this month. He just doesn’t care. https://t.co/iJ3GLkHiuN"
RepMarkGreen,"Ignoring problems doesn’t make them go away. 

First, the Biden Administration dismissed inflation as “transitory,” then falsely claimed it was a “global trend,” then said it “peaked” in December. 

Own it, fix it."
RepMarkGreen,"Our farmers are hurting because diesel prices are surging. 

Time to get it together and unleash American energy independence. ⛽️🇺🇸"

RepMarkGreen,"Rather than supporting pleas for freedom, the Biden White House is rewarding the Western Hemisphere’s longest-ruling communist dictatorship. This repeated appeasement to the Cuban dictatorship is a betrayal of America’s commitment to human rights. #SOSCuba https://t.co/t1SK19mXGu"
RepMarkGreen,"The Biden White House still doesn’t have a “timeline” for when baby formula will be back on shelves and waited too long to address the problem. 

Maybe if President Biden hadn’t waited over a year to appoint a leader at the FDA this tragedy wouldn’t have gotten so bad."
RepMarkGreen,"Thanks for having me on! 

🎙️Listen: https://t.co/tYlGFi2Bim"

RepMarkGreen,"Everyone is struggling with #Bidenflation:

RepMarkGreen,"Rather than addressing the glaring problems at the border, @SecMayorkas has busied himself with this new “disinformation” board as an apparent top priority for national security. If that isn’t tone deaf, what is? Resign! https://t.co/B0cKTzVRie"
