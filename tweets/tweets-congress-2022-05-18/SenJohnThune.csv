SenJohnThune,There can never be too many partners in the quest to preserve peace &amp; maintain a strong defense against tyranny. We should welcome any nation that seeks to help further these goals. Sweden &amp; Finland will offer valuable geopolitical &amp; strategic contributions to the #NATO alliance.
SenJohnThune,"An impressive group of students from @USD stopped by my Capitol office today with their professor, @Tom_Mroz. They had great questions about my work as South Dakota’s senator. https://t.co/mvpkX8Vaou"
SenJohnThune,"The border crisis clearly began when President Biden took office. If he ends Title 42 policies next week, we’re going to need a much taller chart. https://t.co/Idg5wBDReP"
SenJohnThune,"Always interested in hearing about the issues the @SiouxlndChamber is tracking, and it was great to see so many familiar faces at the Capitol today. I was glad to discuss my efforts to support our region’s economy https://t.co/fNjX1p7uvI"
SenJohnThune,"It’s #NationalPoliceWeek – a time set aside to honor the service of our nation’s law enforcement officers. Every day, these men &amp; women put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe and secure. Thank you. https://t.co/7asXkWfNFh"
SenJohnThune,"Why would the president oppose American energy solutions that would lower gas prices and increase our energy security? Because the president is blindly pursuing an ideological agenda that is out of step with the American people, and he doesn’t care about the pain it causes them. https://t.co/yAVwLQUHm5"
SenJohnThune,"Record-high
      gas prices
                   ↘
                       ↘
                Biden's record-low
                   approval ratings

Americans are feeling the pain at the pump, and they know who is to blame."
SenJohnThune,"You can agree or disagree with Biden and his admin on policies &amp; ideology – and there's plenty to disagree with – but on a basic level, this is an admin that doesn't do things well: inflation, Afghanistan, the border, supply chain – it's failure after failure. https://t.co/0d8uy7cR8m"
SenJohnThune,"The Biden admin should’ve seen a baby formula shortage coming when the FDA shut down one of the top producers of baby formula. In typical Biden admin fashion, they want to blame someone else for their inability to act when they should’ve moved immediately to increase imports."
SenJohnThune,Toured damage in Castlewood from the devastating storms this week. Inspiring to see the community come together to support South Dakotans who had their homes and properties damaged. https://t.co/BKj6tS2aNe
SenJohnThune,Heartbreaking to see the destruction and harm caused by the severe storms in eastern South Dakota last night. Kimberley and I are praying for everyone affected. Thank you to the first responders and power crews who are on the scene assisting these communities.
SenJohnThune,"Biden admin blames oil and gas companies for not doing enough to produce.
Also the Biden admin: https://t.co/8uLgNknmMP"
