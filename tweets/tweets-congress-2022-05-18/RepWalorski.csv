RepWalorski,Relieved to hear reports that the Biden Admin is giving up on its Disinformation Governance Board after we sounded the alarm. I helped introduce legislation that would prevent any taxpayer support for this or similar efforts that would endanger Americans' First Amendment rights.
RepWalorski,"Every day, I am hearing from Hoosier moms who are struggling to find the formula her child needs. I will continue calling on President Biden and his team to get serious about overcoming obstacles that prevent formula from reaching parents. 

The Biden Blame Game is unacceptable."
RepWalorski,"Grateful to partner with former First Lady @MELANIATRUMP to serve American foster kids and families. In case you missed it, read our column on Fostering a Brighter Future here: https://t.co/Qy0qOWItAW https://t.co/U4HcxbjkmX"
RepWalorski,"As Hoosiers face record-high prices at the pump, it is unbelievable that President Biden is canceling oil and gas leases. We need MORE American-made energy - not less. 

This is Biden's War on Energy. https://t.co/w8rQzJHFei"
RepWalorski,Great to meet this week with South Bend Councilman Henry Davis Jr. and other community members at Beck's Lake about protecting our community and the wellbeing of Hoosiers. https://t.co/y9j3rhjkPp
RepWalorski,"At a local grocery store last weekend, a 4lb chicken cost a whopping $21. Skyrocketing #inflation is a disaster for every Hoosier family - and especially for our seniors. 

We must end big-government intervention, prioritize American-made energy, and get ports working overtime."
RepWalorski,"The persistent formula shortage is a terrifying crisis for families across America. I'm calling on President Biden and the FDA to take immediate action to jump start production and get formula into the hands of parents. 

This is a matter of life and death. https://t.co/iks1gHYLBh"
