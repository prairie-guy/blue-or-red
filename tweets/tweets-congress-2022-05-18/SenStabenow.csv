SenStabenow,That’s why I’m leading this bipartisan effort with @JohnBoozman and Senate and House colleagues to address this shortage as quickly as possible. We must do everything we can to ensure our families have what they need to keep their children healthy and fed.https://t.co/2TFMNabxls
SenStabenow,"This is an extremely stressful time for parents who are being forced to search high and low to find baby formula. 

Almost half of all babies born in the U.S. rely on the WIC program."
SenStabenow,"Thank you, @POTUS.

SenStabenow,.@johnboozman and I are partnering across the aisle to help millions of families get the formula they need to feed their babies during this crisis. WATCH: https://t.co/fVM60aQBeg
SenStabenow,"It’s been six months since we passed the historic Infrastructure law. Since then, Michigan has received over $2.9 billion to fix our roads and bridges, strengthen public transportation, clean up our Great Lakes, and more. And we are just getting started!"
SenStabenow,Oil and gas companies are making prices at the pump go up and up so that they can continue to make record-high profits. These companies are exploiting hardworking Michiganders.
SenStabenow,It's always great to celebrate women business leaders - especially when they are from Michigan! So glad I got to talk with @committeeof200 members and thank them for all they do. https://t.co/M9DqD7wWRB
SenStabenow,"No parent should have to frantically run from one grocery store to the next or go online to try to find food for their baby.
 
I am laser-focused on making sure moms and babies can get the healthy food they need safely. This crisis is urgent! https://t.co/qmzzJlNk5d"
SenStabenow,Reminder: Republicans have increased our national deficit. Democrats are lowering it. https://t.co/iibtwWyM31
SenStabenow,"Good news!

SenStabenow,"The 25 largest oil and gas companies raked in $205 billion in profits last year all while price gouging Michigan drivers at the pump. This has got to stop.
https://t.co/7V0YUz95c3"
SenStabenow,"This action by the FDA is important. Safely increasing the availability of infant formula from trusted international companies will give parents more options for their babies that meet our critical nutrition and safety standards.

SenStabenow,"Today marks the 68th anniversary of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling ending racial segregation in public schools. This decision forever changed our country, but the fight for racial justice is not over."
SenStabenow,"This is absurd!
 
Oil and gas companies are making choices to keep prices high at the pump so that they can pad their pockets with record profits.

SenStabenow,Then we must act to address gun violence! It’s past time!
SenStabenow,"My heart goes out to the families in Buffalo who lost a loved one over the weekend.
 
The facts are clear: this was a planned white supremacist attack on a Black community. White supremacy, hatred, and racism have no place in our country and must be condemned."
SenStabenow,Sending well wishes to my friend @ChrisVanHollen and his family. I look forward to seeing him back in the Senate soon. https://t.co/CfMy7R9n1L
SenStabenow,@POTUS and @SenateDems budget will lower costs that keep Americans up at night. The Republican plan? Increase taxes on Americans and let billionaires and large companies off the hook as they price gouge and take advantage of the American people.
SenStabenow,"This Gold Star Awareness Month, we honor all of Michigan’s Gold Star families. No one has given more to our country than service members lost in combat and the families they leave behind.

SenStabenow,Alvaro Bedoya is confirmed! This means the @FTC now has the full strength to put consumers first by protecting them from price-gouging.
SenStabenow,"Our Asian Pacific American businesses make our communities stronger and more vibrant in Michigan.

SenStabenow,"Dr. Lisa Cook’s experience is unmatched and is needed as our nation recovers from the pandemic. I’m so proud to see one of Michigan’s best at the Federal Reserve — I know she’ll do an amazing job.
