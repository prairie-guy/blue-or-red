RepBobGibbs,"Today is #InternationalMuseumDay, and I’m featuring @massmu. This video was taken in 2016, and it highlights the value the museum has provided to the community over the last 50 years. There is a wealth of knowledge Ohioans can gain from access to this cultural hub! https://t.co/9dm6Db5fM2"
RepBobGibbs,".@POTUS and his administration are either incompetent or they are being purposely negligent. Either way, this is outrageous. https://t.co/N5j18cKnhX"
RepBobGibbs,Democrats’ soft-on-crime and “defund the police” policies have resulted in more police officers being killed in the line of duty during @POTUS’s first year than any other year since 1995. We need to support the brave men and women in blue who put their lives at risk every day. https://t.co/CsK9NCivEs
RepBobGibbs,"40% of our nation’s baby formula is out of stock. The Biden administration's lack of urgency to address this crisis, which has been worsening for months, is unacceptable. This is a matter of life and death for many families. https://t.co/zC9GiV19Os"
RepBobGibbs,"Global crude oil supply is a huge factor in gas prices, and Biden’s domestic energy policies are reducing global supply and driving up prices for Americans, many who can’t afford it. https://t.co/DSGr17QBzU"
RepBobGibbs,"It’s obvious this is on purpose. Inflation is raging and everyone is paying more for everything while wages aren’t increasing with prices. Biden is taking “never let a crisis go to waste” to heart, and Americans are paying the price for his radical progressive agenda. https://t.co/QqwYpCeRhY"
