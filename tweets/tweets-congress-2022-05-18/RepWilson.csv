RepWilson,The @MiamiHEAT are off to a strong start in the Eastern Conference Finals ‚Äì making us proud. Let‚Äôs go Heat! üî• https://t.co/dhfz6qEWq3
RepWilson,"I am proud to vote in support of the reauthorization of #WRDA2022. This bipartisan investment in our ports, waterways, and environment will build more resilient communities, strengthen local economies, and protect the lives and livelihoods of our residents."
RepWilson,"As the Chair of the #PortsCaucus, I've worked tirelessly to advocate for restoring the two-year #WRDA2022 reauthorization and supporting projects at ports across Florida, including @PortEverglades, @PortMiami, @PortCanaveral, and @JAXPORT."
RepWilson,"Thank you Chair @gracenapolitano and @RepPeterDeFazio, as well as Ranking Members @RepSamGraves and @RepDavidRouzer for your leadership and commitment to helping states, territories, and Tribes affordably invest in their water infrastructure."
RepWilson,"#WRDA2022 also includes efforts to help coastal communities nationwide. I'm happy to announce investments in:
üèñÔ∏èCoastal flooding mitigation
üå™Ô∏èFeasibility study for reducing the risk of hurricane and storm damage in Miami-Dade
üêäEverglades restoration &amp;
ü¶†Algal bloom research"

üö∞$184M to address @MiamiDadeCounty septic and sewer crisis
üö¢$330M in navigation improvements for @PortEverglades to strengthen our supply chain"
RepWilson,"Today, I joined @TransportDems to markup #WRDA2022, which helps communities throughout South Florida invest in their water resources infrastructure in anticipation of future needs‚Äîespecially as climate change worsens. Together, we can save lives and resources.üßµ https://t.co/OQ9SeaEJLd"
RepWilson,"Families in South Florida are feeling the pain and stress of the infant formula shortage firsthand.
¬†
Today, I am voting with @HouseDemocrats to get the FDA the resources it needs to address this shortage &amp; help prevent it from ever happening again. #FeedOurInfants https://t.co/YX1D7H4tVn"
RepWilson,"I am proud to represent one of the largest Haitian-American communities in the country. Now, more than ever, Haiti needs our support and guidance to get through these difficult times and emerge a more democratic, prosperous, and unified country."
RepWilson,The Haitian Flag was born out of an act of defiance ‚Äì sown from pieces of a French flag as a symbol of independence. Today we commemorate #HaitianFlagDay by bringing our community together in celebration of this unifying symbol of the Haitian people‚Äôs independent spirit. https://t.co/l2R22hwo2E
RepWilson,"I've seen with my own eyes how poweful it can be to give our children a head start on their education. As a former Head Start educator and coordinator for @MDCPS, I will fight to keep and expand this program every chance I get."
RepWilson,"Project @NatlHeadStart ‚Äî launched 57 years ago today ‚Äî was created to address educational inequity and ensure every child has a chance to succeed.

Since then, it‚Äôs helped 39+ million children and reduced the burden on working mothers and families nationwide. #HappyBDayHeadStart https://t.co/euC1IzuUqb"
RepWilson,"Last year, I led 3 hearings on the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act‚Äôs youth programs and their impact on our nation‚Äôs workforce. I‚Äôm proud to vote today to be #InvestinginWorkers and provide Americans with jobs, education, training, and the support they need to succeed. https://t.co/rFVgbyKomJ"
RepWilson,"I will always stand up against hate in every form. International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia is a day for us to stand as allies to those in the LGBTQ+ community. You are loved, you are accepted, and you will always have a home in District 24. #IDAHOBIT"
RepWilson,"Republicans nationwide are attempting to vilify Jewish, Black, and immigrant communities for political gain. As we saw this weekend, their partisan politics come at a cost ‚Äî the lives of our brothers, daughters, grandmothers, and fathers. 

This radicalization must be stopped. https://t.co/0j3mzdsywq"
RepWilson,"Addressing racial disparities in education also means improving the diversity of our teachers. 

I proudly co-sponsored the Strength in Diversity Act and made sure it included funds to recruit and hire teachers who reflect the communities they teach."
RepWilson,"In 1954, the Supreme Court held that segregated schools are inherently unconstitutional. I grew up in those schools &amp; know first-hand how they limit opportunity.

Today we celebrate the landmark #BrownVBoard decision but note that we‚Äôre far from achieving real educational equity. https://t.co/kiinL2mjag"
RepWilson,"Scholarship Opportunity üö®

@305CAHSD is offering $1,500 scholarships to current or enrolling college students living in Miami-Dade County who live within 200% of the federal poverty line and who have maintained a 2.0 GPA.

RepWilson,It was a pleasure to join @Legacy_Miami in honoring South Florida‚Äôs 2022 most powerful and influential Black business leaders at the 16th Annual Power Gala. These change-makers‚Äô contributions to our communities and businesses continue to make us proud. https://t.co/QVG2b6Foo8
RepWilson,"This November, we must vote to root out this hypocrisy. We must vote for politicians who will respect the rights of our sisters, nieces, mothers, grandmothers, family, and partners. The ballot box holds the key locally, in our states, and in Congress."
RepWilson,"If our country will deny individuals the ability to make choices about their bodies, we must give them the tools to take care of those children. That‚Äôs how we protect children‚Äôs lives ‚Äî not by limiting people‚Äôs access to healthcare."
RepWilson,Where are conservatives when grandmothers are struggling to buy diapers and formula? The only time I see them is on the floor of the House trying to take away grandma‚Äôs Social Security and attacking her Medicare and food stamps.
RepWilson,Floridians have seen their access to abortions hindered by laws like the 15-week abortion ban ‚Äî the same state that mandates lessons against communism while taking a page from the authoritarian playbook and instituting communist-like controls over a person‚Äôs reproductive organs.
RepWilson,"Imagine a 13-year-old raped and forced to give birth...
the pain of someone gang-raped and forced to carry to term...
a woman with seven children, threatened with domestic violence if she gets pregnant again...
We cannot and will not go back to the days of back-alley abortions."
RepWilson,"Losing access to reproductive health counseling will be devastating, increasing the health risks facing women around the country. The U.S. stands out among developed nations for its shockingly high maternal mortality rate, lack of paid maternity leave &amp; limited childcare access."
RepWilson,"For many lower-income people, limiting reproductive healthcare options succeeds only at regulating who can and cannot have an abortion. Because those with the financial resources will still have access to safe abortions, creating a separate and unequal healthcare system."
RepWilson,"I‚Äôm sick and tired of hearing Republicans say one thing and do another. If they truly cared about the lives of our children, they would join me in expanding assistance to kids and families and not limit their rights.

RepWilson,"For parents with questions about what to do if they cannot obtain infant formula, @HHSGov has launched a new webpage that provides resources and information on where formula can be found.
Visit ‚û°Ô∏èhttps://t.co/aHLmzhWc33"
RepWilson,"Families depend on baby formula to feed their youngest ones but ongoing supply chain problems have caused shortages, leaving parents in desperate need. 

As a senior member of the @EdLaborCmte we are urgently working to address these disruptions &amp; get formula back on the shelves!"
RepWilson,"It was a pleasure to join local leaders and young men from @5000RoleModels to present @SuptDotres with a Congressional record honoring his work and achievements. Under his leadership, I am confident that the future of @MDCPS and our students will be bright. https://t.co/w1oOY09jJu"

I am proud to call Miami Gardens my home. https://t.co/g0N74dxvAp"
RepWilson,"Our nation bears a heavy burden. One million Americans ‚Äî almost 3,000 in District 24 ‚Äî have been lost to #COVID19.

Even as hospitalizations are lower, our battle against this virus wages on. Do your part, get your vaccine. https://t.co/b9jIicj8KF"
RepWilson,Frontline TSA workers who help keep our skies safe from possible attacks and through the #COVID19 pandemic deserve workplace protections and fair wages. I'm proud to support @BennieGThompson's #RightsForTheTSAWorkforce Act and address the challenges facing the agency and workers. https://t.co/gS3hM1pOET
