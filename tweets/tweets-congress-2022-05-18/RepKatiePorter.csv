RepKatiePorter,"Too many communities, including ours in Orange County, know the pain of gun violence. It's unacceptable that online gun marketplaces can freely sell weapons to criminals. Today, @RepJasonCrow and I introduced a bill to close the loophole that lets retailers escape accountability."
RepKatiePorter,"Quid pro quo is the clearest form of corruption there is. Officials shouldn't be let off the hook just because they've left office.

RepKatiePorter,"U.S. Fish and Wildlife refused to allow construction near an endangered river—until the Trump Administration intervened following $241,600 in campaign donations from a developer and his friends.

RepKatiePorter,"Dr. John Cheng undoubtedly saved lives when he charged a shooter at his mother's church this past Sunday. Today, I joined my Orange County colleagues for a moment of silence on the House floor to honor Dr. Cheng's life, legacy, and sacrifice. https://t.co/4amqEeFt9G"
RepKatiePorter,"Our country is confronting an opioid epidemic, a gun violence epidemic, and a humanitarian crisis at our southern border—all at the same time.

RepKatiePorter,"A shooting at a church in Laguna Woods has left multiple people injured. This is upsetting and disturbing news, especially less than a day after a mass shooting in Buffalo. This should not be our new normal. I will work hard to support the victims and their families."
RepKatiePorter,"Scams against older Americans—especially those involving Medicare—are rising, so I'm urging leadership to bolster the Senior Medicare Patrol program.

RepKatiePorter,"Corporations and the ultra-wealthy are not paying their fair share in taxes, and that's forcing the rest of us to pick up the tab. My colleagues and I are urging House leadership to give the IRS the resources it needs to enforce existing law and crack down on wealthy tax cheats. https://t.co/amyoXQYxGd"
RepKatiePorter,The ultra-wealthy can cheat our tax code because lobbyists successfully pushed to strip the IRS of the resources it needs to compete with big wig lawyers and accountants. We need to stand up to special interests and fund the IRS—an investment that'll return $5 for every $1 spent. https://t.co/gBrGJQTNlq
