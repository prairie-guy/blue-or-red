RepMullin,"Today, I had the distinct honor of welcoming the Northeast Oklahoma Veterans Freedom Tour to Washington, D.C. Our veterans put their lives on the line to defend our freedoms, and it's only right they have the chance to visit the memorials and monuments dedicated to their service. https://t.co/US2nvdma9M"
RepMullin,This is great news for free speech and our Constitution. https://t.co/PjeYE91Hhi

RepMullin,"Democrats used the second impeachment resolution to once again weaponize one of the most grave and consequential powers of the House. My resolution shows that this was never about the Constitution; it was pure politics and power.

RepMullin,"üö®üö®üö® 234,088 illegal migrants were encountered at the southern border in April. 

This is the HIGHEST number of monthly encounters on record. The Biden Administration has 6 days to stop the repeal of Title 42 before this crisis worsens."
RepMullin,"Exciting news! 

Yesterday, @CoxComm announced plans to expand its high-speed internet, TV, and automation services into Tahlequah later this year. 

I'm thrilled to hear about this investment and look forward to the increased connectivity it will bring to Oklahoma."
RepMullin,"Gas prices have a reached another record high today.

President Biden‚Äôs response? Turn to Venezuela for oil. It seems his administration would rather depend on foreign dictators than our domestic producers for supply."
RepMullin,"Hard-working Americans don‚Äôt need the latest Consumer Price Index to confirm what they have been experiencing for months: pain.

RepMullin,God bless our law enforcement officers. Today we remember those we have lost in the line of duty and the loved ones they left behind. https://t.co/FclRptpvBX
RepMullin,"Another week of crises was met by another week of inaction from the Biden Admin. While they blame mothers for hoarding formula, the CEO of Abbott Nutrition can‚Äôt even get a call back from Biden's FDA.

I can't begin to understand the admin's reasoning here. #WeeklyWrapUp https://t.co/CTR6V0MvVy"
RepMullin,Did President Biden's Ministry of Truth not fact check this one? https://t.co/pi0f4CjGDK
RepMullin,"The DOJ must immediately tell the public how they plan to handle this violation to ensure the continued safety and security of our Supreme Court justices and help restore faith in our constitutional process.

I'm glad to join this letter. https://t.co/kvgsGI8u8E"
RepMullin,"Actions speak louder than words, @POTUS. 

Cancelling three offshore oil &amp; gas leases off the coast of Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico ends any chance that an offshore lease sale will be held this year.

This will do nothing but EXACERBATE prices at the pump."
RepMullin,"The same party and administration that wanted to convince the public that Republicans undermined the rule of law are now openly intimidating the third branch of government or supporting the efforts of those who do.

Congress cannot stand by and let this happen. https://t.co/NXCymH3YIJ"
RepMullin,"Our law enforcement officers deserve our full support, but it's not enough to just say that. 

The Invest to Protect Act will make critical, targeted investments in local PDs and ensure police officers have the training they need to keep their cities safe. #NationalPoliceWeek https://t.co/UyD4Zb48Xh"
RepMullin,I am proud to join my @HouseCommerce and @HouseGOP colleagues in sending this letter. The lack of urgency we have seen from the Biden Administration is unacceptable. They must address this shortage immediately. https://t.co/fcBAaSxkbP
