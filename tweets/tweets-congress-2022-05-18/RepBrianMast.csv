RepBrianMast,üö® DHS temporarily ‚Äúpaused‚Äù the work of the ‚ÄúDisinformation Governance Board‚Äù aka the Ministry of Truth. This should only exist in a dystopian novel or maybe a history book about the USSR. I‚Äôll keep the fight going in Congress until this ‚Äúboard‚Äù is permanently scrapped.

RepBrianMast,"If Democrats in Congress hadn‚Äôt pushed through a $1.9 trillion wishlist in 2021, inflation would not be at the levels it is now and our dollars would go further at the grocery store.
