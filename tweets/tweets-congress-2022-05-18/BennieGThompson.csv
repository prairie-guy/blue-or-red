BennieGThompson,Going to the grocery store &amp; seeing empty shelves with no infant formula in sight is distressing for any parent. @HouseDemocrats &amp; I are voting for a bill that will help #FeedOurInfants by providing the FDA with the resources it needs to address this shortage.

BennieGThompson,"It's time to support TSA's frontline workers who keep our skies secure - but lack the rights of other Feds. The #RightsForTheTSAWorkforce Act will provide its 60k workers:
âœ…25%+ increase in pay under Title 5
âœ…Full collective bargaining rights
âœ…Independent appeal resolution"
BennieGThompson,"Today the House will pass the bipartisan Rights for the TSA Workforce Act to give the frontline workers who keep our skies secure the same basic rights and protections afforded to other Federal workers under Title 5, including better pay and full collective bargaining rights."
