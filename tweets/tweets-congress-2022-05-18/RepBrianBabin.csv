RepBrianBabin,"Proud to work with my colleagues to ensure the Water Resources and Development Act of 2022 meets the  needs of our country.

Congress must make sure our ports are updated, communities protected, and federal projects completed.
 
A robust infrastructure = a strong America. https://t.co/lqTMZytU2Y"
RepBrianBabin,"A few things:
 
1. Congress must hold #BigTech accountable for censoring free speech.
2. Liberal outlets politicizing the tragedy in Buffalo should be ashamed of themselves.
3. America needs Title 42.

Discussed all three topics on @newsmax - watch below ⤵️ https://t.co/1fOHJ0uIbZ"
RepBrianBabin,Privileged to sit down with Representative @bikhim today to discuss the importance of a robust U.S.-Taiwan alliance and the steps Congress should take to keep it that way! https://t.co/47h0o0kyF0
RepBrianBabin,"234,088 illegals were apprehended in April - an all-time high.

117, 989 of those illegals were released into the U.S.

@SecMayorkas: Tell me again how the #bordercrisis has been ""effectively managed.""

DO YOUR JOB OR RESIGN! https://t.co/Gy5m1k2x9S"
RepBrianBabin,"Up, up, and away goes the price of gas.

With record-breaking highs, you'd think Biden would push for real solutions to lower fuel costs... like unleashing domestic energy producers.

But no. He’d rather play politics.

RepBrianBabin,"The @WHO is in Communist China's pocket, yet Biden wants to send them OUR private health information.

The same country responsible for the COVID pandemic. The same organization Trump tried to pull us out of.

@POTUS: Focus on AMERICA’s healthcare &amp; stop bowing to China's puppet."
RepBrianBabin,"Inflation jumped 8.3% over the past 12 months - the biggest single-year increase since 1984.

Biden's self-made inflation crisis will cost the average American household more than $5,000 this year.

RepBrianBabin,"If Title 42 is rescinded, our southern border will disappear. 

The #BidenBorderCrisis is one of the greatest threats we face. https://t.co/BW9aphq7yq"
RepBrianBabin,"It’s clear: The Democrats celebrate lawlessness.
 
They're out of touch with the American people.
 
I proudly joined my GOP colleagues in thanking law enforcement for the work they do to keep us safe.

RepBrianBabin,"I had a fantastic meeting with Yossi Dagan, Israeli Mayor of the Samaria Region, earlier this week.

Israel is our strongest Middle Eastern ally. Maintaining and strengthening that alliance is critical to achieving peace within the region.

America must always stand with Israel! https://t.co/Cl3hednMXu"
RepBrianBabin,"While I'm deeply supportive of the Ukrainian people, I could not blindly vote to send $40 billion more of your tax dollars overseas.

Our treasury isn't limitless, and we have historic and increasingly dangerous crises being ignored.

Joined @RealAmVoice to discuss this more ⤵️ https://t.co/RA8Tgr9p7n"
RepBrianBabin,"When you can’t find baby formula on the shelves, just remember, Biden's sending it to the southern border for illegal aliens.

This is peak America-last agenda.

RepBrianBabin,"Yesterday morning, I laid a wreath in honor of our fallen police officers.

Some of America’s finest were in attendance as we gave thanks for the sacrifices made by our brave men and women in blue! #backtheblue #nationalpoliceweek2022 https://t.co/sD6vOsRInc"
RepBrianBabin,"Proud to support @RepMikeJohnson's bill to ensure AG Garland enforces our laws and protects the integrity of our nation's highest court!

RepBrianBabin,"Modern science shows that at 15 weeks, an unborn baby can feel pain. Yet, the ""Party of Science"" doesn't care.

The Dems have embraced an anti-life agenda so radical that they now support infanticide.

The #SCOTUS ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson will determine the futures of millions. https://t.co/1rBUeNcNqi"
RepBrianBabin,"We're a nation of laws, and it’s time AG Garland starts enforcing them.
 
Attempting to intimidate and influence SCOTUS Justices by protesting outside of their private homes is illegal. 

These radical activists must be held accountable for their actions! https://t.co/zQavNCvM7o"
