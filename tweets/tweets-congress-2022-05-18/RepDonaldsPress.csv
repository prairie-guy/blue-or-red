RepDonaldsPress,".@PressSec is correct. A war is to blame for the increased gas prices. Biden's war on America's energy industry. 

Stop with the ""Putin's Price Hike"" talking points. No one believes you.

RepDonaldsPress,"ICYMI: Today in @HSBCgop, I had the opportunity to question Patrick Kelley of the @SBAgov.

RepDonaldsPress,"Nina Jankowicz must have gotten tired of flagging her boss's tweets as disinformation. 

Goodbye, Ministry of Truth. Hello, Freedom! 

Republicans will continue to fight for freedom and stand up to the Biden administration's Orwellian tactics. 

This is America, not North Korea. https://t.co/G01gQCtkCO"
RepDonaldsPress,"The failure of Joe Biden's radical agenda is showcasing the dysfunction of governing with talking points and not strategic policy.

Biden's inability to implement sound economic policy is inflicting severe financial harm to millions of families across the U.S.

RepDonaldsPress,"Joe Biden and Democrats are politicizing the evilness that occurred in Buffalo this past weekend to spin this tragedy and fearmonger the American public to push their radical agenda and stay in power.

It's atrocious and distasteful to the families who lost a loved one. https://t.co/6WkahcuaW9"
RepDonaldsPress,"Today is a special day in my office, my Legislative Director, Alex is celebrating a birthday! Alex is an integral part of our team and a devoted public servant to Florida‚Äôs 19th Congressional District.

RepDonaldsPress,"The WHO is an arm of the CCP and should have zero say over any policy related to our nation. The response by the WHO amid the pandemic made it clear that they are a sham organization that prioritizes the needs of our adversaries, not the American people.‚¨áÔ∏è

RepDonaldsPress,"Nurses play a vital role in our communities and @GovRonDeSantis‚Äô unparalleled $125 million investment in training the next generation of Florida‚Äôs nurses will be instrumental in advancing our state‚Äôs healthcare industry and workforce.

RepDonaldsPress,"üö®We Are One Week Away From Title 42 Expiringüö®

Since taking office, President Biden handed over our border and national security to radical ACLU progressives putting our nation, its people, and our sovereignty in grave danger.

This week, and every week, I am eternally grateful for the selfless service of our LEOs.

We must always #BackTheBlue. https://t.co/fcjVBayYcl"
RepDonaldsPress,"The deliberate neglect of our southern border is not just a national security crisis but a constitutional crisis. The president has the constitutional obligation to protect and defend the United States, and his policies are purposefully endangering our security. https://t.co/rFONmL0aBQ"
RepDonaldsPress,Erika &amp; I join the nation in mourning the innocent victims of the horrific &amp; hate-filled attack in Buffalo. The heinous actions of this deranged murderer speak to the very worst of humanity which has no place in America. Let‚Äôs never forget those we lost.

RepDonaldsPress,"ICYMI: I joined @IngrahamAngle last night to discuss how the Biden administration‚Äôs inability to implement sound policy has led to continued failure &amp; the decline of America‚Äôs economy.

The American people know that it‚Äôs Biden's radical agenda destroying our nation. https://t.co/dp8EzmfvC7"
RepDonaldsPress,"While Americans face unprecedented prices in every facet of their daily lives and parents desperately search shelves for baby formula, the DEMs are focused on relitigating 1/6. The American people are tired of these political games. It's time to work for the American people.

RepDonaldsPress,"Under the guise of Biden‚Äôs so-called ‚Äòleadership,‚Äô this admin has excessively wasted taxpayer funds by routinely providing cell phones to illegal immigrants‚Äîwhich are more than likely to be disposed of at a later date to avoid government detection.
https://t.co/D6RIoUwzsh"
RepDonaldsPress,"Today, I introduced the No More Phones Act to prohibit U.S. govt officials from using taxpayer funds to provide cell phones to illegal immigrants.

This common-sense legislation seeks to combat wasteful spending while simultaneously condemning Biden‚Äôs open-border catastrophe. https://t.co/l6aAnnNIUh"
RepDonaldsPress,"The Biden-Harris administration does more to support ending a pregnancy on-demand than supporting efforts to keep babies alive by addressing the baby formula crisis.
