JohnBoozman,"The #DisinformationGovernanceBoard represented an outrageous, unconstitutional attack on freedom of speech.

I fought to stop it, and welcome the failure of this attempted government censorship of Americans.

There's no room for this type of Big Brother overreach in the U.S. https://t.co/QrbTmKoNMS"
JohnBoozman,"We need to make it much easier to lease, go forward with oil &amp; gas exploration, and allow pipelines that deliver them in a very environmentally sensitive way to proceed.

JohnBoozman,"Gas prices are again at a record high – for the 9th-straight day – and diesel also keeps climbing, meaning the cost of everyday goods will keep rising because it's more expensive to transport them.

JohnBoozman,"Illegal immigration continues to surge at the southern border – 234,088 apprehensions last month. President Biden's immigration and border security policies are a disaster, and yet he still wants to lift Title 42 and open the floodgates. That can't happen.

JohnBoozman,"The Biden admin. has relied on an inflated ""Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases"" figure to oppose expanding natural gas infrastructure and limiting areas available for energy production, hurting American consumers.

We need to know if that continues, and why.

JohnBoozman,"Our farmers and ranchers are right to be worried. We’ve got to take steps that help them continue producing the most affordable, abundant food supply in the world — not exacerbating this crisis or pretending it’s not a problem. https://t.co/NY88L2G3XC"

We must use every resource available to stop these Mexican cartel-made drugs from flowing into our country, and strengthen substance abuse prevention and treatment efforts.
