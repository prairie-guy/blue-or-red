JayObernolte,California experiences both wet &amp; dry years. We must address our serious shortage of water storage with legislation such as the WOW Act &amp; Emergency Drought Relief Act that I’ve cosponsored to build our water reserves in the wet years &amp; ensure adequate supplies in the dry years.
JayObernolte,"More than half of the country's fruits, nuts, and vegetables are grown here in California. That production can't occur without reliable water, and the prices we pay for these vital foods will increase even further as supplies diminish."
JayObernolte,"Communities across the country will feel the effects of California's poor planning in water storage this summer with potential shortages of fruits, vegetables and nuts brought on by California's drought conditions and the global supply chain crisis."
JayObernolte,The Administration's cancelation of oil &amp; gas lease sales is another major misstep as Americans face record-high gas prices. We must return America to energy independence &amp; stop the disastrous impacts that these high energy prices have on working families. https://t.co/8HwRcVzLjh
JayObernolte,"I joined @SheriffDicus &amp; @SBCountySheriff Honor Guard to commemorate fallen law enforcement officers, including Sgt. Dominic Vaca, in our nation's capital this weekend. Thank you to these outstanding individuals &amp; all who put their lives on the line to keep our community safe. https://t.co/GXsubujtN6"
JayObernolte,"May 15 is National Peace Officer Memorial Day, where we honor law enforcement officers who lost their lives in the line of duty. Sadly, @SBCountySheriff Sgt. Dominic Vaca's name is newly carved on the Washington, D.C. memorial. He will be particularly remembered this year. https://t.co/PYsQBkuX7Y"
JayObernolte,"I was live on @MottekonMoney on Tuesday night to discuss rising gas prices and the devastating impact they are having on our community. If you missed the interview, you can catch it here: https://t.co/FPfVX8j08H"
JayObernolte,"A bill before @NatResources this week would ""conserve"" national forests by limiting roads. Unfortunately, this would both increase fires &amp; limit firefighting. Approx. 1/3 of roadless Natl Forest areas burned in the last 3 decades, while less than 1/5 of roaded areas have."
JayObernolte,"Regulations, taxes &amp; fees have resulted in CA gas prices roughly $1 higher than natl average. In addition, our home energy costs are some of the highest, yet our grid is unreliable. Our nation needs energy independence, not policies that have failed in CA. https://t.co/O8ARou3Reu"
JayObernolte,"As events begin in our nation’s Capital today in commemoration of National Police Week, please join me in taking a moment to recognize our law enforcement and the vital work they do to protect our families and our community. https://t.co/VHkqeZBEXA"
