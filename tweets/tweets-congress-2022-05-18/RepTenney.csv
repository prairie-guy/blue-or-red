RepTenney,"If you or someone you know needs help locating baby formula, please contact my office at 202-225-3665. We are here to help! https://t.co/YEjoczlXV2"
RepTenney,Honored to support passage of a bill tonight to ensure a wider range of baby formulas reach the most vulnerable. Next step is action by Biden to lift regulatory barriers that limit production &amp; remove restrictions that prevent well-regulated formulas from being imported. (1/2)
RepTenney,"When asked this week about inflation, Biden‚Äôs new Press Secretary couldn‚Äôt even answer the question. That shows you just how seriously he‚Äôs taking this economic crisis. Personnel is policy."
RepTenney,"Today @PressSec tried once again to pin BIDEN‚ÄôS ENERGY CRISIS on Putin. 

I busted this myth in my recent @WSJopinion piece.

RepTenney,".@SBAgov illicitly forgave nearly $70 million in pandemic relief loans to Planned Parenthood.

RepTenney,"üö®BREAKING: Biden‚Äôs Ministry of Truth is ‚Äúon pause.‚Äù 

He NEVER should have created it in the first place.

I‚Äôm continuing my fight in Congress to make sure this unconstitutional plan is never revived."
RepTenney,"Energy prices are already at record highs. Now, the Biden Admin is going to make oil &amp; gas even more expensive.

RepTenney,"Inflation makes it harder for lower- and middle-income Americans to make ends meet. It‚Äôs no wonder Americans are rating it as their top concern. 
 
A new poll from Pew Research found that a whopping 70% of Americans rate it as a very big problem, far more than any other issue."
RepTenney,"Last month 234,088 migrants were encountered at the Southern Border. This is the MOST in American history.

RepTenney,"A gallon of gas now costs $4.75, on average, in NY. This is the highest EVER recorded, &amp; an increase of 23 cents in just one week.

The #BidenPriceHike is unsustainable. The President must boost domestic energy production by expanding oil and gas lease sales on federal lands. (¬Ω)"
