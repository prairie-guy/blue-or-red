RepDavidKustoff,It was great to meet with advocates from @endalztn  including Terry Balton from Shelby County. Thank you for taking the time to share your personal stories with me. I look forward to continue working together to help find a cure to #EndAlz. https://t.co/Cv7LeonRHp
RepDavidKustoff,"Gas prices have skyrocketed under @JoeBiden due to his reckless economic policies. Since Jan 2021, we've gone from energy independence to reliance on foreign sources due to Biden’s overreaching &amp; burdensome energy policies. Americans are suffering because of @JoeBiden’s actions. https://t.co/VzDV6RCqBP"
RepDavidKustoff,"Our nation is experiencing a serious border crisis. Yet, @JoeBiden plans to end Title 42, an important tool that prevents illegal immigrants from crossing our border, next week. We must keep Title 42 and finish the border wall!

RepDavidKustoff,"I met with students from @DogwoodES, @FHES_gmsd, and Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic School in Germantown today in Washington. Thank you all for taking time out of your busy trip to talk with me! https://t.co/NoC4cAeuYU"
RepDavidKustoff,"Last year, I voted against @JoeBiden's partisan American Rescue Plan. This bill was costly and unnecessary. Now, even the experts are saying that inflation is at a 40-year high due to Biden’s excessive spending and the fiscal stimulus provided in the American Rescue Plan. https://t.co/uQn8Mzd49i"
RepDavidKustoff,"Roberta and I were saddened to hear about the passing of John Ryder. John was a brilliant lawyer and deeply cared about Memphis and Shelby County. John was a strong Republican leader at the local, state and national level. Our thoughts and prayers are with Lain and his daughters."
RepDavidKustoff,I met with members of the Southern Crop Production Association this week to discuss inflationary issues facing farmers and crop producers in West Tennessee and across the country. Thank you for sitting down with me. https://t.co/vsR3QXcIiS
RepDavidKustoff,Today is #PeaceOfficerMemorialDay. It is important we always honor and remember those officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. #BackTheBlue #NationalPoliceWeek https://t.co/S3hqdTp4Vw
RepDavidKustoff,"This week, we observed #NationalPoliceWeek. It's vital we always support our men &amp; women in law enforcement. The CPI also increased 8.3% in April from a year ago. This means more bad news for businesses &amp; hardworking Americans. Catch up on my week here: https://t.co/7N2dpL3Oip"
RepDavidKustoff,I joined @RepJimBanks &amp; @RepGregSteube to ask @SpeakerPelosi to bring the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act up for a vote. This bill ensures women receive a fair playing field in competitive sports by recognizing sex based on reproductive biology &amp; genetics at birth. https://t.co/PgYJy2OXt8
RepDavidKustoff,"I was glad to meet w/ Bobby White, Chief Public Policy Officer, &amp; Lydia Holmes, Director of Public Policy &amp; Advocacy w/ @MemphisChamber. Thanks for your work to ensure that economic growth &amp; development continue to occur in Memphis &amp; throughout West TN. Thanks for stopping by! https://t.co/o8Qeif6v6L"
RepDavidKustoff,"Under @JoeBiden's leadership, we are experiencing record-high inflation, a border crisis, skyrocketing gas prices, &amp; now a baby formula shortage. This is a real crisis for parents who are trying to feed their children, &amp; it is due to Biden's policies.

RepDavidKustoff,"Gas prices are the highest ever, yet @JoeBiden just canceled three major oil &amp; gas lease sales in Alaska &amp; the Gulf of Mexico. Biden’s reckless decisions have killed America’s energy independence and continue to hurt the pocketbooks of the American people.

RepDavidKustoff,I joined @GOPLeader and my colleagues at the National Law Enforcement Memorial to honor all of our nation’s fallen officers. Our men and women in law enforcement work tirelessly to save lives and change communities for the better. We must always #BackTheBlue. #NationalPoliceWeek https://t.co/eMdptlhl3b
RepDavidKustoff,"Thanks to TN members of @ASALifeline, including Dr. Chris Sharp, Dr. Jim West, &amp; Dr. Blas Catalani from Shelby Co, for sitting down w/ me. We discussed how Congress can help our providers in West TN &amp; throughout the country deliver the necessary services &amp; care to their patients. https://t.co/j4Lj1NRI8v"
