SenDanSullivan,"The ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù Wall Street firms today are the largest shareholders in over 90% of the S&amp;P. They‚Äôve often used this consolidated power to push political agendas most Americans oppose.

My INDEX Act would return the voting power to where it belongs‚Äîwith fund investors, not advisers. https://t.co/KpIwUr7Xx6"
SenDanSullivan,"BlackRock, State Street &amp; Vanguard  cast about ¬º of all votes at shareholder meetings.

SenDanSullivan,"I implore Joe Biden to abandon the radical left‚Äôs destructive anti-American energy agenda. There is another way. We can protect the environment AND unleash American energy. Read my American Energy, Jobs &amp; Climate plan, Mr. President.

SenDanSullivan,"Today, gas prices in Alaska hit a record: $5.

The sad truth is, the pain Americans experience each time they fill up their vehicle is part of an intentional plan by this administration‚Äîbeholden to the ultra-left‚Äîto drive up prices to ‚Äòaccelerate‚Äô the transition to renewables. https://t.co/txxeP4vctJ"
SenDanSullivan,"Alaskans are mourning the passing of a pioneering Alaskan, Joe Usibelli, Sr., who helped our state realize its great mineral potential. Julie and I offer our prayers and condolences to Peggy and the entire Usibelli family during this difficult time. https://t.co/aVVHu4BFD1"
SenDanSullivan,"With the signing of the American #Fisheries Advisory Committee Act, Alaskans will once again have a voice in directing the millions of federal grant dollars toward the priorities and needs of the fishing industry. https://t.co/p4PA1WvDCb"
SenDanSullivan,"For 50 years, Alaska‚Äôs &amp; America‚Äôs fishermen have lacked a meaningful seat at the table in the federal #fisheries grant process‚Äîa frustration brought to my attention by a Kodiak fisherman in 2015.

SenDanSullivan,"As Gina McCarthy celebrates this decision from the White House, rest assured Vladimir Putin is popping corks in the Kremlin."
SenDanSullivan,"The timing of this decision displays a disturbing disregard for the pain American families continue to feel at the pump, for the Americans whose livelihoods and communities depend on the industry, and for the grave consequences these policies have on national security."
SenDanSullivan,"If it weren‚Äôt evident before, today's announcement should make it crystal clear: Joe Biden and his administration are beholden to the radical left."
SenDanSullivan,"The administration claims there was ‚Äòno interest‚Äô among producers. As the former Natural Resources Commissioner for Alaska, I know there is no way they could have confirmed ‚Äòno interest‚Äô until they HELD the lease sale. Joe Biden is blatantly lying to the American people."
SenDanSullivan,"The nature by which this announcement came to news‚Äîfrom the White House's ultra-left Climate Czar Gina McCarthy, just down the hall from the President‚Äînot the Department of Interior‚Äîraises further questions over who is crafting these disastrous energy policies."
SenDanSullivan,"Just two days ago‚ÄîPresident Biden claimed again that he is doing ‚Äòeverything in his power‚Äô to bring down historically-high energy prices. The administration‚Äôs announcement that it will cancel these lease sales is just more proof that he is not.
