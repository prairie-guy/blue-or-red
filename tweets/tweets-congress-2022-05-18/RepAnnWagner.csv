RepAnnWagner,"I was honored to welcome the @gslhonorflight to Washington this morning.  

Our veterans are truly America’s heroes and I appreciated the opportunity to thank them while they visited the memorials that were built in their honor. https://t.co/5t41YvJVWK"
RepAnnWagner,I had a wonderful time showing some of our remarkable St. Louis County officers around the United States Capitol. We owe them a great debt of gratitude for their service and keeping us safe. https://t.co/KqCkc9x5eM
RepAnnWagner,I remain committed to strengthening U.S. engagement in the Southeast Asia region and will continue to work with my colleagues on this important issue.
RepAnnWagner,"The U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit will help us counter China’s attempts to dominate the region, and it will also be an important step in laying out a comprehensive strategy for the whole region."
RepAnnWagner,"ASEAN countries are critical partners in advancing shared economic growth and safeguarding regional security, and the U.S. must recognize our long-term strategic interests in Southeast Asia."
RepAnnWagner,I had an incredibly informative meeting with Heads of State from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ahead of the U.S.- ASEAN Summit. https://t.co/UVyAcjTT5y
RepAnnWagner,"I questioned Treasury Secretary Yellen about the Biden Administration’s out of control spending and how inflation and high gas prices are making life incredibly difficult for Missourians.

RepAnnWagner,"Congratulations Charlie and thank you for all you’ve done for the St. Louis region! Sad to see you go, but after 34 years, you’ve more than earned it.  @KMOXnews @charliekmox https://t.co/CHFtC5eret"
RepAnnWagner,"The final legislation must prevent the CCP from using American products to gain an edge, and it must impose robust and meaningful accountability measures for China’s egregious human rights violations."
RepAnnWagner,"Unfortunately, the House version of this bill does not reflect the gravity of this challenge. Republicans were blocked frm the drafting of this bill, &amp; it contains no export controls, nor does it include guardrails to ensure funding doesn't subsidize the Chinese Communist Party."
RepAnnWagner,"I am honored to serve as a conferee to the USICA and COMPETES Act.  

Maintaining the United States’ competitive edge over China is a generational challenge, and I believe this may be one of the most consequential legislative initiatives we will work on in our time in Congress. https://t.co/QxwJgC3cUL"
RepAnnWagner,"We held a press conference today on the baby formula shortage in Missouri &amp; across America.

As a mom of 3 &amp; grandmother of 2 &amp; another on the way, it is terrifying to think of the desperation parents are feeling when they cannot provide the basic necessities for their children. https://t.co/4NTE4gwryr"
