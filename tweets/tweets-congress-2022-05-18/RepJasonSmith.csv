RepJasonSmith,"The truth is Biden’s deficit would be worse if not for 2 key reasons:

- Failure to pass BBB which CBO confirmed would add $3 trillion in new debt."

The American people aren't buying it."
RepJasonSmith,"Oregon is sending $600 checks from “Rescue Plan” money to folks dealing with the high prices caused by the “Rescue Plan.”

RepJasonSmith,"This clip would be a great one for Biden's Disinformation Board to take a look at.

RepJasonSmith,"Here is @GeneSperling46, Biden's ""rescue czar"" in charge of overseeing the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that sparked the highest inflation in 40 years, blaming inflation on Putin's invasion.
