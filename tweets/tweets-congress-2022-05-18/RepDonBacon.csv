RepDonBacon,@Yankee18Michael We will discuss and help push along.
RepDonBacon,"Russian cyber experts are frequently attacking U.S. businesses with ransom-ware. Our cyber professionals in the Federal Govt must do more to protect against these attacks and stop these foreign hackers from preying on Americans and hurting our economy.

RepDonBacon,"@dontell51 We are, and we also defend people’s right to worship freely and to express their faith openly."
RepDonBacon,@CBakerShow @BenSasse Been there twice. We have a President who is not enforcing the law.
RepDonBacon,"My bill, HR 5658 - the DHS Roles and Responsibilities in Cyber Space Act, passed the House with a vote of 313 to 105! This is common-sense legislation, and with this strong showing of bipartisan support from the House, I look forward to this bill quickly becoming law. https://t.co/NsiUKkmCxY"
RepDonBacon,"Iranians want a government that respects their human rights. Iranians want freedom and a government that they can respect. We hope to see someday soon an Iran that safeguards its citizens freedoms, that is secular, nuclear weapons free and at peace with its neighbors. https://t.co/E6zV2zTwVW"
RepDonBacon,Glad to be a cosponsor of the Protect and Serve Act. Our law enforcement put their lives on the line to protect our communities. This bill establishes a new criminal offense for knowingly assaulting or attempting to cause serious bodily injury to a police officer. #BacktheBlue https://t.co/ROvnkXutb9
RepDonBacon,"ICYMI: @RepCarbajal and my firefighters bill passed last week. Firefighters suffer higher risk of cancer because of the smoke and toxic fumes they encounter while on duty. We need to support our firefighters who protect us.

RepDonBacon,Thank you to my constituent Nick Triantafillou for attending today's Joint Session with me. He and his wife Huong Truong are very kind and humble people. We enjoyed having them here in DC. https://t.co/kb8NkDyMRZ
RepDonBacon,Thank you to the @alzassociation for stopping by our DC office today! The Comprehensive Care for Alzheimer’s Act is just one of the many Alzheimer's bills I support. We need to keep raising awareness &amp; increasing funding for research at the NIH if we want to combat this disease. https://t.co/V1OMZMZeNQ
RepDonBacon,I re-introduced the Kerrie Orozco First Responders Support Act to allow the immediate relatives of first responders who die in the line of duty to continue processing their immigration application in a timely manner despite the death of their loved one. https://t.co/M2BtUx4Y6q https://t.co/CKzGwqIpjO
RepDonBacon,"My cyber security bill, H.R. 5658, just passed the House! A close partnership between the federal government and the private sector is vital to countering cyber-attacks from other countries that threaten our national security, economy, and way of life. https://t.co/ES49ktxiAC https://t.co/YA13DenLJC"
RepDonBacon,"Last week, @RepCarbajal and I passed H.R. 2499, the Federal Firefighters Fairness Act. Creating the presumption that federal firefighters who become disabled by serious diseases while on duty, ensures they receive treatment and benefits that would normally not be covered. https://t.co/Jv47r1Mpd7"
RepDonBacon,"Why is there a baby formula shortage??
❌ supply chain challenges
❌ product recalls
❌ historic inflation
And it started in July 2021!

RepDonBacon,@clnovoa You must be pretty partisan. I condemned the violence that day… and voted to certify.
RepDonBacon,"We love and respect our local law enforcement, and thank the many families who make it possible for their loved ones to serve. Today and every day, we honor those who have lost a loved one in the line of duty. We stand by you on good days and bad days.
https://t.co/V4d6bYB1l5"
RepDonBacon,My colleagues &amp; I urge  @SpeakerPelosi to bring HR 72-Thin Blue Line Act to a vote. This legislation would make the murder or attempted murder of a first responder a factor to be considered in death penalty decisions. Let's protect our frontline heroes. #NationalPoliceWeek https://t.co/mFBzYdb28r
RepDonBacon,We love our cops and and their families. I’m thankful to local law enforcement who asked me to speak at the Police Memorial Service as we honored those families who lost loved ones. We stand by our police and protect them from damaging legislation that undermines public safety. https://t.co/5M9uA8esPQ
RepDonBacon,"In honor of #EMSWeek, we humbly thank our EMTs and paramedics for protecting the health and well-being of all Nebraskans. We appreciate your dedication and selfless service to our communities. https://t.co/twkQvKIk6E"
RepDonBacon,"In 1962, President Kennedy proclaimed May 15 as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. On this day, we remember those law enforcement officers who made the ultimate sacrifice, as well as the family, friends, and fellow officers they left behind. https://t.co/tI3GjlgECZ"
RepDonBacon,Stay updated with our office by following us on social media! You can also visit my Congressional website at https://t.co/jn1BCHiklP. https://t.co/yUjIa7ZREG
RepDonBacon,@janeoftheplains Glad to humor you!
RepDonBacon,"My House colleagues and I introduced the #BacktheBlue Act which seeks to ensure our law enforcement officers, federal judges, and public safety officers, including firefighters, chaplains and rescue crews, are afforded greater protections. https://t.co/8s8s3X5ClR https://t.co/dijQqDNcOT"
RepDonBacon,@SecularDemsOfNE You go ahead and eat them.
RepDonBacon,"Today we announced the winners of the Congressional Art Competition at KANEKO art gallery! Congrats to Chloe Rankin (1st place), B.

RepDonBacon,@CBakerShow May take an election victory.
RepDonBacon,@gkize This Admin = 1984.
RepDonBacon,Lots of questions about the President’s Ministry of Truth (Disinformation Governance Board) and my colleagues and I demand answers! This is something you see in the People’s Republic of China or North Korea. https://t.co/zfvH9piHNH
RepDonBacon,"Russia continues to follow in the footsteps of its Soviet predecessors, terrorizing the citizens of Ukraine. We condemn all genocides, past, present, and future. I thank @RepSpartz, @RepSchneider &amp; @RepSpanberger for their partnership on this legislation. https://t.co/4quoRE2SKR"
RepDonBacon,"As co-chairs of the For Country Caucus, @RepGolden and I are committed to using our military expertise and love for our country to break through political dysfunction in Congress. https://t.co/GFeB9Aes7H"
RepDonBacon,@HuskerPolitics It was caused by the bill… that was passed by party line vote.
RepDonBacon,"Even left-leaning VOX admits Biden &amp; Pelosi's $1.9T COVID bill triggered the worst inflation in 40 YEARS, saying US has higher inflation vs most countries because this hyper-partisan bill passed by a party-line vote. American families are paying the cost. 
https://t.co/ASZWozjV3E"
RepDonBacon,"Thank you to our DC intern and Nebraska native, Elise Roselius. She is currently studying political science &amp; religion and philosophy with a minor in business administration at Nebraska Wesleyan University. I admire her strong work ethic, cooperation, and determination to learn. https://t.co/iSY7eSPa4z"
RepDonBacon,"As a foster to adopt parent, and as co-chair of the Foster Youth Caucus, I thank @GovRicketts for bringing attention to the need for foster parents in Nebraska and declaring May as “Foster Care Month” in the state.
https://t.co/0xYfuzvajP"
RepDonBacon,"May is Mental Health Awareness Month. We need to raise awareness of those living with mental and behavioral health issues, and continue the fight in ending the stigma associated with both.

During his internship, he enjoyed helping our team provide resources to constituents and reuniting them with family overseas, including those left in Afghanistan. https://t.co/aSrjaMjJyR"
RepDonBacon,"@kcleighroy I support the Senate bill that passed unanimously. If House had passed it, it would be law today and in action. Instead, nothing has passed and veterans are waiting. Pelosi hurt veterans by not passing the Senate bill."
