CongPalazzo,Good riddance to Biden’s “Ministry of Truth.” My only complaint is that it took three weeks for them to realize it was problematic and the American people wouldn’t stand for it.
CongPalazzo,"Thanks to everyone who has reached out to my office about the formula shortage. I’m happy to see the successes we’ve had so far. While we can’t guarantee specific formulas, we are working hard to get parents in touch with manufacturers. Please call 601-582-3246 for assistance. https://t.co/nXGdMSXKEZ"
CongPalazzo,"President Biden is setting all sorts of records. A historic 235,000 illegal immigrants tried to cross our southern border in April thanks to the welcome mat he’s laid out and he still wants to end Title 42."
CongPalazzo,"Murdering babies isn’t healthcare, and @PPFA is profiting off of the deaths happening at their own hands.  Thank you, @RepJeffDuncan for continuing the fight for life. https://t.co/HQkqLacTV3"
CongPalazzo,"THIS SATURDAY! I’m hosting my annual Academy Day from 8-11 in Biloxi. Be sure to RSVP on my website, or call my office at 228-864-7670. I look forward to seeing you all then! https://t.co/cn4qyIgIXA"
CongPalazzo,"Our frontline officers deserve better, and cop killers should be persecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I'm proud to back the Thin Blue Line Act led by @VernBuchanan. https://t.co/ZfwrUEE01s"
CongPalazzo,"Now it’s this Administration’s turn to implement a permanent policy to protect our southern border!

CongPalazzo,Extend Title 42 and stop the drug smuggling. Thank you to @DesJarlaisTN04 for introducing this common sense legislation to protect our border and Americans from these dangerous drugs. https://t.co/W184Ol29RB
CongPalazzo,"At what point do Democrats realize how insane their actions are? Fighting to take innocent lives through abortions, and sending illegal border crossers baby formula while American parents are struggling to find it in our stores. How can they defend this with a straight face!"
CongPalazzo,"If President Biden’s plan to Build Back Better includes jacking gas prices up even higher by cancelling offshore oil and gas lease sales, then he’s doing a great job. America will never be energy independent under his failed leadership."
CongPalazzo,"Mississippi’s aviation infrastructure will greatly benefit from these AIP grants. Several of these projects will directly improve many of the airfields and runways in #MS04.
