RepGaramendi,The current baby formula shortage is a national embarrassment. Greedy companies failed to invest in failing equipment — putting infants at risk so they could reward investors with stock buy-backs. Today I called for President Biden to take action to ensure no child goes hungry. https://t.co/k1JvhHtTxm
RepGaramendi,I have heard the UC Davis students loud and clear and today I would like to announce that I support their Moovement to replace Gunrock with a cow. @cow4mascot https://t.co/8tEneKbMf7 https://t.co/nOXrUmjedE
RepGaramendi,"Those spreading the toxic ideology of White Supremacy and the myth of a “great replacement” have no place in our political discourse. It shouldn’t have to be said, but the prevalence of these ideologies demands rejection and condemnation by all elected leaders."
RepGaramendi,I voted for the first assault weapons bill in the country while in the state legislature and I am calling upon my colleagues in Congress to put an end to the daily shootings. We must re-institute the nationwide assault weapons ban.
RepGaramendi,"Patti and I are deeply saddened by the news of yet another mass shooting — this time at a Church in Laguna Woods. The victims and their families are in our prayers, but we must do more. Weapons of war need to be taken off our streets."
RepGaramendi,"Yesterday a vile act of racist violence claimed another ten lives, this time in Buffalo. The regularity of these mass casualty events and the near constant threat of racist violence is unacceptable. I will continue my decades-long efforts to keep assault rifles off of our streets"
RepGaramendi,"Next week, I’ll vote to pass legislation to crack down against price gouging in our economy that is harming working families across America."
RepGaramendi,"Today I was happy to speak about my bill —the Ocean Shipping Reform Act — which will fight inflation and protect American jobs. I’m excited to see this bill get through Congress, on the Presidents desk and bring much-needed relief to working families. https://t.co/ltlAhg9eki"
