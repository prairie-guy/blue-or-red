RepLaMalfa,"Hereâ€™s a better headline: Bidenâ€™s unconstitutional Ministry of Truth fails. Free speech, freedom of expression, and free press prevails.
 
Who needs a state-sponsored propaganda machine when we already have the entire mainstream media? https://t.co/hAg04QdNh1"
RepLaMalfa,"Whose side is President Biden on? Itâ€™s certainly not Americaâ€™s. President Biden shut down domestic gas and oil production while forcing us to pay top dollar for Saudi oil. 
 
Saudi oil tycoons are celebrating record profits while the American people pick up the tab. https://t.co/LSY57krSP2"
RepLaMalfa,"Americans are paying more for just about everything thanks to #Bidenflation, and wages canâ€™t keep up. Gas, food, vehicles, and clothing prices are all rising. The American people need financial relief, stop the reckless government spending. https://t.co/3XzwveyrkF"
RepLaMalfa,"Last fall I had the opportunity to see these illegal grows firsthand. They steal water, poison wildlife, trash our wildlands and pose a grave threat to nearby residents. Thank you @SiskiyouSheriff for your work combatting this. @GavinNewsom its time to crack down on illegal grows https://t.co/zgafsbgOe9"
RepLaMalfa,"Our nationâ€™s veterans are struggling to find medical help and American families canâ€™t find baby formula to feed their infants. Stop giving away these lifesaving goods and services to those entering our country illegally, and start putting Americans first."
RepLaMalfa,"Another day in President Bidenâ€™s America, another record high gas price.
 
Remember, this price spike isnâ€™t caused by a conflict overseas. It began day 1 of Bidenâ€™s term when he froze Keystone, cancelled oil and gas lease sales, and began his anti-American energy crusade."
RepLaMalfa,"Amid yet another high gas price record, President Biden is doubling down on his failed energy policies and has shut down a massive domestic oil and gas lease. Biden needs to stop putting Americans last and start drilling."
RepLaMalfa,"I stand for law and order. I stand with those who carry the badge, risking their lives to keep us safe. I stand to #BackTheBlue ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ https://t.co/jSGxB0yJtA"
RepLaMalfa,"Earlier this year the Biden Administration was literally giving away free crack pipes. Now, mothers are struggling to find formula at the grocery stores to feed their babies. 
 
Itâ€™s obvious where the administrationâ€™s priorities are. https://t.co/31RFUhiZzs"
RepLaMalfa,"Federal law explicitly prohibits coercion by protests outside a judgeâ€™s house. Not to mention, itâ€™s always illegal to firebomb a pro-life office and threaten a judgeâ€™s family. The Biden Admin must speak out against this obstruction of justice.

RepLaMalfa,The stats are clear: going after law abiding citizens with guns and vilifying law enforcement personnel who are trying to keep us safe wonâ€™t curb crime. Start getting serious about locking up criminals and give our police departments the resources they need to stop crime. https://t.co/bUkHBAe8oY
