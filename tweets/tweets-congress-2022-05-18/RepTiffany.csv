RepTiffany,"This week, I asked President Biden to¬†visit #Taiwan and meet with President Tsai @iingwen during his trip to Asia. I sincerely hope he will consider doing so. America doesn't need a permission slip from #China to talk to our friends and partners.

RepTiffany,"Back in February, Joe Biden said he was using ‚Äúevery tool‚Äù to bring down gas prices.

Fast forward to May, and gas prices are still at an all-time high.

RepTiffany,"Despite the fact that the gray wolf has recovered, radical environmentalists, with help from a California judge, have re-listed the gray wolf, posing an ongoing threat to farmers and pet owners in Wisconsin.

RepTiffany,"At a time when Americans can barely afford groceries, families cannot find baby formula, and gas prices are at an all-time high, the Biden administration is focused on canceling oil &amp; gas leases, spending $40 billion in Ukraine, and being the arbiter of truth.
