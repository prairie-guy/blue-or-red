RepBarbaraLee,"I applaud @POTUS for hearing our call and swiftly invoking the Defense Production Act to address the infant formula shortage emergency.

It is imperative that we never repeat such a crisis. https://t.co/C6MiTAPz5i"
RepBarbaraLee,"A huge, hard-fought win for #USWMT and the entire labor movement.

This didn’t happen overnight. It happened thanks to years of courage, dedication, and fierce advocacy by @mPinoe &amp; countless others.

Now let's ensure equal pay for equal (or superior😉) work in every industry. https://t.co/Tiy16dc3Cx"
RepBarbaraLee,Proud to support @RepThompson’s efforts to secure this critical funding for CA producers &amp; growers impacted by wildfires &amp; natural disasters. https://t.co/ASglR9ZnVu
RepBarbaraLee,"It was an honor to meet Greek PM @PrimeministerGR &amp; his family today alongside @CALtGovernor. Whether supporting Ukraine, phasing out fossil fuels and fighting climate change, or working to humanely support refugees, our nations are linked by our shared purpose and values. 🇬🇷🤝🇺🇸 https://t.co/2rHFXbnlVk"
RepBarbaraLee,"On International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia &amp; Biphobia, I’m thinking of the nearly 60,000 trans youth in the US who are at risk of losing access to potentially lifesaving gender-affirming treatments.

Anti-trans laws make everyone less safe.

RepBarbaraLee,I look forward to working with @POTUS to continue advancing US-Cuban relations and ensure a brighter future for the Cuban people.
RepBarbaraLee,These important changes will help people and families both in Cuba and the US. But our work can’t end here. We must do more to reverse years of harmful and counterproductive policies and create opportunity on the island.
RepBarbaraLee,"Today, @POTUS took steps to reverse more oppressive Trump-era policies—this time on Cuba.

The U.S. will now resume the family reunification program, increase flights to Cuba, &amp; lift restrictions on remittances; all overdue, much-needed steps that will support the Cuban people."
RepBarbaraLee,"Bay Area families face some of the HIGHEST housing costs in the US.

For them &amp; for all Americans struggling to make rent, I commend @POTUS &amp; @SecFudge for leading this groundbreaking all-of-government effort to close the housing supply shortfall.

Housing is a human right. 🏠👏🏾 https://t.co/wqe7uC3nsZ"
RepBarbaraLee,"The “anti-CRT” and extremist online movements are not just debates about free speech.
 
They perpetuate harmful, deadly, white supremacist ideologies that can take Black lives.
 
To ignore this pipeline is to enable the violence to continue."
RepBarbaraLee,"Congrats again, Haley, as you continue to celebrate your extraordinary achievements today! You are a testament to your family’s supporting and loving parenting. Have fun and enjoy your day❤️ https://t.co/iy6eOZuZpE"
RepBarbaraLee,"99.7% of those with federal loans didn’t attend an Ivy League school.
 
Cancelling student loan debt is not a windfall for the rich. It’s a lifeline for working Americans."
RepBarbaraLee,"Sending my deepest condolences to the families of the victims of the Buffalo shooting.

This was a racially motivated mass murder.

As we are tragically reminded, the greatest domestic terror threat is gun violence from extremist white supremacists."
RepBarbaraLee,"I am so incredibly proud of my goddaughter Haley, who at just 19 years old has become the youngest Black woman to ever graduate from law school in the US😱👏🏾

Congratulations, Haley! You are amazing! https://t.co/vpjqHvcQhH"

RepBarbaraLee,"Not being able to feed your baby is a parent’s worst nightmare—one that low-income families know too well. As we work to relieve the formula crisis, let’s not forget which party chose to push 3.7 million children back into poverty last fall.

Bring back the #ChildTaxCredit."
RepBarbaraLee,"I commend @POTUS for securing $3B in pledges for the global effort to fight #COVID19🌎💉
 
It is far past time for Republicans to end their shortsighted, dangerous opposition to emergency funding for the global recovery &amp; to prevent new, more deadly variants. #GlobalCOVIDSummit https://t.co/812hzrgpDe"
RepBarbaraLee,"Health care is a human right—one that a country as wealthy as the US has no excuse to deny.

Thrilled to see this historic hearing on #MedicareforAll happen in the Senate today. https://t.co/UpN4Ml9DNz"
