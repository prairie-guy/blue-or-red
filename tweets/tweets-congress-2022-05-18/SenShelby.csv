SenShelby,I enjoyed meeting with @North_Alabama President @Ken_Kitts and others from the University yesterday afternoon. It was great to hear about UNA’s growing enrollment and the many ways they ready their students to be an integral part of Alabama's workforce. Go Lions! https://t.co/Ds26qvWPzX
SenShelby,"Very proud to see #Huntsville, Alabama, has been rated the nation's best place to live by @USNews. The #RocketCity boasts a strong job market coupled with competitive salaries, affordable housing, excellent schools, and major opportunities for success. Living there can't be beat. https://t.co/6OES4VXjt1"
SenShelby,"Major news from @USDA: Later this month, ag producers who suffered significant crop losses due to natural disasters in 2020 &amp; 2021 will begin receiving pre-filled applications to register for emergency relief. Simply sign the forms and submit them to a local FSA county office. https://t.co/WE5NemJrmQ"
SenShelby,Sat down this week with @ULALaunch CEO @ToryBruno to talk about the important manufacturing and assembly work done in their #Decatur factory. Alabama serves a major role in the space and rocket industry. I'm proud to know that our workforce is the best for the job. #MadeinAlabama https://t.co/80sDceioVS
SenShelby,"This week, I met with @AirbusInTheUS CEO Jeff Knittel. We discussed their growing presence in #Alabama &amp; their decision to add a third final assembly line at its #Mobile factory. This expansion project will create 1,000 new jobs. It's great to see companies thrive in AL. https://t.co/lqMYNDGbhv"
SenShelby,It’s a shame that the Ukraine military and humanitarian relief has been held up in the U.S. Senate. Ukrainians are fighting for their lives and their freedom against the Russians. We need to help them now.
SenShelby,"Today, I voted no on the reconfirmation of Jay Powell to be Chairman of the @FederalReserve. American families are facing rampant inflation and historically high prices. Powell and the rest of the Fed have failed the American people. We should not reward failure."
SenShelby,"I'll be supporting the Ukraine Supplemental, and it should receive broad bipartisan support. We succeeded in eliminating the unrelated funding &amp; controversial legislative provisions – and secured funds to ensure that our own munitions stocks remain intact. https://t.co/mbdpuzw4iT"
SenShelby,I'm pleased that @USDOT recognizes the importance of investing in Alabama's rapidly growing aviation industry. I look forward to seeing how this $12.5 million helps many of our airports better serve their communities and contribute to local economies. https://t.co/p6qaM9O4Fh
