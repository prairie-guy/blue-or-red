RepChuyGarcia,"Babies and infants can‚Äôt wait, our families need relief. That‚Äôs why I voted for the Access To Baby Formula Act, which approves $28 million in emergency funding for @US_FDA to help address the formula shortage. https://t.co/qXoYPsIZOk"
RepChuyGarcia,"In 10 minutes, I‚Äôll be joining @Public_Citizen, @SteelWorkers, @AFLCIO and others for a special event to discuss big victories for Mexico's independent unions and the role of cross-border solidarity.

RepChuyGarcia,"Union busting is disgusting. There‚Äôs power in a union, and clearly @ElonMusk is scared of workers advocating for their rights to safety, dignity, and respect on the job. https://t.co/swHUgn01za"
RepChuyGarcia,Today would be a great day for @POTUS to #CancelStudentDebt.
RepChuyGarcia,"Amidst infant formula shortages across the country, families are going to bed wondering how they will get their babies the food they need.
 
This is why I am voting to pass urgently needed emergency funding that will help fix this shortage quickly and work to #FeedOurInfants. https://t.co/z4PJBBr5Fp"
RepChuyGarcia,"The labor movement is diverse and strong. @McDonalds workers in Chicago are standing up to demand fair treatment, and respect on the job. All workers deserve to be treated fairly, I support their right to seek union representation. When unions fight, workers win. #UnionsForAll https://t.co/CBnwyS2Rqc"
RepChuyGarcia,"I‚Äôm proud of @USWNT for keeping their eye on the ball, and fighting for equality in sports. They scored big time, and now will get equal pay for equal work. This is a shining example of workers fighting for their rights and winning. We should all celebrate this momentous victory. https://t.co/nvwTEB4OX8"
RepChuyGarcia,"It‚Äôs hypocritical that @RepMTG had the choice to become a mother, but she doesn‚Äôt want you to have that same choice. Everyone, no matter where they come from should have the right to make their own decision and choice about their own reproductive rights. #ProtectRoe https://t.co/2WZykaBIsh"
RepChuyGarcia,"This begins with swiftly implement policies like eliminating the 85th percentile rule, updating NHTSA's NCAP regulations to better protect pedestrians and cyclists, and building out better cycling and walking infrastructure. We cannot accept this level of carnage on our roadways."
RepChuyGarcia,Today's @NHTSAgov release of 2021 traffic safety data showing a 16 year high in fatalities on our roadways should be a wake up call. We need to take action to make our streets and highways safer for all who use them. https://t.co/ctr9719SE9
RepChuyGarcia,"üö® UPDATE üö® You can order another round of free at-home COVID Tests through @USPS. You can receive up to 8 additional tests per address. Follow the link belowüëáüèΩ

RepChuyGarcia,But there is more work to do. We must continue to dismantle policies that add to the suffering of those on the island. We must end our blockade against Cuba.
RepChuyGarcia,.@POTUS is lifting Trump-era restrictions that prevent Cuban-Americans from sending life-saving remittances to their families. This is a vital step forward in supporting the Cuban people. https://t.co/rYiPWJx3wr
RepChuyGarcia,"Today, on International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia &amp; Transphobia ‚Äî and every day ‚Äî¬†I'm proud to stand up for equality for all and against discrimination and violence against the LGBTQI+ community. #IDAHOBIT https://t.co/qsi4U41cVU"
RepChuyGarcia,"Murals tell our stories. This weekend I had the pleasure of meeting artists Hector Duarte and Gabriel Villa who unveiled a new mural.

RepChuyGarcia,@itskylelucas @ITSoFRISCHial @internetarchive @waybackmachine Happy to help make it happen. Have a nice night.
RepChuyGarcia,@itskylelucas @ITSoFRISCHial @internetarchive @waybackmachine This should be it. https://t.co/gDTtRumiOK
RepChuyGarcia,@itskylelucas @LenaGReynolds Here you go. This should do the trick. https://t.co/gDTtRumiOK
RepChuyGarcia,"We need to change the draconian immigration laws that place an undue burden on our communities. We must pass the New Way Forward Act to roll back policies that result in racial profiling, disproportionate incarceration, deportation, and the separation of immigrant families."
RepChuyGarcia,The conservative Justices have now decided that a clerical error and paperwork mistake is reason enough to expel his entire family permanently from the country. This exemplifies why we need to fix our broken immigration system.
RepChuyGarcia,"When federal courts said they had no jurisdiction to review mistakes like this, our legal system failed Mr. Patel and the case ended up in front of the Supreme Court."
RepChuyGarcia,"üßµToday‚Äôs decision on immigration by SCOTUS is cruel. Mr. Patel spent decades in the U.S. as a permanent resident, but now faces deportation for simply checking the wrong box on a driver‚Äôs license renewal application. We need to fix this broken system. https://t.co/tnTt3wkrY2"
RepChuyGarcia,"Though ethnically and racially motivated hate has taken many forms, it‚Äôs most recent perpetuators are the GOP. On the House floor, I often hear Republican colleagues refer to immigrants and asylum seekers as invaders of our country, further perpetuating xenophobia and racism."
RepChuyGarcia,"I am devastated by the Buffalo shooting and grieve for victims and families.

But grief isn‚Äôt enough. Reports suggest the killer is a white supremacist. Domestic terrorism against Black and Brown communities has deep roots in our country. We must address it as the threat it is. https://t.co/70wVd0SFIE"
RepChuyGarcia,Today people are rallying across the country to say #BansOffOurBodies. We need to #ProtectRoe and a woman‚Äôs right to make their own health care decisions. I was proud to join those out in force today in Chicago to make their voices heard. https://t.co/QG87QLxtci

We look forward to a vote on the Senate floor ASAP to help the people of @Ukraine in their time of need. https://t.co/RtZBcG1Xp5"
RepChuyGarcia,"As a former paralegal, I know it can be grueling work. Paralegals at Hudson Legal have said loud &amp; clear that they want a union. A law firm of all places, should know that the right to organize is the law of the land. I join with @HWUnited in their call to to end the retaliation! https://t.co/KtfjCXVmhs"
RepChuyGarcia,"For Guatemala to thrive, the Guatemalan people need to feel safe. Safety is not possible if the police and military operate in a climate of impunity. https://t.co/C3sEpfh8oN"
RepChuyGarcia,"A√±os de sanciones econ√≥micas indiscriminadas s√≥lo han logrado el sufrimiento de los inocentes en Venezuela.

RepChuyGarcia,"It was an honor to meet environmental, human rights defender, and Colombian VP candidate @FranciaMarquezM. The historic significance of her candidacy as an Afro-Colombian woman who fights for the ‚Äúnadies,‚Äù the nobodies, is an inspiration for progressives throughout the Americas. https://t.co/Qv1xYyAAkC"
RepChuyGarcia,This #NationalNursesWeek I thank our nurses for always stepping up. Like the nurses at @LoyolaHealth Macneal Hospital who care for clients seeking protection after experiencing trauma including human trafficking and sexual &amp; gender based violence. Thank you for all you do! https://t.co/kad611Apb0
RepChuyGarcia,"In today‚Äôs @FSCDems, @SecYellen agreed that we need to close the ILC Loophole to address a long standing threat to our financial stability.

Companies like @Amazon, @Facebook, and @Walmart aren‚Äôt banks, and they shouldn‚Äôt be able to buy and operate them. My bill makes that law. https://t.co/0YkXgKyejB"
RepChuyGarcia,"@geniekastrup Proud to stand with you and @SEIULocal1, now and always."
