RepLarryBucshon,"It is critical that we find a path forward in the House to pass the VALID act. By modernizing the way @US_FDA reviews and approves diagnostic tests, we can ensure that Americans have access to safe and accurate tests that promotes public safety and spurs innovation. https://t.co/7VVml0QXsh"
RepLarryBucshon,.@GOPHELP included the VALID Act in their FDA user fee reauthorization package. @RepDianaDeGette and I have been working with our colleagues in the Senate for over five years to advance diagnostic testing reform to modernize our nation's healthcare system. https://t.co/dZdAQBrCwQ

RepLarryBucshon,The White House made a blatantly false statement on Twitter about vaccine availability at the end of the Trump Admin. This needs to be labeled as false. President Biden and 3 million Americans had received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine prior to his inauguration. 18 M one dose.
RepLarryBucshon,"It is devastating that the number of overdoses continues skyrocket. Congress must enact legislation like the HALT Fentanyl Act, and hold both China and the cartels to account for their role in spreading these deadly drugs throughout the US. https://t.co/mDGoW5oNFl"
