RepJasonCrow,Thoughts and prayers will not bring these children back. And it clearly won’t stop the next shooting. It never has. This is a policy problem. If you’re an elected official who won’t join me to fix this sit down and shut up. 
RepJasonCrow,While serving in the Army I was stationed at Fort Benning and Fort Bragg.Here’s my full statement on the news that these bases will be renamed ⬇️ 
RepJasonCrow,The teacher shortage is putting a strain on our teachers &amp; our kids.Great meeting with @NEAToday about my Teacher Principal &amp; Leader Residency Access Act.This bill will equip more diverse passionate educators with the hands-on teaching experience they need! 
RepJasonCrow,The cost of oil is going down but Big Oil CEOs are keeping gas prices high and delivering big payouts to shareholders.This greed is hurting Coloradans.I voted to hold Big Oil accountable so they stop #RippingOffAmericans. 
RepJasonCrow,It’s important to me that our community has access to the support systems we need.Proud to announce my latest direct funding requests which will begin addressing the mental health crisis &amp; ensure everyone in our community has the opportunity to thrive.
RepJasonCrow,Colorado's population is expected to grow by another 35%. But we can alleviate the already packed roads AND work toward our climate goals by building a passenger rail line along the front range.We’re working to use infrastructure funding we passed to make this train a reality! 
RepJasonCrow,Increasingly Coloradans can’t afford to live in the communities they call home.Glad @POTUS is taking steps to alleviate this burden. These measures will go a long way to make rent more affordable &amp; homeownership more attainable for folks in Colorado.
RepJasonCrow,We passed the 19th amendment 103 years ago today–yet we’re still fighting for equal pay equal access &amp; equal protections for women.The latest threat to Roe underlines the next urgent step in the fight for equality: we must #EndTheFilibuster &amp; enshrine abortion access in law. 
RepJasonCrow,Had a wonderful time meeting students from @Academy_LPS this week.These 8th graders had thoughtful questions on Ukraine SCOTUS and the global economy. So great to see our young people staying curious and informed! 
RepJasonCrow,Had an inspirational conversation this week with @UofDenver's impressive @icapfellows.DU is still taking submissions from the next generation of diverse leaders in foreign affairs government &amp; non-profit work.Find more info on the program here⤵️
RepJasonCrow,The horrific shooting in Buffalo was a painful reminder of what we already knew: rising domestic extremism is endangering American lives.This week I voted to increase law enforcement’s response to curb violent domestic extremism &amp; white supremacy groups.
RepJasonCrow,Just weeks ago I heard directly from @ZelenskyyUA about what Ukrainians need to keep winning their fight against Russia’s invasion.Grateful to have made good on that promise by passing this aid package to #SupportUkraine. 
RepJasonCrow,PASSED: Relief for families experiencing the infant formula shortage.As a dad I understand the stress this shortage is putting on families. Babies can’t wait to eat.Glad to deliver quick help for parents now – &amp; a backstop so it never happens again.
RepJasonCrow,Great seeing @CapsPup on the Hill spreading awareness for a bill that will connect more vets and first responders with highly-trained service animals.It was an easy YES to sign onto the bill – especially after meeting Biscuit. 
RepJasonCrow,NEW: @RepJeffries @RepKatiePorter @RepHaleyStevens &amp; I just introduced our newest gun violence prevention bill after 8 deadly US shootings in just 72 hours.We can't normalize these tragedies. Our measure will close a gun sales loophole &amp; help to end this horrific epidemic. 
RepJasonCrow,Conservative SCOTUS justices have ruled that it was okay for Ted Cruz to make campaign donors re-pay his personal debts. This is a dangerous precedent that encourages corruption. It’s bad for average voters and it’s bad for the future of our democracy.
