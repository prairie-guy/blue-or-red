DrNealDunnFL2,Heartbreaking. Absolutely heartbreaking. So much innocence was snatched away by pure evil. Please join me in praying for the students teachers staff &amp; their families at this time. They're going to need strength &amp; support in the days ahead. 
DrNealDunnFL2,Happy Armed Forces Day to those serving in the U.S. Military and their families! Thank you for your bravery sacrifice and service to this country! #ArmedForcesDay #FL02 
DrNealDunnFL2,ICYMI - My colleagues &amp; I promptly sent a letter to Pres. Biden &amp; the FDA Commissioner demanding information about how the FDA will mitigate the #formulashortage. Read the FULL letter here:  #FL02
