RepLoriTrahan,I'm at a loss. I just picked up my girls from the bus stop. This is every parent's worst nightmare.Shame on anyone who says we can’t do more to prevent school shootings especially elected officials who oppose even the most basic commonsense gun safety legislation. 
RepLoriTrahan,Yesterday I joined Frederick Beeley a World War II veteran and Methuen resident for his 100th birthday. Frederick served courageously in the U.S. Army and has dedicated his life to his loving family &amp; his community. I'm grateful I had the chance to thank him personally! 
RepLoriTrahan,Thank you to everyone who came to my town meeting in Haverhill this morning! My job is to make your voices heard in Washington and I’m grateful to everyone who showed up shared their thoughts and asked important questions. 
RepLoriTrahan,If Vladimir Putin thinks permanently banning me from Russia is going to change my support for Ukraine I’ve got bad news for him. It’s not. The United States stands with Ukraine.

RepLoriTrahan,Thrilled to welcome U.S. Education @SecCardona to my alma mater @LowellHigh to see firsthand how students are recovering from the pandemic. It was great to hear from students in the Early College &amp; career pathway programs that are preparing students for success after graduation! 
RepLoriTrahan,Since I first got to Congress three years ago I've been pressing the @DeptVetAffairs to do everything possible to help veterans who were exposed to toxic burn pits &amp; chemicals. This agreement will be a HUGE and long overdue boost to those efforts!
RepLoriTrahan,Millions of babies across our nation need formula and the bills we passed this week will help them get it. If you're wondering why nearly every Republican in Congress opposed legislation to help address the baby formula crisis you're not alone. 
RepLoriTrahan,#AAPIHeritageMonth isn't just about celebrating the culture and contributions of Asian Americans. It's also about working to create a nation where every person – regardless of their race – can live without fear of being discriminated against because of who they are. #StopAAPIHate
RepLoriTrahan,You know who isn't hurting from high gas prices right now? Oil corporations.5 Big Oil companies more than tripled their profits in the first three months of 2022. And they used those profits to line the pockets of millionaire CEOs &amp; execs with more money.
RepLoriTrahan,@tweetinjules @CCDHate @eSafetyOffice Grateful for the chance to meet and for all you’re doing already on this important issue!
RepLoriTrahan,JOIN ME: This Sunday at 10am I'm hosting a town meeting at the Haverhill Public Library to hear about the issues that matter most to you and to folks across #MA3.Please join us for this important discussion. We'll bring the coffee! 
RepLoriTrahan,The baby formula crisis is affecting thousands of Massachusetts families.Yesterday I demanded answers from a formula company that has decreased production &amp; made the shortage worse.Today I voted to expand access for families who purchase formula using WIC.
RepLoriTrahan,This is huge: Two bipartisan bills I introduced to help address the addiction crisis and prevent youth suicides were just approved by the @EnergyCommerce Committee! These bills are now headed to the floor for final passage! More on one of those bills⬇️ 
RepLoriTrahan,The Circle Street Bridge and Water Street Bridge projects in Fitchburg have been delayed for too long. The #BipartisanInfrastructureLaw is going to get these critical projects done and it's going to do the same in communities across the Commonwealth!
