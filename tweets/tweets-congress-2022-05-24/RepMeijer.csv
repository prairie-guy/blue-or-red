RepMeijer, 
RepMeijer,Of course the point of this bill was to show Congress is “doing something” even if that ‘something’ wouldn’t actually do anything. They aren’t looking for a solution just something to fill in the blank of a defensive talking point. (2/2)   
RepMeijer,This bill is so dumb that a part of me wants it to become law to prove it’s unworkability. (It won’t.)Ignore for a second that price controls always backfire. Here gas stations would basically be forced to collude on prices to avoid being accused of ‘gouging.’ Amazing. (1/2) 
RepMeijer,@DRMDCL That may be a different bill (with same numbering) from a prior Congress. Here is the HR 7790 from the 117th that was voted on yesterday: 
RepMeijer,@Zads77 I appreciate your good-faith initial question and regret I didn’t have an explanation up earlier.
RepMeijer,@VoteWooden Happy to explain: 
RepMeijer,@argueswithbots The moral hazard is rewarding an administrative agency for failing to do its job and support feeding the needy.
RepMeijer,Finally apart from not doing anything to solve current crisis HR 7790 would be rewarding an agency that is performing its mission poorly with more money without connecting the funds requested to better achieving the mission. The moral hazard is self-evident. (3/3)
RepMeijer,The formula shortage was due to bureaucratic dithering at FDA on reopening Abbott’s Sturgis facility and exacerbated by protectionist import policies + market inflexibility due to WIC single-source contracts. I voted in support of HR 7791 which addresses latter 2 issues. (2/3)
RepMeijer,Absolutely- I voted against HR 7790 bc it has no impact on the current crisis and reward bad agency behavior. This one-page bill is just a $28M increase for FDA salaries. That’s it. If baby formula shortage was caused by an underfunded FDA this would help. But it wasn’t. (1/3) 
RepMeijer,Fitting end to this farce: -Disinformation Governance Board paused-Nina Jankowicz has resigned
