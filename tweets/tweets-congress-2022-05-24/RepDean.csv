RepDean,You want to really be pro-life?Pass gun safety laws to protect children and families.I’m ready.@HouseDemocrats are ready.Where are the rest of our lawmakers?
RepDean,.@HouseDemocrats have passed bills to deal with our gun violence crisis.We passed two gun background check bills to close loopholes.Both are stuck in the *Senate*Tell ALL lawmakers — doing nothing is not a damn option.
RepDean,Our children are not safe ANYWHERE.I’m both heartbroken and honestly angry as we watch these tragedies continue to happen without substantive action.At this point I am pleading — what are we willing to do to stop these slaughters?When is enough enough? 
RepDean,Rain or shine — these kids know how to cruise into the weekend.Wishing everyone a relaxing weekend full of fun and love ❤️ 
RepDean,After a busy week in DC addressing the infant formula shortage and high gas prices I am now heading on a CODEL with @HouseForeign.Eager to work with this bipartisan group on the humanitarian crisis resulting from Russia’s invasion into Ukraine. 
RepDean,Today I voted for critical legislation to stop Big Oil from #RippingOffAmericans and help lower prices at the pump by:✅ Ending price gouging✅ Penalizing market manipulators✅ Bringing transparency to this secretive marketTheir profits show that this is necessary. 
RepDean,For 57 years @NatlHeadStart has provided critical support to 37 million children and their families across our nation.Thank you for helping generations of children succeed in school and life.#HappyBDayHeadStart!
RepDean,I know first-hand how essential infant formula is for families and I'm deeply concerned by the shortage.That's why I am voting with @HouseDemocrats to get the FDA the resources it needs to address this shortage and help prevent it from ever happening again.
RepDean,In our nation there are nearly two million living women veterans — and women make up the largest growing demographic of veterans.At the Military Women's Memorial the Bipartisan Women’s Caucus honored their immense service bravery and patriotism. 
RepDean,It was great to speak with @ScotGovFM @NicolaSturgeon about gender equality and equity.The battle for true equality for women is ongoing and I’m grateful for the First Minister’s likewise dedication to it.Look forward to future conversations with this great public servant.
