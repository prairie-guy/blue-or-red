RepJudyChu,Going to school. Going grocery shopping. Going to church. Going to the mall.My heart breaks for the families and community in Uvalde Texas—and for all victims of gun violence. We must do better. We must save lives. We must #EndGunViolence. 
RepJudyChu,Thank you @POTUS for acting quickly to ensure our families can provide safe nutritious formula for their children. This is going to make a world of difference for families in CA-27 and across our nation. 
RepJudyChu,It was an honor to join @NationalACE for #AAPIHeritageMonth—advocating on behalf of AAPI small businesses nationwide and celebrating strides forward such as the establishment of the Minority Business Development Agency and the signing of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law. 
RepJudyChu,Today we celebrate the tremendous life and legacy of Harvey Milk—the first openly gay man elected to public office in California and a trailblazer in the LGBTQ+ community.Milk’s legacy not only impacted San Francisco but a nation—inspiring the fight for a more just society. 
RepJudyChu,The Women’s Health Protection Act is not only going to ensure our right to decide &amp; enshrine Roe—it’s going to save lives.Thank you @SpeakerPelosi for your support &amp; quick action moving this critical bill to the floor in response to extremist abortion bans nationwide.
RepJudyChu,One year ago I was proud to stand alongside my colleagues as the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act was signed into law—marking an important first step taken as a nation to address the *339%* uptick in anti-AAPI violence since the onset of the pandemic.Today the work continues on. 
RepJudyChu,It's clear we need to lower costs for hardworking Californians and Americans—and @POTUS has the power to drive these costs down today by #CancellingStudentDebt lifting up to a $50000 weight off the shoulders of millions.Let's get this done. 
RepJudyChu,Last night after regular testing I tested positive for COVID-19.
