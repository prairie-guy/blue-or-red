RepJohnCurtis,Congress has worked to force accountability for these crimes and it is time for our partners around the globe to do the same.
RepJohnCurtis,As I am reading this new report containing some of the first-ever photographs from inside Xinjiang’s concentration camps I am reminded of the testimony I heard in 2019 by @ferkat_jawdat in front of a @HouseForeignGOP committee.  
RepJohnCurtis,I am sending this letter with @RepSherrill and others on both sides of the aisle putting Utahns first as we work on solutions to quickly resolve baby formula supply chain issues. Learn more: 
RepJohnCurtis,NEW: This week I intro'd a bill in the House requiring the Admin to report to Congress on their actions to solve the formula shortage. I appreciate the bipartisan desire to resolve this crisis and am hopeful to receive the information we need to prevent this from happening again.
RepJohnCurtis,Today on #ArmedForcesDay I am proud of all who have answered the call to serve and defend our Constitution. 
RepJohnCurtis,We now know the FDA was aware of this issue when it began but did not take the steps to prevent the shortage. Instead we need to work in a bipartisan fashion to find solutions that gets more formula on the shelves and prevent a situation like this from happening again.
RepJohnCurtis,They are sitting on a surplus of funds and throwing money at a federal agency won’t fix a supply chain problem in large part created by the FDA itself. 
RepJohnCurtis,Just two months ago the FDA received a $102 million budget increase including $11 million specifically for maternal and infant health and nutrition.
RepJohnCurtis,THREAD: This week the House passed a bill that would give the FDA $28 million extra in funding to address the formula shortage. I opposed this bill because not only is funding not an issue for them but it also distracts us from working on real solutions.  #utpol
RepJohnCurtis,As co-chair of the Congressional Olympic Caucus I’m pleased to see Utah become the temporary home for the Ukrainian curling team and other Ukrainian Olympic athletes coaches and family members thanks to this effort by the Utah Olympic Legacy Foundation. 
RepJohnCurtis,My thoughts on the House vote I took today about price gouging of gas. I believe we can have affordable and clean energy. Yet attacking American production while letting China and Russia off the hook won’t solve the global emissions problem we face. #utpol 
RepJohnCurtis,This is bad policy that will result in the export of American jobs and more carbon emissions. Let's utilize our domestic resources. #FlipTheSwitch
RepJohnCurtis,The Biden Administration has attacked American energy production on federal lands which created thousands of jobs in Utah in favor of importing from our foreign adversaries. America produces cleaner and more efficiently than anywhere in the world. 
RepJohnCurtis,The House has just passed this bill and it now awaits a signature from @POTUS. We were all saddened by the news of his passing in February and this bill is a simple way to honor his legacy in Utah. #utpol
