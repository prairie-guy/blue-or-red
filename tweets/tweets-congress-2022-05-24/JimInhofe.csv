JimInhofe,Please join Kay and me as we honor and celebrate those serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. More than 2 million men and women volunteer to serve and defend this great country every day. Today and every day we thank you and we salute you!#ArmedForcesDay 
JimInhofe,This is fantastic news. 1.4 million illegal immigrants escaped or released into the U.S. is NOT “operational control” of the border and lifting Title 42 would only make this crisis worse.
JimInhofe,One big consequence of the skyrocketing cost of food fuel and child care? Retaining service members becomes harder senior enlisted officers are telling Congress. President Biden must address record inflation before it permanently harms our force.
JimInhofe,Now that @POTUS has used the final $100m from the 1st Ukraine supplemental package he must sign the bill we just passed without delay &amp; get more weapons that will keep the Ukrainians in the fight ASAP like multiple launch rocket systems more howitzers and higher-end drones.
JimInhofe,"Ukraine faces a “prolonged” &amp; “escalatory"" conflict. It is in our best interest to support Ukraine now – making it less likely our sons &amp; daughters will have to fight a war against Russian aggression later. My full statement on today’s vote ↓"
JimInhofe,Let’s be clear: Supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia puts U.S. security interests first. We also need to be clear that for the last 17 months @POTUS could have done much more to deter Russia &amp; much less to appease Putin.  My op-ed in @TheHill↓
JimInhofe,This week during National Public Works Week we celebrate our past accomplishments in public works and look to the future. A future where we prioritize responsible bipartisan investment in real infrastructure and the men and women who work to sustain it every day. 
JimInhofe,Promising results from Air Force’s recent hypersonic missile test. However until we consistently provide @DeptofDefense with the real budget growth it needs China’s and Russia’s lead in hypersonic strike capabilities will only grow larger. #FY23NDAA
