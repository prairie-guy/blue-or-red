RepMcEachin,Since the start of 2022 there have been over 200 mass shootings in our country and countless lives lost. Enough is enough. We need to take steps to protect our children &amp; the American people. 
RepMcEachin,Heartbreaking news out of Texas. My prayers are with the Uvalde community the victims and their families.  We cannot allow this to be the norm. The Senate must vote on commonsense gun reform legislation to help curb this epidemic of gun violence in our nation. 
RepMcEachin,Our bill will deliver a $500 direct cash rebate paid for by eliminating 11 of the most egregious tax subsidies flowing to fossil fuel companies. This will help Americans financially ensure Big Oil pays its fair share &amp; support a clean energy future. 
RepMcEachin,Consumers are feeling pain at the pump while the fossil fuel industry enjoys record-breaking multi-billion-dollar profits. That's why I am proud to introduce the People Over Petroleum Act with @RepCasten &amp; @repblumenauer to help Americans during this tenuous period. 
RepMcEachin,I urge the Senate to take up a vote on the several pieces of gun reform legislation that have passed out of the House and are currently stalled and awaiting action. Americansâ€™ lives hang in the balance. We cannot afford further inaction. Read more here: 
RepMcEachin,As our country reels from the aftermath of several shootings the pressing need to advance gun reform legislation has become more apparent. The American people deserve to live free from the fear of mass shootings &amp; other horrific acts of domestic terrorism.
