SenatorBraun,Horrified by the senseless murder of 14 children and a teacher in Texas. My heart is with the parents and the community bearing this unimaginable anguish.
SenatorBraun,This is Hoosier Hospitality at its’ finest! I am proud to call Indiana home. 
SenatorBraun,95% of fentanyl in the United States is smuggled in through the open border.  The link between record high illegal immigration and the soaring rates of fentanyl overdose deaths is not a coincidence.  Let’s secure the border &amp; save American lives.
SenatorBraun,Today’s announcement is a big win for Indiana. This new battery plant in Kokomo from Stellantis and Samsung will create 1400 great careers for Hoosiers &amp; attract more economic activity to our state. Investment like this helps Indiana stay the manufacturing capital of America. 
SenatorBraun,Sally was a tremendous servant leader. I appreciated working with her in the state legislature. Her love for community and the state of Indiana was unmatched. Such sad news for her community and I’m praying for her friends and family.
SenatorBraun,The Biden HHS's proposal to surrender some U.S. sovereignty to the WHO is alarming. The WHO has no right to determine our health policy. It is Sec. Becerra’s duty to fight for our Constitution and sovereignty at the World Health Assembly. Americans will be watching!
SenatorBraun,The IRS is not working for Americans the way that it should. Throwing them more money ($80 billion to be exact) to audit harass and target taxpayers is not the answer.@taxreformer
SenatorBraun,Ending Title 42 would triple the number of crossings at the border and it’s sad that the courts had to step in to stop President Biden from plunging our border deeper into chaos. We must use every tool we have to stop the fentanyl pouring across our border and killing Hoosiers.
SenatorBraun,An activist NLRB does not help employees employers or taxpayers. 
SenatorBraun,"""'That’s one of the prices that Putin should pay. … The more the merrier that we get into NATO' said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) who was among the 11 conservatives who opposed the $40 billion Ukraine aid package due to the high price tag."""
SenatorBraun,We must take a stand for those who can't. #PromisingPathwaysAct @bsw5020 
SenatorBraun,My full statement on $40 billion Ukraine spending bill. 
SenatorBraun,Read my op-ed with @bsw5020 about the Promising Pathway Act - a bill that will get life-saving treatments into the hands of ALS patients who don't have time to wait. @statnews 
SenatorBraun,Thanks for having me @RepJimBanks. Our debt and inflation crisis hurts every American and poses a dire national security threat. Great conversation about SOLUTIONS with @RepublicanStudy
