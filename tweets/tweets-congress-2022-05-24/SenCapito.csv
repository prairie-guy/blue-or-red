SenCapito,Joined my colleagues to send a letter to @potus conveying our full support of Sweden &amp; Finland’s applications for NATO membership.Putin’s blind aggression toward Ukraine has only strengthened the NATO alliance as we stand together against his unjust war. 
SenCapito,The @DeptVetAffairs AIR Commission’s recommendations would cut health services at three of West Virginia’s four VAMCs. Our veterans deserve far better. That’s why I helped introduce legislation to stop these changes from taking effect: 
SenCapito,Moorefield my staff will be hosting a mobile office in your area tomorrow! Sign up here ➡  
SenCapito,Good luck to the student athletes of @PSCSoftballWV today as they compete in the NJCAA World Series! You all make our state so proud. 💙 💛🥎
SenCapito,May is #SkinCancerAwarenessMonth. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the U.S. but it is also one of the most preventable. Here are some resources West Virginians can use to reduce the risk of skin cancer for you and your family! 
SenCapito,Despite President Biden’s best efforts thankfully Title 42 is remaining in place for now.In the midst of the president’s border crisis our agents rely on this tool to do their job and keep our borders secure.Thanks for all you do @CBP!
SenCapito,Our police officers teachers and first responders always answer the call when help is needed and deserve our support. That’s why I joined @SenRubioPress on the HELPER Act which will assist in their efforts to own homes and stay in our communities. 
SenCapito,.@potus West Virginians are being forced to choose between filling up their car and putting food on their table. Let’s prioritize American energy so WV can get the relief it needs. 
SenCapito,🚨 My staff is hosting mobile offices in Hardy Mineral and Berkeley Counties this week! RSVP here and swing by! 
SenCapito,Your feedback is key in helping to close the #digitaldivide. Keep sharing your broadband stories with me here: 
SenCapito,These are just a few of the stories I’m hearing on the impact record high gas prices are having on West Virginians. We need action not political messaging and virtue signals from the White House. 
SenCapito,The U.S. is the most prosperous country in the world &amp; it’s unacceptable that our mothers can’t find baby formula at their local stores due to the current shortage.Americans deserve answers from @US_FDA &amp; @potus. I’m working on getting those answers. 
SenCapito,Wonderful news! Congratulations to @BlfdState on your achievement of university status! 
SenCapito,As I have said repeatedly lifting Title 42 would be devastating to our country’s borders. Following record high encounters in April I’m glad a court has halted this action. I’ll continue to stand for policies that keep our borders protected— not porous. 
SenCapito,Participated in Highland Hospital’s Mental Health Awareness Walk at Power Park today to help bring awareness to mental health issues and available services right here in West Virginia. 
SenCapito,ICYMI: Earlier this week I announced that $26 million is coming to West Virginia to help reclaim abandoned mine lands and revitalize our communities. DETAILS:

SenCapito,Like many families in West Virginia I know the devastating impact that Alzheimer’s disease and dementia can have on families and loved ones. I will continue to build off the progress we have made until we find a cure. 
SenCapito,This is another step the Senate is taking to help alleviate this terrible shortage in baby formula. Proud to co-sponsor this legislation to provide flexibility in the WIC program to support mothers and families in WV. 
SenCapito,Gas prices are at record highs across the US. Americans are having to make tough choices about where to spend their money.Meanwhile @potus is developing a “social cost of carbon” behind closed doors that would be used to make energy even more expensive. 
SenCapito,Happening today! Don’t forget to RSVP:  
SenCapito,Mothers across WV have reached out to me and my office about baby formula shortages. This is a life or death issue and @US_FDA and the Biden administration need to take responsibility. @RogerMarshallMD and I are demanding answers and accountability.  
SenCapito,Congratulations to Parkersburg High School on winning the first ever @WVSSAC state championship in robotics! I loved seeing the competition live and can’t wait for this tradition to continue in WV. 
SenCapito,Folks in the energy industry have been doing a lot to reduce emissions.Why doesn’t @EPA hold up their end of the bargain?The future of our country depends on American energy production and they need a seat at the table. 
SenCapito,President Biden claimed that the buck would stop with him when he entered the White House.Now that gas prices are at record highs across the country his tone has changed. 
SenCapito,High gas prices are hurting working West Virginians.Here’s just one example I recently heard back home: 
SenCapito,Sky-high gas prices are hurting West Virginians. I’ll be discussing this in more details with my @SenateGOP colleagues shortly ⬇️ 
SenCapito,Two weeks ago I recommended that @DHSgov drop the idea of a Disinformation Board policing the free speech of Americans. Word that this ludicrous Orwellian idea has been put on pause is good news for ALL Americans. 
SenCapito,HAPPENING SOON: Join us for a hearing on the proposed 2023 Budget of @USFWS. Watch live @ 10AM here: 
SenCapito,Petersburg you’re up next! Swing by my mobile office tomorrow at 11:30 a.m. SIGN UP HERE:  
SenCapito,This is an issue I've continued to work on including introducing the Equal Pay for Team USA Act last summer with @SenatorCantwell. Congratulations @USWNT! 
SenCapito,Fantastic news! It's only right that the women competing for the United States in global athletic competitions receive the same pay and benefits as their male counterparts 🇺🇸
