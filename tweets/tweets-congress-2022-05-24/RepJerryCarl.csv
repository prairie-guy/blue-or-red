RepJerryCarl,Tina and I just voted! Have you? 
RepJerryCarl,This is the same border that Secretary Mayorkas said is being “effectively managed.” He should be impeached for failing to do his job. 
RepJerryCarl,How out of touch can you be? Most Americans can’t afford to put gas in their car and groceries on the table. Inflation isn’t just a “high class problem.” 
RepJerryCarl,On this #ArmedForcesDay we pause to honor the many brave men and women who defend our nation at home and abroad. Thank you for your service! 🇺🇸🇺🇸 
RepJerryCarl,Good news! The Biden admin has stopped plans to create its ridiculous Disinformation Governance Board. A major win for freedom of speech!
