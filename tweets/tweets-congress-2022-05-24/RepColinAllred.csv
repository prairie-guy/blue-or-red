RepColinAllred,In Uvalde another senseless act of gun violence has taken innocent lives including at least 14 children and one teacher. My heart breaks for our fellow Texans and I'm praying for those going through unimaginable pain. It doesn't have to be this way.
RepColinAllred,Today I held a virtual roundtable on the formula crisis with folks from @NFP_nursefamily and Dr. Morse from @UTSWNews. This is a tough time for families and I am doing all I can in Congress to work alongside @POTUS to get formula back on shelves. Watch: 
RepColinAllred,Hey folks I am hosting a telephone town hall tomorrow on May 25 at 12:30 PM. If you were having issues signing up please try again by clicking here: I look forward to sharing an update on my work in Congress and talking with North Texans tomorrow. 
RepColinAllred,Ukraine's brave resistance is an inspiration. We must stay steadfast in helping Ukraine and ensuring Taiwan can continue to govern itself and contribute to the world without fear of a Chinese invasion.As I said in February their fight is our fight. 
RepColinAllred,My mom was a teacher and we must do all we can to help anyone who wants to be a teacher get the training they need. I support getting @DallasCollegeTX funding to do just that and I am glad to see progress on this in Richardson.
RepColinAllred,North Texas is in for a hot summer and it's critical folks have AC in their homes to combat the heat and stay safe. I encourage all eligible residents to take advantage of this program providing free AC units to Dallas County homes.
RepColinAllred,I know many North Texas families are worried about high costs due to inflation &amp; shortages. That’s why I'm working hard in Congress to address these challenges but I also want to hear from you. Join my telephone town hall this Wed. May 25 @ 12:30 PM. RSVP:  
RepColinAllred,No matter what sanctions Putin pursues on me my colleagues or any American who stands with the Ukrainians and their fight for their democracy – nothing will undo the damage Putin has done to Russia and its people through his unjustified war. 
RepColinAllred,As a dad I know how stressful it is when you can’t get what your baby needs. That’s why last week I voted for emergency help to fix the formula shortage. If you’re a parent in need I urge you to visit @HHSgov’s website for formula resources. 
RepColinAllred,Congratulations to the class of 2022! You should be so proud of all the accomplishments you’ve made. Now what’s next? Registering to vote. You have the power to shape your future and make your voice heard in our democracy. 
RepColinAllred,With all of life’s stresses it can be tough to prioritize your mental health. May is #MentalHealthMonth and I urge folks in need to take advantage of the resources available including reaching out to @NTBHA6’s mental health support line at 866-260-8000. You are not alone.
RepColinAllred,With this resolution I’m urging Congress to stand united in demanding the Russian Federation release Brittney Griner. Let’s bring her home.
RepColinAllred,Happy #ArmedForcesDay to all of our active duty service members and their families. I am grateful for your tremendous sacrifice and I’m so thankful for your commitment and dedication to protecting our country. 
RepColinAllred,Today marks the 103rd anniversary of the House passing the 19th Amendment which led to women finally gaining the right to vote. The work continues today to safeguard this right and I will always fight for access to the ballot box for every American. 
RepColinAllred,I voted for the American Rescue Plan to create the Emergency Connectivity Fund and close the digital divide for our students. Now the @FCC is committing an additional $30 million+ to help @dallasschools ensure our kids can stay connected to their classrooms. 
RepColinAllred,No parent buying formula right now should be a victim of price gouging. That's why I led my colleagues in urging the Texas Attorney General to use the full weight of the office to crack down on price gouging of baby formula and investigate bad actors. 
RepColinAllred,Temperatures are rising and as we reach the summer months I recommend North Texans follow these conservation tips. But overall Texans need our electric grid to be reliable and state leaders in Austin need to fix it so this doesn’t keep happening. 
RepColinAllred,Brittney Griner should be home with her family and @WNBA teammates but she’s still detained in Russia. I am proud to help lead this resolution demanding her immediate release so we can get Brittney back to her loved ones and back on the court with @PhoenixMercury. 
RepColinAllred,I assembled a nonpartisan committee of North Texas leaders to help recommend projects. I thank them for working to put the needs of North Texas first and I look forward to working to get these job-creating projects approved and signed into law.
RepColinAllred,When North Texans work together we can do big things and that’s why I was proud to again assemble a committee of North Texas leaders to recommend these Community Project Funding submissions. 
RepColinAllred,When any American is held abroad every day is a lifetime. That is especially true in Russia and it's why I am proud to lead this resolution with @RepGregStanton and @JacksonLeeTX18 demanding the Russian Federation release Brittney Griner. 
RepColinAllred,With technological advances in medicine and through the COVID-19 pandemic Taiwan has made considerable contributions to global health. I applaud @POTUS for reiterating US support to restore Taiwan’s observer status at the World Health Assembly. 
RepColinAllred,This formula shortage will take a whole government approach to solve both the short-term formula crisis and longer-term supply chain issues. I’ll keep working in Congress to address this crisis and help families in this difficult time.
RepColinAllred,No parent should have to worry about how they are going to feed their child. That's why the House is taking action tonight to expand formula options for parents using WIC and give the FDA resources to address this crisis. 
RepColinAllred,Addressing this crisis quickly will take every tool we have and I support this action from @POTUS to invoke the Defense Production Act and use military aircraft to import formula from abroad.
RepColinAllred,This has bipartisan support and it can and should come to North Texas.This would stand up a new federal research initiative to leverage federal dollars to help researchers in North Texas and across America lead the world in groundbreaking life-saving health care research. 
RepColinAllred,Happy birthday Head Start! Since the enactment of the Head Start Act 57 years ago today this program has made an impact on children across the country. Thank you to all Head Start teachers and staff for going above and beyond for families in our communities. 
RepColinAllred,When I visited Afghanistan and Kuwait in 2019 I heard firsthand the harmful effects of toxic burn pits on our service members. I applaud this bipartisan agreement to get veterans the care they need and look forward to working to get this done. 
RepColinAllred,With Finland and Sweden’s applications to NATO now official this shows Putin’s war is a strategic failure. Together NATO nations will be able to bolster efforts to stabilize the region and fight against authoritarianism. 
RepColinAllred,Our vets deserve quality care but aging facilities are impeding the VA’s ability to deliver. I’m proud my bipartisan bill w/ @RepJakeEllzey to invest in facilities in Texas &amp; across the country passed the House. W/ it we're keeping our promise to our vets.
RepColinAllred,The kind of hate against Asian Americans that fueled this crime has no place in our North Texas community. It is so important that justice is done I am glad to see swift action in this investigation. 
RepColinAllred,This attack in Dallas’ Koreatown is horrifying and part of a rising trend of attacks on our AAPI neighbors. I hope the perpetrator is brought to justice and that we come together to defeat this hatred against the AAPI community.
