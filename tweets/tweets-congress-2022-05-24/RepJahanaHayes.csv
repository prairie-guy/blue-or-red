RepJahanaHayes,Since the onset of the baby formula shortage I have been steadfast in my commitment to finding a solution. My bipartisan Access to Baby Formula Act will ensure flexibility so we can help WIC participants access formula from other companies 
RepJahanaHayes,This crisis was caused by the simultaneous manufacturing recall at Abbott Nutrition and ongoing pandemic related supply chain issues. WIC families are impacted the hardest as Abbott formula serves 89% of all infants participating in WIC.
RepJahanaHayes,Among the most vulnerable are mothers and babies enrolled in the WIC program who use formula at roughly double the rate of non-participating families – disproportionally impacting communities and families with the highest need.
RepJahanaHayes,Families lucky enough to find formula in their local stores the prices they are paying have increased dramatically in some cases rising 18% over the past year.
RepJahanaHayes,In #CT05 parents have joined FB groups to track where they can find formula. They’re waiting in lines outside of stores buying sample packs on the streets even resorting to the dangerous practice of watering down their formula just to stretch their supply. They are desperate.
RepJahanaHayes,Now mothers across our country are feeling the desperation guilt and anxiety of not being able to adequately feed their babies during the most critical time in their development.
RepJahanaHayes,🧵We are in the midst of a national emergency where families are panicking as they work to prevent their babies from going hungry. Since April around 40% of formula products were out of stock in 7 states – including my home state of Connecticut.
RepJahanaHayes,🚨BREAKING: The House just passed the Workforce Innovation &amp; Opportunity Act which includes my bill to invest in youth job training &amp; provide vulnerable youth the supports to reach their full potential. Read more on the historic $78B bill package here:
