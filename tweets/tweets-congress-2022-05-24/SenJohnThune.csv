SenJohnThune,Walking down memory lane in Murdo today. From flipping burgers at the Star Family Diner to shooting hoops with my dad I have so many great memories here. There’s nothing quite like your hometown. 
SenJohnThune,There can never be too many partners in the quest to preserve peace &amp; maintain a strong defense against tyranny. We should welcome any nation that seeks to help further these goals. Sweden &amp; Finland will offer valuable geopolitical &amp; strategic contributions to the #NATO alliance.
SenJohnThune,An impressive group of students from @USD stopped by my Capitol office today with their professor @Tom_Mroz. They had great questions about my work as South Dakota’s senator. 
SenJohnThune,The border crisis clearly began when President Biden took office. If he ends Title 42 policies next week we’re going to need a much taller chart. 
SenJohnThune,Always interested in hearing about the issues the @SiouxlndChamber is tracking and it was great to see so many familiar faces at the Capitol today. I was glad to discuss my efforts to support our region’s economy
