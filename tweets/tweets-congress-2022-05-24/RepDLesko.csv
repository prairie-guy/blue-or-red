RepDLesko,President Biden is considering tapping into our nation‚Äôs emergency fuel reserves to slap a shortsighted temporary Band-Aid on the soaring diesel prices his anti-energy policies have caused. 
RepDLesko,"Note to the Biden Administration: Concerned parents are NOT domestic terrorists!""Early demands from the National School Boards Association to the White House included calling for the deployment of the Army National Guard &amp; the military police to monitor school board meetings.‚Äù "
RepDLesko,The U.S. sends $400-$500 MILLION each year to the World Health Organization (WHO). My @freedomcaucus colleagues and I are calling on the Biden Administration to WITHDRAW from the WHO or demand that the WHO takes action to combat its corruption.
RepDLesko,The #BidenBorderCrisis poses a serious risk to the safety of Americans across our nation. It is imperative that action is taken to secure our borders. It only takes ONE criminal making it across our border illegally to wreak havoc on our nation. 
RepDLesko,It‚Äôs simple: We cannot let people cross into our nation without knowing who they are or why they are here. Our immigration laws must be respected. 
RepDLesko,A federal judge‚Äôs decision to block the Biden Administration from lifting Title 42 is a win for Arizona border towns and Americans across our nation. We must keep fighting to fully secure our border and enforce our immigration laws! 
RepDLesko,I had a wonderful time at the @DAAUSA Summit discussing digital advertising and data privacy. #DAASummit22 
RepDLesko,Congratulations to #AZ08‚Äôs own @VVHS_MONSOON on ranking 4th in the nation in the @SIFMAFoundation's 2022 #CapitolHillChallenge! Great job! Last month I had a great time speaking with these bright students about my work in Congress as well as the importance of financial literacy! 
RepDLesko,MUST READ: I am proud to introduce the Women‚Äôs Bill of Rights to ensure that we uphold biological women‚Äôs rights and place in society. This bill also ensures that we are protected under the law! 
RepDLesko,In President Biden‚Äôs economy Americans are left with less money at the end of each month and are forced to make sacrifices in order to make ends meet. Americans deserve better than this. 
RepDLesko,The American people know that President Biden is to blame for the slew of crises that they are facing. As a result of his poor leadership Biden‚Äôs approval ratings are at a historic low. 
RepDLesko,High fuel costs are putting a strain on our nation‚Äôs families and farmers. We must increase domestic energy production and utilize our nation‚Äôs resources. 
RepDLesko,Austin from our office enjoyed doing a ride along with the Sun City West Posse. He learned about all they do to serve our community.

RepDLesko,‚õΩÔ∏è American households are now spending an estimated $5000 A YEAR on gasoline alone. ‚õΩÔ∏èThis is up from about $2800 a year ago and is a direct result of the Biden Administration‚Äôs assault on American energy. 
RepDLesko,In order to get the #BidenBorderCrisis under control we must:‚úîÔ∏è Finish the wall.‚úîÔ∏è Hire more Border Patrol agents.‚úîÔ∏è Enforce our immigration laws.‚úîÔ∏è Get rid of policies that encourage illegal immigration.‚úîÔ∏è Keep Title 42.
RepDLesko,Americans are projected to pay over $5 a gallon for gas this summer. #BuildBackBroke
RepDLesko,Under the Biden Administration everything either costs more or is out of stock. 
RepDLesko,Did you know that at 4 weeks babies begin to develop their heart and brain tissue? READ my op-ed on @FoxNews on facts that the abortion industry DOESN‚ÄôT want you to know. ‚¨áÔ∏è 
RepDLesko,Today the price for a gallon of gas hit a new all-time high for the 10th straight day in a row. They have broken the records every day for 10 days in a row now.
RepDLesko,Gas prices are projected to be at a record-high for Memorial Day travel! We must flip the switch on American energy and reverse the damage that President Biden and the Democrats have caused. 
RepDLesko,Americans across the country could soon be facing $6 gas prices. This is a direct result of President Biden and the Democrats‚Äô failed policies! 
RepDLesko,I launched the Congressional Caucus to Protect Kids to PROTECT children from the Dems‚Äô agenda of sexualizing our children in schools health care government programs and online. 
RepDLesko,Arizonans cannot afford Democrat policies! 
RepDLesko,Instead of taking responsibility for the #BidenGasHike President Biden has placed the blame on the pandemic Putin &amp; now mom &amp; pop gas stations. Americans know that Biden‚Äôs anti-energy policies are to blame for the surge in gas prices! Watch my remarks on the House Floor below: 
RepDLesko,Ridiculous! #BidenGasHike 
RepDLesko,REMINDER: We are days away from Title 42 being lifted! Once lifted the border crisis will only get worse.Border security is national security!

RepDLesko,I joined @RepArmstrongND's letter to CDC Director Walensky to demand answers about the CDC‚Äôs legal authority to obtain Americans‚Äô location data. This violates the rights of Americans!

RepDLesko,The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve has dropped to its lowest levels since 1987. Maybe if the Biden Administration didn‚Äôt tap into the Reserve to put a Band-Aid on the energy crisis he caused this wouldn‚Äôt have happened!
