RepPressley,Our broken status quo is failing the disability community especially those with #LongCOVID. That won't change until we recognize that disability rights are human rights and that every policy is a disability policy. 
RepPressley,Student debt cancellation would allow borrowers to: —buy a home —grow their families —start a business—save for the future —reinvest in the economy—&amp; so much more@POTUS must #CancelStudentDebt.

RepPressley,We need to #EndMassIncarceration &amp; fixing our clemency process is a central part of the solution.My #FIXClemency Act would help us address the massive clemency backlog and help our communities find healing. 
RepPressley,We need @POTUS to #CancelStudentDebt so we can boost our economy and reduce the racial wealth gap.Black Americans need this relief and I'm glad @RepBeatty &amp; @TheBlackCaucus are calling on the President to act.
RepPressley,#LongCOVID is a crisis-within-a-crisis that we can't ignore any longer.We must support our #LongHaulers by investing in research collecting better data and passing my bill to #TREATLongCOVID.

RepPressley,Student debt cancellation is a kitchen table issue that is personal for so many Black families across America.@POTUS can #CancelStudentDebt and single-handedly transform the lives of millions. He must act without delay. 
RepPressley,Overturning Roe v. Wade would only perpetuate cycles of poverty &amp; trap our most vulnerable in systems of oppression.In a nation with a history of medical apartheid against Black brown immigrant Indigenous and disabled folks—none of this is abstract.
RepPressley,The recently-recalled Similac baby formula is the exclusive brand for MA families on WIC—making it nearly impossible for them to find formula.We need @AbbottNews to explain when parents in the Commonwealth can expect to see Similac on store shelves.
RepPressley,Title 42 was always about stoking xenophobic hate and inflicting harm on Black and brown migrants.It must not be allowed to stand and I'm glad the Biden Administration is appealing this cruel ruling.

RepPressley,Proud to be a member of this historic @TheBlackCaucus and deeply grateful the CBC is joining our calls for @POTUS to #CancelStudentDebt.This is a racial economic and kitchen table issue for Black families and the President must act without delay. 
RepPressley,Congress created our broken &amp; unjust clemency process and now it's time for Congress to fix it. With over 17000 clemency applications pending we must pass my #FIXClemency Act so we can help #EndMassIncarceration and set our communities on a pathway to healing. 
RepPressley,Thank you @POTUS for heeding our calls to use the Defense Production Act to address the nationwide baby formula shortage.This will provide a critical lifeline for millions of families and we must continue using every federal tool available to confront this crisis. 
RepPressley,Happy #HaitianFlagDay! Today marks 1 year since we revived the House Haiti Caucus to center voices from Haiti in our foreign policy.#MA7 is home to one of the largest Haitian communities &amp; I'm so grateful for the contributions of Haitian Americans to Massachusetts &amp; our nation. 
RepPressley,There are over 17000 federal clemency applications pending—that means over 17000 lives hanging in the balance.The US Pardon Attorney must release demographic data on the clemency backlog so we can better understand this problem and address its impacts. 
RepPressley,.@POTUS has been fighting hard to address the baby formula crisis &amp; we must keep it up.That's why myself @RepBowman @RepJayapal &amp; @RepGraceMeng are urging him to use every executive authority to end the shortage &amp; help feed our babies including the Defense Production Act.
