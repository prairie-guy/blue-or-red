RepPeteStauber,We should remember the words of the late Rep. Oberstar- ‚ÄúI urge you not to trade off the lifestyles livelihoods &amp; legitimate desires of the people of NE MN for equitable treatment in favor of the vague &amp; ill-defined interests of other constituencies far removed from the BWCA.‚Äù 
RepPeteStauber,@NatResources Read my full opening remarks here: 
RepPeteStauber,Tune in NOW for the @NatResources hearing about the Democrat-led permanent anti-mining bill that threatens our northern Minnesota way of life. I look forward to debunking misinformation and providing the truth about mining in MN. 
RepPeteStauber,It was a pleasure meeting with students this morning at Cambridge Christian School &amp; answering the questions they had about Congress. Thank you to the entire class for such a warm welcome and go Warriors! 
RepPeteStauber,Tomorrow at a @NatResources hearing I‚Äôll be speaking against a Democrat-led permanent anti-mining bill that threatens our northern Minnesota way of life. Mining is a path to a brighter future and the Iron Range will lead it. Read my op-ed here: 
RepPeteStauber,Join me tonight for another Telephone Townhall! At 6:00 PM Central I will be answering questions about the most pressing issues facing Minnesota‚Äôs Eighth Congressional District and our nation. To join the call use the dial-in information below. 
RepPeteStauber,Today we honor and thank all of the brave men and women who serve and protect our country. #ArmedForcesDay 
RepPeteStauber,It was an honor to attend the USS Minneapolis Saint Paul commissioning. The ship was built with steel made from northern Minnesota iron ore &amp; continues the Northland‚Äôs contribution to US national defense dating back to the World Wars. The ship &amp; her crew will serve with honor! üá∫üá∏ 
RepPeteStauber,234088 illegal immigrants crossed our southern border in April with Title 42 still in place. For reference as of 2020 the city of Duluth has nearly 86000 residents. Americans are fed up with Biden turning a blind eye to his self-inflicted border crisis.
RepPeteStauber,Pleased to see that as of this week Biden‚Äôs Ministry of Truth has been suspended. Our First Amendment is not up for grabs and having a government official as the arbiter of truth is dangerous &amp; downright unAmerican.
RepPeteStauber,Make no mistake: the rise in gas prices is the fault of Joe Biden‚Äôs decision to ban oil &amp; gas development. The legislation I voted against today is a distraction that does nothing to help Americans afford their lives. Instead we should support American energy.
RepPeteStauber,Happy 165th birthday Duluth! It is such an honor to represent such a beautiful city &amp; all of its hardworking people. 
RepPeteStauber,House Democrats are putting up a bill tonight to throw more money at the same FDA that has already failed parents with the baby formula shortage. We need real reforms and accountability not more blank checks for failed policies.
RepPeteStauber,Law enforcement agencies across the country are suffering from staffing shortages as a consequence of the defund &amp; disparage the police movement. We Republicans just offered a bill to improve recruitment &amp; retention of officers but Democrats voted NO. This is unacceptable.
RepPeteStauber,Our nation's energy crisis is happening due to President Biden's blatantly anti-energy agenda. Since taking office he has:-Canceled Keystone XL-Drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve-Revoked permits for critical mineral projects-Emboldened Putin with Nord Stream 2
RepPeteStauber,Yes we will Tom! 
RepPeteStauber,One year ago the average price per gallon of gas was $2.84. One month ago it was $3.83. Today in Minnesota the average price per gallon is $4.12. Biden's Pain at the Pump is hurting us all and Republicans stand ready with meaningful solutions for American families.
