RepMoBrooks,The @WHO's new abortion guidelines are horrible. To show my disgust I cosigned @RepDLamborn and @SenMikeLee's letter to the W.H.O. demanding they retract these dangerous guidelines. 
RepMoBrooks,Finland and Sweden have submitted applications to join NATO. I signed onto @RepMikeTurner's letter supporting their decision and encourage expedience in this process. 
RepMoBrooks,Instead of increasing competitiveness with China by prioritizing domestic workers the COMPETES Act focuses on importing foreign workers to take American jobs. My colleagues &amp; I are calling on House &amp; Senate leadership to remove these harmful provisions.
