RepMaloney,If guns made us safer America would be the safest nation in the world. Instead children in school customers at grocery stores and members in their places of worship are regularly terrorized by gun violence unparalleled in the developed world.
RepMaloney,14 children and 1 teacher in Texas. 15 lives taken away too early not by an act of nature but the predictable result of inaction on the thousands of shootings before it.We need to break the NRA's grip on Congress ‚Äî we need to stop moving on after every shooting.

RepMaloney,Debt collectors should never be able to harass people or use ‚Äúsmear tactics‚Äù to go after the friends and family of those in debt. I applaud the CFPB and @NewYorkStateAG for protecting consumers and penalizing predatory companies violating the law.  
RepMaloney,Active shooting incidents rose by over 50% last year. This is unacceptable! We need to pass gun safety legislation including my NICS Review Act which would improve our background check system and keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. 
RepMaloney,Honored to join Israeli Def. Minister Benny Gantz yesterday at Park East Synagogue to address the rise of civilian victims of terrorism in Israel the uptick of antisemitism in the U.S. and abroad and how to create meaningful solutions to both problems.

RepMaloney,Thrilled to see @POTUS is now using the Defense Production Act to get more formula back on the shelves as soon as possible. As a mother I know that this is a crisis for each family that needs formula and cannot find it. I am committed to seeing this shortage ends! 
RepMaloney,ATTN NYC Parents: Make sure your kiddos are boosted for #COVID19. It will protect YOU and our fellow NYers.

RepMaloney,Today marks the 13th anniversary of my Credit Cardholders‚Äô Bill of Rights becoming law.Every year it saves consumers BILLIONS. Now it‚Äôs time for Congress to pass my Overdraft Protection Act to protect Americans from predatory overdraft fees and keep more money in their pockets.

RepMaloney,Headed to the House floor to vote for additional funding to address the formula shortage. Cannot believe Republican leadership is whipping against this bill. Rs should stop playing politics with America‚Äôs families and work with Dems to get babies the formula they need.

RepMaloney,The report released today makes clear that @YVindman experienced significant reprisal for making protected disclosures through appropriate channels. The Senate must pass whistleblower reforms already taken up by the House ‚Äì because all whistleblowers deserve to be protected.
