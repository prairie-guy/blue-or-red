MartinHeinrich,In what world is it okay to have this shooting AFTER Buffalo and see nothing change.Answer: None#EndTheFilibuster 
MartinHeinrich,This is huge news. Between the funding I secured last year and this contract BlueHalo’s capabilities continue to dramatically grow—and with it New Mexico’s continued role as a leading state for all things Space. 
MartinHeinrich,The U.S. Commerce Department’s solar tariff investigation is crushing the clean energy industry clean energy jobs and the speed of our clean energy transition.  This investigation needs to come to a close.
MartinHeinrich,This has been a shared sentiment from the firefighters and incident management teams I’ve spoken with these past few weeks. I’m grateful to all the crews first responders and volunteers working day and night to hold these lines and care for evacuees.
MartinHeinrich,I was proud to cosponsor the Access to Baby Formula Act last week and glad to see President Biden sign this into law today. This along with Operation Fly Formula will help get much needed formula into the hands of parents.
MartinHeinrich,These horsepower and torque specs are crazy! My current truck is internal combustion but it looks like it may be the last ICE vehicle I ever own.
MartinHeinrich,Electric cars heat pumps and electric stoves can be big investments. But you don’t need to spend a lot of money to make use of more electric options. Here’s what we’re doing to cut down on fossil gas in our home until we can make the switch to an induction stove. 
MartinHeinrich,I appreciate the leadership of Regional Forester Michiko Martin the USFS and ABQ Open Space for thinking through ways to keep our communities safe in New Mexico while also ensuring access to our public lands to recreate responsibly during this horrible fire season.
MartinHeinrich,The Calf Canyon/Hermit’s Peak Fire has burned an area bigger than New York City.Unprecedented windy conditions from the West’s driest decades in 1200 years are to blame.This is exactly the devastating weather climate scientists have been warning us about for decades.
MartinHeinrich,The climate crisis is permanently changing the severity of our fire season in New Mexico. We need to change with it. 
MartinHeinrich,It's been years now since my boys were infants but I remember what it’s like to worry about making sure they are healthy and fed. I’m proud to be a cosponsor of the Access to Baby Formula Act and glad to see it heading to President Biden’s desk to bring NM families some relief.
MartinHeinrich,Even with these historic winds containment on the Cerro Pelado Fire has gone up to 74%. That's a massive accomplishment and a real testament to how hard the firefighters have been working. So grateful to everyone on the front lines of all these fires. 
MartinHeinrich,This bipartisan agreement is a renewed commitment to our veterans. All those living with chronic conditions from their exposure to toxins during their time in uniform deserve proper health care and benefits. Let’s get this on President Biden’s desk ASAP.
MartinHeinrich,I joined my colleagues in a letter to President Biden urging him to appoint a national coordinator for the infant formula shortage. We need a clear plan and all hands on deck to address this crisis. The President’s use of the Defense Production Act is a welcome part of this.
MartinHeinrich,Happy Birthday to @NatlHeadStart! For 57 years these programs have lifted up generations of children and families. It's long past time we put our NM Permanent Fund to work for early childhood education programs like these. Investing in American families will always pay off. 
MartinHeinrich,We have to get federal agencies back to in-person operations. Many are still without broadband &amp; need to be able to visit federal offices in person. We can’t let New Mexicans—especially seniors &amp; veterans—struggle to access Social Security Medicare or other essential benefits. 
MartinHeinrich,We’re in the middle of the the driest decade in 1200 years in the West. Climate change is the reason our fire season started so early and why it is so devastating.
MartinHeinrich,We absolutely need to take precautions to prevent wildfires but blanket closures of our public lands are not the answer. We need a nuanced approach that distinguishes between hiking on a trail versus lighting a campfire. We can balance safety &amp; access with a little common sense.
