RepBarbaraLee,Title 42 is not “border management.” It is a humanitarian disaster driven by racist xenophobic rhetoric that will get this country nowhere.
RepBarbaraLee,"A doctor AND sitting US Senator felt comfortable saying that maternal mortality rates were only bad ""if you count Black women.""Don't tell me there isn’t systemic racism in our health care system."
RepBarbaraLee,“Hope will never be silent.” Harvey Milk California’s first openly gay public official &amp; courageous advocate for the LGBTQ+ community would have turned 92 today had he not been assassinated in 1978. Let’s keep fighting for the equal &amp; just world he imagined. #HarveyMilkDay 
RepBarbaraLee,You know things are bad when legions of scientists are willing to lose their jobs or get arrested attempting to get leaders to act on climate.Bold climate legislation is needed NOW.
RepBarbaraLee,Abolish the Jim Crow filibuster. Codify Roe. Pass commonsense gun reform.In other words: protect Black bodies.
RepBarbaraLee,We aren’t even halfway through the year and this country has already had 200+ mass shootings.This. Is. Not. Normal.When will the “pro-life” party take responsibility for enabling mass murder?
RepBarbaraLee,I applaud @POTUS for hearing our call and swiftly invoking the Defense Production Act to address the infant formula shortage emergency.It is imperative that we never repeat such a crisis. 
RepBarbaraLee,A huge hard-fought win for #USWMT and the entire labor movement.This didn’t happen overnight. It happened thanks to years of courage dedication and fierce advocacy by @mPinoe &amp; countless others.Now let's ensure equal pay for equal (or superior😉) work in every industry. 
RepBarbaraLee,Proud to support @RepThompson’s efforts to secure this critical funding for CA producers &amp; growers impacted by wildfires &amp; natural disasters.
