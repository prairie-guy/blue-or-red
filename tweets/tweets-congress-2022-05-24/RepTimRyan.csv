RepTimRyan,Andrea and I are praying for the Uvalde community and the innocent young lives taken from us in another senseless tragedy.Our babies are being killed by gun violence and we are failing them. We have to do something.
RepTimRyan,Sometimes we overcomplicate things. We need to get back to the basics with our kids. Sleep. Balanced diet. Exercise and playtime. Limit screen time.When we invest in our kids we invest in our future.
RepTimRyan,A sanction from Putin for standing up against a blatant assault on freedom is a badge of honor.
RepTimRyan,Working class tax cut. Right now. 
RepTimRyan,From his service in Vietnam to his lifelong dedication to fighting for veterans' health care Carl Nunziato is a true American hero and represents the very best of Ohio. Couldn't be prouder that we have officially renamed Youngstown's VA facility the Carl Nunziato VA Clinic. 
RepTimRyan,I’m fighting for the families in Piketon that have been failed by a broken system.We can’t move forward unless we properly address the wrongdoings of the past and reinvest in this community after years of service to our nation.
RepTimRyan,Honored to be on the new list of Americans banned from Russia. Turns out Vladimir Putin doesn’t like it when you stand up for freedom and make him pay for murdering innocent people. Can’t say I’m surprised. Bullies are predictable.Proud to #StandWithUkraine.
RepTimRyan,Huge achievement for the city of Akron. This investment will create good-paying jobs expand job and skills training and attract new investment in our community. Proud to have partners in @Bounce_Hub to help bring these federal dollars home.
RepTimRyan,Ohio strong. Pro freedom. Pro democracy. Pro Ukraine. So proud to call @ajfutey a friend. This is leadership folks. 
RepTimRyan,This Armed Forces Day we thank all who have served the United States in uniform with honor. Our service members and their families are the heart and soul of America’s defense. 
RepTimRyan,For the first time since 1976 The United States’ annual economic growth is set to outpace China’s.Let’s keep this momentum going by continuing to invest in domestic manufacturing training our workforce for the future and developing new technologies here at home. 
RepTimRyan,The work this community provided to win the Cold War and the sacrifices made by Pike County residents must be repaid. I will continue to fight to clean up and redevelop the Plant and push the federal government to get this done once and for all.
RepTimRyan,Very important discussion today with plant workers and community leaders along with @RepMarcyKaptur about concerns related to the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon.Our work to deliver justice to Pike County is far from over. 
RepTimRyan,During #EMSWeek we recognize and celebrate the amazing EMS workers for their dedication and endless sacrifices to our communities. Thank you for all you do. 
RepTimRyan,These WWII Army Rangers put their lives on the line for our country. I’m proud to have helped get this award across the finish line in Congress to honor their heroic sacrifices and bravery in the fight for freedom.
RepTimRyan,The right call.The proposed power line would have undone years of progress in the area. Glad to see the Board listen to our community who spoke out against this plan. 
RepTimRyan,Our law enforcement officers go through hell to keep us safe and they deserve our support in return. I was proud to help pass a bill this week to give first responders and their families the mental health resources and support they deserve. 
RepTimRyan,I wrote a letter to the Ohio Power Siting Board in April opposing the plan. Building a 6 mile long power line through downtown Youngstown would be a major eyesore and risks undoing much of the progress we’ve made in developing our riverfront. 
RepTimRyan,.@FirstEnergyCorp and members of the Ohio Power Siting Board do the right thing. Youngstowners do not like this plan. It should be rejected.
RepTimRyan,Record high corporate profits. Record high CEO pay. All while costs go up and wages stagnate. Enough. Today I will vote to hold Big Oil and wealthy executives accountable for price-gouging hardworking Ohioans and exploiting our workers.
RepTimRyan,Americans—particularly Black Asian and Jewish Americans—are being killed by racist acts of violence.Today I voted on legislation that will provide law enforcement and our communities with more resources needed to combat domestic terrorism.Hate has no home here. 
RepTimRyan,Our nation's formula shortage is a life or death issue – not only for parents with babies but for those with metabolic conditions who rely on formula to survive.The legislation we passed tonight will address this shortage immediately and get every Ohioan the formula they need. 
RepTimRyan,For 57 years @NatlHeadStart has stepped up to meet the needs of countless children across our country and given them the tools to succeed including right here in Northeast Ohio.Join me in wishing them a happy birthday!#HappyBDayHeadStart 
RepTimRyan,It’s unacceptable that millions of parents in this country are struggling to find baby formula. I will vote today to help solve this crisis with a bill that addresses supply chain issues and empowers the FDA to deal with this shortage directly.
RepTimRyan,Now Congress must pass the SFC Heath Robinson Honoring our PACT Act immediately and finally get our veterans who’ve put their lives on the line for us the quality healthcare they deserve.
RepTimRyan,I was proud to work with @sensherrodbrown in passing our bill the SFC Heath Robinson Act in the House. It’s in Heath’s name that we will make sure our veterans who’ve been exposed to toxic burn pits get the attention and help they deserve. 
RepTimRyan,BREAKING: The Senate has reached a deal on legislation that supports our veterans exposed to toxic burn pits and named it after Ohio veteran SFC Heath Robinson. 
RepTimRyan,We can all learn something by the example Thomas is setting. Thanks for making our community a better place @PodcastHometown! Keep up the amazing work. 
RepTimRyan,Bullies only understand one thing: strength. This is about freedom vs. tyranny. It’s not our job to manage Putin’s feelings. 
RepTimRyan,I’m joining my colleagues in urging @POTUS to take immediate action to address the infant formula shortage. No parent in this country should be struggling to keep their babies fed. We can never let this happen again. 
RepTimRyan,Ohio is on the verge of leading the world into the next generation of manufacturing. It’s never been more important that we reinvest in the job training programs that will make sure our workers are skilled and ready to go.
