SenBlumenthal,My heart breaks as I re-live the shock &amp; grief of Sandy Hook ten years ago knowing the infinite pain that will hit these families in Texas. This senseless violence will stop only when Congress matches thoughts &amp; prayers with action.
SenBlumenthal,No words can capture my wrenching sadness for the Robb Elementary School families &amp; for our great nation that continues to be torn apart by horrendous gun violence—taking so many beautiful lives &amp; spreading anguish &amp; horror. 
SenBlumenthal,Circle of Friends ceremony at Beth Israel Synagogue recognized extraordinary public service by inspiring young heroes to help &amp; support people with disabilities. They are leading by example—a tribute to their families &amp; our community.
SenBlumenthal,Exciting ride on @shorelineeast M8 electric train—smooth quiet comfortable with cleaner power. Thanks to Kelvin driving today &amp; all the fantastic rail workers (maintenance conductor engineers &amp; more) for your great service. 
SenBlumenthal,Parents are right to be fearful &amp; frustrated. Many steps must be taken to counteract the infant formula crisis: increased imports quick utilization of the Defense Production Act &amp; enhancements to WIC to make online purchases accessible. Babies &amp; their caregivers need action. 
SenBlumenthal,Sikorsky’s new era helicopters—Defiant X &amp; Raider X—offer unmatched versatility maneuverability reliability &amp; more. Also the most cost effective to buy &amp; fly. Made by CT based Sikorsky they should be clear winners for American troops who deserve decisive air superiority.
SenBlumenthal,Bill signing by @GovNedLamont today—marking a milestone agreement with Sikorsky—means more than 7000 jobs in CT making the next generation of helicopters. We have the world’s best helicopter workforce—now we need the work. I’ll be fighting for Sikorsky to win DOD contracts. 
SenBlumenthal,Vigil Against Violence in Stamford brought together faith leaders law enforcement&amp;public officials committed to stopping the cancer of hatred spreading in our society spawning tragedies like Buffalo. We must pass the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act&amp;implement the NO HATE Act. 
SenBlumenthal,Commencement at Albertus Magnus yesterday celebrated this wonderful school’s spectacular seniors &amp; tradition of Veritas &amp; Vision—study faith community &amp; service. Thanks to President Marc Camille &amp; his extraordinary team of faculty staff &amp; trustees. 
SenBlumenthal,Hartford Stage’s Spring Gala had plenty of stars last night—its stupendous staff board volunteers&amp;supporters who enable its artistic excellence&amp;educational outreach. Federal funds through the SVOG Act—which I was proud to lead—aided their dedicated work during the pandemic.
SenBlumenthal,Such moving powerful stories about mental health needs from participants in NAMIWalks Your Way 2022 in Hartford. Hundreds walked &amp; talked giving face &amp; voice to advocacy for behavioral health investment.
SenBlumenthal,Celebrating 150+1 at Bishop’s Orchards—a tribute to 6 family generations (soon 7). Their dedication to serving customers &amp; the community is inspiring. Moving remarks &amp; reminisces from family members filled with warmth &amp; humor—showing why they have such deep respect &amp; affection.
SenBlumenthal,Only in CT the Shad Derby Parade in Windsor is a gem—drawing huge turnout especially after a 2 year hiatus. Tremendous thanks to the town CT Jaycees fellow marchers &amp; of course the shad—fished in Windsor since its founding in 1633. 
SenBlumenthal,Proud to be among hundreds who gathered in Hartford to support @CTFoodshare—walking to raise funds &amp; send a message. Food insecurity is a persistent pressing problem here &amp; around our great nation. 
SenBlumenthal,Putin has banned me from Russia—a badge of honor from a barbaric butcher. My message back: America must expand military aid humanitarian help &amp; crippling economic measures to assure brave fierce Ukrainian fighters defeat you. 
SenBlumenthal,Raising rates by almost 5% Eversource hits consumers by passing on their higher costs. No doubt Putin’s barbaric assault on Ukraine has increased costs of gas &amp; oil used to make electricity but ratepayers shouldn’t bear the whole burden.
SenBlumenthal,The looming significant increase in electricity prices is coming at the worst moment for consumers. Eversource should do their part to ease the impact by reducing their profits from electricity sales in CT. 
SenBlumenthal,Hate crimes breed &amp; inspire broader conflict &amp; division. We must follow our better angels.
SenBlumenthal,Every individual must stand up &amp; speak out against hate crimes &amp; violent extremism. Silence is complicity. New laws are necessary such as the Domestic Terrorism Protection Act which I have co-sponsored from the start &amp; will advocate this week in the Senate.
SenBlumenthal,Fighting hate &amp; domestic terrorism such as we saw in Buffalo means devoting more funding to the NO HATE Act &amp; supporting police &amp; all law enforcement in their work against hate crimes as well as community based responses &amp; alternative sentencing.
SenBlumenthal,On the 1st anniv. of Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act I’m grateful for the important work underway to combat hate crimes&amp;focused on the urgent need for more vigorous action. Hate racism violent extremism white supremacy&amp;more are a cancer continuing to metastasize across the country. 
SenBlumenthal,For equality &amp; justice for all we need the #ERANow. An arbitrary decades-old deadline shouldn’t stop women &amp; girls from having their rights guaranteed in the Constitution. It’s beyond time for #SJRes1 to come to the Senate floor.
SenBlumenthal,SafeGraph &amp; Placer are putting people’s lives at risk by making data available to anti-abortion activists &amp; politicians. This is an assault on a person’s right to make private health care decisions &amp; I join my colleagues in demanding they immediately end this practice. 
SenBlumenthal,I'm particularly proud to have secured provisions to extend benefits to Palomares vet survivors &amp; VA health care to K2 vets. For years I’ve advocated for them &amp; all who suffer from exposure to toxins &amp; poisons while serving.
SenBlumenthal,Spectacular news! Doing right by our vets means doing right by all vet generations afflicted by toxic exposure. I have fought for this comprehensive package &amp; will work to swiftly approve it. 
SenBlumenthal,President Biden is right to utilize the Defense Protection Act—as I’ve urged—to help ease the infant formula shortage. Parents need solutions. We must work urgently to provide vital nutrition to babies. More imports too. 
SenBlumenthal,The facts are simple—domestic violence is 5x more deadly when there is a gun in the house. Today we are hearing from witnesses about the need to protect survivors &amp; close loopholes to keep firearms out of the hands of abusers. 
SenBlumenthal,With President Biden’s signature the Safe Sleep for Babies Act will prevent more needless tragedies &amp; save new parents from unknowingly purchasing perilous padding for their children’s cribs. I’m proud to have joined my colleagues in this bipartisan effort. 
SenBlumenthal,Wonderful to meet with Finland’s Ambassador Hautala yesterday as their parliament approves joining NATO. Putin’s barbaric brutal invasion is bolstering NATO &amp; bringing together nations that prize freedom &amp; democracy now under assault.
