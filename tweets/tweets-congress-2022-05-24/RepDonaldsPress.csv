RepDonaldsPress,No family should have to bury their loved one because of the actions of a sick &amp; deranged animal.

RepDonaldsPress,Thank you @RepTroyNehls for inviting me to see firsthand America's first-class energy sector in Houston.Now more than ever we need to support our energy sector and reject the Green New Deal policies that are slashing this industry and costing us more at the ‚õΩÔ∏è. 
RepDonaldsPress,Since Biden took office my @HSBCgop and I have continually stated that every state is a border state under Biden's open border policies. This disturbing development in my home state of Florida speaks to the magnitude and danger of this admin's purposeful neglect of the border. 
RepDonaldsPress,The creation of the Disinfo Governance Board ‚Äî even with the recently announced pause ‚Äî will prove to be volatile and detrimental to civilized political discourse in our nation.

RepDonaldsPress,DEMs soft on crime policies like cashless bail &amp; refusal to prosecute empower criminals &amp; leave innocent Americans like Daniel Enriquez dead on a Sunday morning while out for brunch.Liberal politicians like @NYCMayor are paying lip service to these victims and their families. 
RepDonaldsPress,ICYMI: I joined @RobFinnertyUSA on Newsmax this morning to discuss the White House once again being late to provide solutions to a crisis the ramifications of Biden‚Äôs baby formula shortage and this admin's lack of supply chain management.More of my thoughts below ‚¨áÔ∏è 
RepDonaldsPress,The European shipment of baby formula is nothing more than a fig leaf from this administration as they pray and hope the mainstream media will forget about their inability to implement proactive and strategic policy.President Biden and the Democrats have no plan.@Varneyco

RepDonaldsPress,Instead of slashing burdensome regulations and easing trade restrictions Democrats on Capitol Hill seek $28 million for the FDA the agency responsible for this crisis. The solution is not increasing the FDA‚Äôs funding.Read my entire statement below: ‚§µÔ∏è

RepDonaldsPress,Today I introduced the House companion of the Financial Freedom Act of 2022. This bill prohibits Biden's @USDOL from restricting the type of investments that self-directed 401(k) account investors can choose. The great @SenTuberville is championing this bill in the U.S. Senate. 
RepDonaldsPress,ICYMI: @FoxFriendsFirst covered my questioning in yesterday's @GOPoversight hearing regarding CRT entering our children's math curriculum. This should go without saying but racial equity training doesn't belong in math or any subject in K-12.  Let kids be kids. 
RepDonaldsPress,Today I participated in a @GOPoversight hearing on the curriculum in the classroom &amp; I addressed the introduction of racial equity in our children's math textbooks.Bar graphs are meant for REAL math not radical indoctrination meant to divide our nation &amp; hold back our kids.
