RepMichaelGuest,In just 16 months in charge President Biden and Vice President Harris have made America unaffordable for middle class Americans.
RepMichaelGuest,Don’t miss my conversation on the @paulgalloshow this morning at 8:37 a.m. Listen live at 
RepMichaelGuest,Tune in tomorrow morning at 8:37 a.m. as I join the @paulgalloshow on @supertalk to discuss the latest news from Washington D.C. and Congress.
RepMichaelGuest,Congratulations to the @HailStateSB team &amp; @Coach_Ricketts for advancing to the super regionals for the first time in program history.To top it off they will be hosting the first softball super regional in our state’s history. We are proud of our Bulldogs. #HailState
RepMichaelGuest,Left-wing Democrats are attacking the principles that have made this country the greatest nation in history. They will not succeed. Republicans will always stand for the traditional values that have made America exceptional.
RepMichaelGuest,The left cannot blame high gas prices on “price gouging.” When the President attacks domestic oil production and makes America reliant on foreign oil the price goes up. Just like every other crisis they’ve created they want to blame someone else other than themselves.
RepMichaelGuest,In recent years the @WHO has largely rejected Taiwan’s requests to participate in technical meetings due to pressure from China. I will continue to advocate for Taiwan’s inclusion in these important conversations at the #WorldHealthAssembly.
RepMichaelGuest,Total encounters under this Administration taking numbers since February of 2021 are 2735000 encounters... At the current rate next month it will eclipse three additional states including my home state of Mississippi.
RepMichaelGuest,"Biden’s ""Disinformation Board"" has been stopped in its tracks — a great win for freedom. I was proud to help lead CHS Republicans in pushing back against such a totalitarian overreach.  We must protect free speech against the left's attempts to muzzle conservative ideas."
RepMichaelGuest,U.S. border officials encountered 234088 migrants attempting to enter the country illegally in April. That’s the highest number in Homeland Security history. Meanwhile the Biden Administration does nothing but ignore and block common-sense Republican solutions.
RepMichaelGuest,We need strong policies to address the crisis &amp; unfortunately this bill did not include those reforms. (3/3)
RepMichaelGuest,Republicans proposed using a comprehensive approach to identify how we can get more formula on the shelves but these ideas were rejected by House Democrats. Instead House Democrats opted to throw money at a problem that can’t simply be fixed with more government spending. (2/3)
RepMichaelGuest,The baby formula issue is not a money problem. The USDA currently has $1 billion it could use to address the crisis. It’s a supply problem that was created after a baby formula plant was shut down due to a recall at the facility. (1/3)
RepMichaelGuest,I’ve been to the border more times than the President. I’ve spoken directly to border patrol agents. They want Title 42 and Republicans are fighting to support them. 
RepMichaelGuest,Border security IS national security. That’s why @RepYoungKim and I introduced legislation to develop a strategy on our southern border something this Administration continues to fail to do. 
RepMichaelGuest,It was an honor to join @RepJuliaLetlow to introduce the National Police Week resolution. This legislation signals that as their elected officials Congress stands with officers to honor those men &amp; women who paid the ultimate price in service to our communities &amp; to our nation.
RepMichaelGuest,Border security IS national security. The Biden Administration now has the worst record on border security in the last century if not history of our nation.
