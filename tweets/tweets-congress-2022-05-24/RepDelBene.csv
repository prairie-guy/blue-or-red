RepDelBene,This year I secured $500K for @VOAWW to expand their services &amp; build a new teen center which would provide services like food clothing tutoring emergency shelter &amp; mental health support for kids outside of school hours.
RepDelBene,The new @VOAWW Thrift Store in Sultan is driven by the Sky Valley Youth Coalition &amp; I am impressed by their work &amp; commitment to giving back to our community. 
RepDelBene,This is an administration that steps up &amp; stands up for families. Operation Fly Formula is well on its way &amp; we will continue to work tirelessly to get formula back on the shelves for our kids. 
RepDelBene,Taiwan has been a reliable partner in addressing public health crises like COVID &amp; their participation in the #WorldHealthAssembly should not be politicized.  Tackling this virus has been a global effort &amp; Taiwan should have a seat at the table. #TaiwanCanHelp
RepDelBene,A pro-life party would support children after they‚Äôre born.¬†¬†¬†Appalling that so many of my GOP colleagues won‚Äôt help parents feed their babies. 
RepDelBene,Families are getting hit hard at the pump while gas companies are raking in record profits. @HouseDemocrats passed legislation this week to:¬†¬†‚úÖ End price gouging¬†‚úÖ Penalize market manipulators¬†‚úÖ Create market transparency &amp; keep big oil companies accountable
RepDelBene,We can't let the constitutional right to an abortion be rolled back. We must pass the #WomensHealthProtectionAct.
RepDelBene,Oklahoma GOP passed the most extreme attack on repro health this week by banning ANY abortion after fertilization &amp; allowing individuals to sue doctors for providing reproductive care.
RepDelBene,@SnohomishCounty is holding meetings throughout May &amp; June with local elected officials to discuss recovery funding &amp; hear your stories. Childcare &amp; dinner will be included at no cost. For more info:¬†
RepDelBene,Snohomish County: You can have a say in how #AmericanRescuePlan dollars can best serve our community as we continue to recover.
RepDelBene,But kids don‚Äôt grow up in just one year. I‚Äôll continue fighting until we make this benefit permanent.
RepDelBene,Long before the pandemic too many families have struggled to pay for the day-to-day needs of their kids from housing to diapers. Monthly #ChildTaxCredit payments gave parents predictability &amp; helped put food on the table. 
RepDelBene,This is progress &amp; we must continue this work by lowering costs for families &amp; making long-term investments in our economy.
RepDelBene,The Biden economic agenda has helped get Americans back to work with record-high job creation.  For the first time in over half a century the number of Americans on unemployment insurance has fallen below 1%.
RepDelBene,‚úàÔ∏è Biden‚Äôs Operation Fly Formula will help ease the baby formula shortage by having @DeptofDefense use federal planes to fly in 1.5M 8-ounce bottles from abroad &amp; get formula on the shelves ASAP.All formula is hypoallergenic &amp; meets U.S. health &amp; safety standards.
RepDelBene,Also this week the House passed¬†bills to boost imports of safe formula &amp; help families on WIC get formula.¬†It‚Äôs critical that families have access to safe formula to feed their kids &amp; we will continue to take action to ease this shortage.
RepDelBene,Democrats are acting to address the baby formula shortage that parents are facing. @POTUS just invoked the Defense Production Act to increase baby formula production &amp; get it to the shelves faster. 
RepDelBene,It was wonderful to welcome Documented Dreamers from my district &amp; around the country to D.C. this week to hear their stories &amp; talk about meaningful immigration reform.Our #Dreamers are home &amp; we need to pave a pathway to citizenship for all of them. 
RepDelBene,The bipartisan infrastructure law is delivering funds to strengthen broadband infrastructure but we can‚Äôt stop fighting until we‚Äôve achieved universal access.
RepDelBene,For rural communities telehealth is critical to making care more accessible but w/o affordable reliable broadband access many digital health tools are still out of reach. 
RepDelBene,I‚Äôve continually advocated for increased IRS funding &amp; this report should lead to action.
RepDelBene,In the past decade IRS funding has consistently decreased leading to staff shortages &amp; a significant drop in audits esp. among the wealthiest Americans. The IRS needs adequate funding to ensure our tax code is enforced fairly.
RepDelBene,More at-home #COVID rapid test kits are available to order starting this week!¬†¬†You can order up to 8 FREE tests. Visit  or call 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489) to get yours!
RepDelBene,If SCOTUS overturns Roe &amp; we don‚Äôt pass privacy legislation this sensitive data could be used against women seeking abortions &amp; repro care.My privacy bill proposal would set the rules of the road &amp; put consumers in control of their data. 
RepDelBene,W/o a national consumer data privacy law millions of Americans‚Äô personal data including health info is unprotected.
RepDelBene,I will continue working hard to secure these federal dollars for our community.
RepDelBene,NEW: I submitted 15 community projects in WA-01 for dedicated funding consideration!These projects span our district &amp; include regional trail &amp; roadway improvements health &amp; wellness centers green job training emergency services &amp; wastewater &amp; sewer infrastructure projects. 
RepDelBene,The @NewDemCoalition turns 2Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ this year‚Äî&amp; I am honored to chair our growing coalition during this milestone! Thanks to everyone over the years who has helped make our caucus the force that it is today.  #25YearsofNewDems #MajorityMakers 
RepDelBene,All women next üëè ‚öΩ #EqualPayForEqualWork
RepDelBene,Last week the House passed a $40B relief package to support Ukraine with humanitarian diplomatic &amp; military aid.  The Senate must swiftly deliver this bill to @POTUS‚Äô desk this week to ensure timely &amp; consistent support as Putin‚Äôs horrific war rages on.
