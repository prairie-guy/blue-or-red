PatrickMcHenry,Instead of finding solutions to relieve the suffering of American families caused by high gas prices Democrats would rather play the blame game. But how can they expect the American people to play along when even President Biden’s Energy Secretary doesn’t buy it? 
PatrickMcHenry,Yesterday I voted against a bill introduced by Democrats that does nothing to relieve the suffering of American families caused by high gas prices. This is nothing more than an attempt to pass the blame to anyone but themselves. 
PatrickMcHenry,Every day our law enforcement officials here in #NC10 put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe. Yet thanks to the Democrats’ far-left agenda that job has become a lot more dangerous. 
PatrickMcHenry,Since Biden took office there have been more than 2.6 million illegal immigrants apprehended at our southern border. These shocking numbers come as the Biden administration prepares to lift Title 42 in less than a week. This is reckless we must secure our borders. 
PatrickMcHenry,As this graph demonstrates gas has never been more expensive. Today the average price of gas in #NC is $4.32 a gallon the highest ever recorded price. Instead of working to ease the burden at the pump Dems are pursuing far-left policies that will make gas even more expensive.
