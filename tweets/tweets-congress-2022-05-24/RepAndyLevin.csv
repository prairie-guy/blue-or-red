RepAndyLevin,This is not normal and should not be accepted. Full stop. Our country cannot be desensitized to such mass‚Äîand preventable‚Äîdeath. I will never stop fighting for gun reform. Our childrens‚Äô lives quite literally depend on it.
RepAndyLevin,I‚Äôm a dad who knows what it‚Äôs like to wake my kids up for school and help them get ready. To make them breakfast and cherish that shared time together. Sadly the parents of 14 children shared their last moments with their kids this morning without even knowing it.
RepAndyLevin,End the madness. End the madness. End the madness. No more excuses. We need reform to stem the gun violence epidemic now! 
RepAndyLevin,The #XinjiangPoliceFiles confirm what we already know: the Chinese government is committing crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other minorities in the region. @SecBlinken @USUN must push @UNHumanRights chief to raise these issues w/ CCP officials 
RepAndyLevin,As the climate crisis worsens the need for clean energy could not be more urgent. I was proud to join @RepHuffman and @SenMarkey‚Äôs letter to @POTUS to urge a trans-Atlantic effort to transition to clean energy. 
RepAndyLevin,Today was the day that the Trump administration‚Äôs racist anti-immigrant Title 42 policy was set to expire but a federal judge blocked the Biden administration from ending it. I applaud @POTUS‚Äô decision to appeal this unjust ruling. Asylum is a human right. 
RepAndyLevin,It‚Äôs so critical that we uplift the Black voices that have been writing and advocating for Haiti for decades. Far too often their work is overlooked and undervalued. 
RepAndyLevin,Yet they are mostly being ignored by U.S. media and the Biden administration tragically is not supporting them.
RepAndyLevin,A remarkably broad and representative swath of Haitian civil society has come together to chart a way out of the country‚Äôs deepening crisis and a new course to restore Haitian democracy.
RepAndyLevin,Now that the @nytimes has drawn the world‚Äôs attention to the astounding effects on Haiti to this day of historical wrongs let‚Äôs shine light on what‚Äôs happening right now. üßµ
RepAndyLevin,If nonbelievers need more proof on how lifechanging it would be for @POTUS to #CancelStudentDebt they can look at the replies here. üëáüèª 
RepAndyLevin,We are struggling to advance the idea of reparations here in the US. Surely France and the US owe massive reparations to the Haitian people as documented here.
RepAndyLevin,But this new research by the NYT showing the astounding extent to which these illegitimate and immoral payments have impoverished Haiti to this day represents a real blockbuster.
RepAndyLevin,The obscene story of former French slave masters collecting a ransom from Haitians for their own freedom over many decades is not new although it is way too little known. (When I tell people about it I often feel they don‚Äôt believe me.) üßµ 
RepAndyLevin,As the largest oil and gas companies continue to rake in massive profits working families are struggling to put gas in the tank. It‚Äôs time to hold Big Oil‚Äôs price-gouging accountable. 
RepAndyLevin,Read more here: 
RepAndyLevin,Today @SenOssoff and I led 86 of our colleagues in a letter to @TheJusticeDept asking AG Garland to address the increase in threats and violence against election workers. As we near the 2022 midterm elections election workers at all levels deserve to feel supported &amp; protected.
RepAndyLevin,Every single person in this country‚Äì no matter where they live or how much money they make ‚Äì should be able to make their own decisions about their bodies and their lives. Abortion rights are human rights.
RepAndyLevin,It‚Äôs an incredible honor to use my voice in Congress to advocate for much-needed resources in Oakland and Macomb Counties to ensure no one is left behind. 
RepAndyLevin,To combat rising costs in the grocery stores and gas pumps I‚Äôm calling on @POTUS to #CancelStudentDebt for nearly 45 million Americans and put hundreds of dollars a month back into the pockets of working families who are struggling to pay their bills.
RepAndyLevin,Today marks National Asian &amp; Pacific Islander HIV/AIDS Awareness Day to raise awareness of the impact of the virus in the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. Today we recommit to ending the stigma and advocating for greater resources for the AAPI community.
RepAndyLevin,I‚Äôm happy that @POTUS is stepping up to take action and address our nation‚Äôs baby formula crisis. Poor and working-class parents need urgent relief and it‚Äôs our job to deliver for them.
RepAndyLevin,If fully funded these new projects chosen to align with principles of equity and accessibility will bring over $19 million to communities in Oakland and Macomb Counties. It‚Äôs an incredible honor to use my voice to ensure no one is left behind. 
RepAndyLevin,It was a pleasure to host Israeli intelligence expert and former Mossad director Efraim Halevy for a briefing with House colleagues. We had a productive discussion on Iran nuclear deal negotiations a two-state solution and ways to further peace between Israelis and Palestinians. 
RepAndyLevin,Low-wage workers already struggling to make ends meet are being robbed by bad-actor employers nationwide. That‚Äôs why I spoke proudly in support of H.R. 7701 the Wage Theft Prevention and Wage Recovery Act during today‚Äôs @EdLaborCmte markup.
RepAndyLevin,This grotesque theory beyond its blatant xenophobia has inspired targeted killings of Jews including the 2018 Pittsburgh Tree of Life synagogue shooting and Poway synagogue shooting in 2019.
RepAndyLevin,White replacement theory has deep antisemitic origins rooted in notions that Jews are conspiring to replace white Americans with members of minority communities. (1/2)
RepAndyLevin,It is incumbent upon all of us to combat hate-based movements that target the Jewish community and other marginalized groups.
RepAndyLevin,Jewish communities across the United States remain threatened by the scourge of antisemitism. Dangerous and harmful conspiracy theories promoted by the far right have endangered Jews across the country. 
RepAndyLevin,The House Haiti Caucus chose #HaitianFlagDay when we formed our caucus because we believe that freedom and self-determination are the bedrock of Haiti. 
RepAndyLevin,Last week we opened the door to House unionization. Now we need to implement it. Read my testimony to @AppropsDems below. üëáüèª 
RepAndyLevin,Is this news? Given @elonmusk‚Äôs history of union busting and unfair labor practices it‚Äôs not surprising that he opposes policies to help workers organize and fight for their rights. 
RepAndyLevin,Sadly Michiganders know all too well the dangers of PFAS &amp; the detriment it poses to our children‚Äôs health &amp; development even in small quantities. I‚Äôve been laser-focused on doing everything I can to get PFAS out of our schools and communities. 
RepAndyLevin,One million lives lost to COVID-19 is an incredibly grim milestone and stark reminder of the toll the pandemic has taken on our nation and our families. Please continue to get vaccinated boosted trust the science and take this virus seriously.
RepAndyLevin,It's so important that even as Putin's war of aggression rages on a demand for justice and accountability is heard. Ukraine is fighting boldly for its nascent democracy and must be supported. 
RepAndyLevin,At a time when our country needed him most Louis DeJoy went in exactly the wrong direction reducing the @USPS‚Äô effectiveness. We‚Äôve got to get him out of his leadership role. #FireDeJoy
RepAndyLevin,My bill with @SenMarkey the Enhancing North Korea Humanitarian Assistance Act would ensure that lifesaving humanitarian aid provided by NGOs can reach the people of North Korea. Let's get this done. (2/2) 
RepAndyLevin,The COVID outbreak is a reminder that North Koreans have almost no access to basic medicine and health care let alone vaccines. We need to ensure that sanctions are not preventing urgently needed humanitarian aid from reaching the people. (1/2)
