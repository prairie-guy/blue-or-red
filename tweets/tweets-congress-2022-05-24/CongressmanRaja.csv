CongressmanRaja,Everyone should watch this. 
CongressmanRaja,I am heartbroken over the news of the shooting in Uvalde Texas this evening. The victim's families and the entire community are in my thoughts tonight. As the details emerge we must work to prevent future tragedies. 
CongressmanRaja,Transparency is the first step to discovering how these shortages came about. @RepMaloney and I launched an investigation into infant formula manufacturers in order to find out the truth. 
CongressmanRaja,For 50 years a woman’s right to choose has been protected. Now a new generation of Americans are being forced to fight harder than ever to defend it.
CongressmanRaja,Putin’s war is so unpopular and immoral that former Russian diplomats are taking unprecedented actions to call out their own government’s actions in Ukraine.
CongressmanRaja,After everything we’ve learned over the years President Trump’s omission appears predictable. 
CongressmanRaja,Important reminders for all of us as we work to end this pandemic for good. 
CongressmanRaja,As a parent myself I strongly encourage everyone to get their children vaccinated. COVID-19 cases are on the rise again and vaccines are vital to protecting our kids. 
CongressmanRaja,Getting infant formula to our parents is essential. I’m thankful the Biden Administration is using the full powers of the government to address the shortage. 
CongressmanRaja,Proud to join my colleagues in passing this legislation to crack down on price gouging and help lower prices at the pump. 
CongressmanRaja,The actions of Russian troops in the war in Ukraine have been appalling and its fitting that accountability is coming so swiftly. 
CongressmanRaja,I take being included on Vladimir Putin’s enemies list as a mark of honor and will continue to stand by people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy. 
CongressmanRaja,The Access to Baby Formula Act I voted for this week is a big step in getting families the formula they need for their children. But larger questions remain why this happened in the first place and my investigation continues
CongressmanRaja,“John Eastman the architect of a strategy to overturn the 2020 election dealt directly with President Donald J. Trump and received handwritten notes from him as the men sought to keep Mr. Trump in power.” 
CongressmanRaja,Overturning Roe v. Wade is just the beginning. Republicans are set on rolling back even more basic rights and they will unless we vote for pro-choice candidates. 
CongressmanRaja,Putin’s unprovoked war is costing the lives of innocent civilians. All potential war crimes must be investigated. 
CongressmanRaja,No one is above the law. 
CongressmanRaja,Learning Asian American history is a major step forward in combatting the ignorance that so often begets racism. 
CongressmanRaja,“In sending the emails Thomas played a role in the extraordinary scheme to keep Trump in office by substituting the will of legislatures for the will of voters.”
CongressmanRaja,We must codify Roe v. Wade before other states follow suit with these draconian laws. 
CongressmanRaja,Everyone involved in the planning and coordination of the January 6th insurrection must be held accountable. 
CongressmanRaja,The CDC is now recommending children 5 to 11 get a Covid booster shot. Staying up to date on vaccinations is the only way to continue to move past this pandemic. 
CongressmanRaja,Poll workers are essential to running a smooth free and fair election. It’s a great way to be a cog in your community’s democratic process
CongressmanRaja,Now more than ever the U.S. needs an ambassador in Ukraine. I’m glad to see the Senate confirmed career Foreign Service officer Bridget Brink to be that person. 
CongressmanRaja,Back in November the vast majority of Americans including Republicans say decisions on abortions should be left between the woman and her doctor. We must codify Roe. 
CongressmanRaja, 
CongressmanRaja,We have made great progress on the pandemic but we must remain vigilant and provide more funding for vaccination programs around the world before the next variant emerges.
CongressmanRaja,Domestic violent extremists continue to target minority communities. The bipartisan Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act I voted for yesterday will address this by providing more resources to law enforcement to prevent future attacks from happening. 
CongressmanRaja,I want to thank President Biden for invoking the Defense Production Act to ensure manufacturers can start speeding up supply of much needed baby formula for American families. 
CongressmanRaja,I’m glad to see the Senate has passed the much needed assistance package for the Ukrainian people. They need our full support to defeat Putin and defend their democracy. 
CongressmanRaja,Big oil companies are pulling in tremendous profits while Americans are getting burned at the pump. Today I was proud to vote to stop price gouging and end anti-consumer practices. 
CongressmanRaja,It was a privilege to welcome Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to the Capitol on Tuesday and hear him speak on the importance of safeguarding our shared democratic values across the world. 
CongressmanRaja,Finland and Sweden joining NATO means a stronger and safer Europe. I fully support their applications to join the alliance. 
CongressmanRaja,Funding for more vaccines is the only way to completely end the pandemic. Other nations are acting on it now we need to as well. 
CongressmanRaja,While Americans are paying through the roof at the pump big oil continues to make record profits. I wrote to ExxonMobil and Chevron asking for answers. 
CongressmanRaja,The economic sanctions on Putin’s unjust invasion of Ukraine are working. We must keep the pressure on. 
CongressmanRaja,My bipartisan legislation would invoke the Defense Production Act to ensure the federal government can step in and help create a greater supply of baby formula for our nation's parents. 
CongressmanRaja,Thank you to the Indian American Impact Project for inviting me to take part in their panel discussion on the importance of representation and public service as well as the pressing issues that our country faces today. 
CongressmanRaja,Our country must hold all those involved in the January 6 insurrection accountable.
CongressmanRaja,Glad to see this step forward for pay equity.
CongressmanRaja,It’s a terrible sign when a club owned by a former President seems like it would be the most likely location for an “Alex Jones International [Conspiracy] Film Festival” Let me know if that reads alright to you.
