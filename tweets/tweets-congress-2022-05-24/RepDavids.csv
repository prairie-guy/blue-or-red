RepDavids,Harnessing the power of our local manufacturers not only improves our supply chain but also lowers costs and reduces inflation.Logistics Park KC and @jocogov's short line railroad are doing this work right here at home. Thanks for the tour today! 
RepDavids,Last night I hosted a Mental Health Resource Fair to highlight the important work of our community partners &amp; health experts.Even though #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth is coming to an end Iâ€™ll continue advocating for increased access to mental health care because it saves lives. 
RepDavids,Rising gas prices are hurting folks who rely on a vehicle to make their living. Iâ€™m asking the IRS to adjust the mileage deduction and give small business owners and independent contractors a break.
RepDavids,"This weekend I had the privilege of helping dedicate a ""Never Forget Garden"" in Overland Park in honor of our veterans.I cannot wait for folks both young and old to visit this space and honor the heroes in our community. "

RepDavids,I know lots of families are concerned about the baby formula shortage. See our new email update for resources that may help and for an update on how I'm pushing for progress:  
RepDavids,This is why I supported the bipartisan infrastructure law - to help projects like Johnson Countyâ€™s Nelson Wastewater to:ðŸ‘·create jobs in #KS03ðŸš¿deliver cleaner safer waterðŸ’µsave Kansans money on their water bill
RepDavids,Itâ€™s a fact: students enrolled in Head Start are healthier have better social skills and are more likely to graduate high school.57 years after the program's creation Iâ€™m thankful to support #KS03 families through programs like Growing Futures @tfckc @kckschools and more. 
RepDavids,Last week we started negotiations on a major bipartisan package to boost American manufacturing reduce inflation and stand up to China.Glad to work across the aisle to create a future thatâ€™s made in Kansas.
RepDavids,It's been six months since we passed the bipartisan infrastructure law and it's already bringing jobs and opportunity to our community.Good to see the Greater KC Chamber this week and share how I'm working to make #KS03 an even stronger place to start and grow a business!
