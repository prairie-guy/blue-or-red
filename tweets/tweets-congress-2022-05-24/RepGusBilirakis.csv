RepGusBilirakis,Relieved to see agreement on the PACT Act which I supported in the House.  Exposure to burn pit toxins is the Agent Orange of our era.  We must ensure the brave men and women who are coming home sick have access to the care and benefits they deserve! 
RepGusBilirakis,Proud to live in a state that embraces freedom and is welcoming to visitors.  It is vital to our economy!
RepGusBilirakis,It is unfortunate that constituents have been victimized by these scammers and that there are not currently more safeguards in place to help them recoup their losses. I’ll continue to work on this issue while educating consumers about the potential danger.
RepGusBilirakis,Thankful that a federal judge blocked the Biden Administration’s plans to worsen the #BidenBorderCrisis by lifting Title 42 this week.  
RepGusBilirakis,Contrary to Democrats' continued assertions throwing money at a problem doesn't make it go away.  I've cosponsored the Babies Need More Formula Now Act which addresses the root causes of the formula shortage and provides practical solutions.  
RepGusBilirakis,This bill did nothing to address the formula shortage except throw more money at the problem which is why I voted no. The FDA just received an additional $102 million yet bureaucrats at the agency delayed conducting much-needed inspections making this crisis worse.
RepGusBilirakis,A special thank you to everyone who participated in my 16th Annual Veterans’ Resource Fair. We had a great turnout and the feedback from Veterans in attendance indicated that they found it to be extremely useful. I'll continue connecting Veterans with available resources. 
RepGusBilirakis,It's #ArmedForcesDay honoring Americans serving in the U.S. Army U.S. Navy U.S. Marine Corps United States Air Force U.S. Coast Guard and United States Space Force!  #ArmedForcesWeek #MilitaryAppreciationMonth 
RepGusBilirakis,The number of police officers killed in the line of duty increased 59% last year compared to 2020—the most in over two decades. 
RepGusBilirakis,The majority of Americans are having difficulty paying for basic necessities because of #Bidenflation.  We need to stop the reckless spending and implement basic commonsense measures to provide immediate relief. 
RepGusBilirakis,ICYMI- Pasco County's Community Development Department has won national acclaim for its innovative work to provide affordable housing options for residents. 
RepGusBilirakis,The root cause of the #BidenBorderCrisis is President Biden’s refusal to uphold the law and defend our border.  In fact his open border policies incentivize and reward those who break the law and illegally enter our country. 
RepGusBilirakis,As Democrats rush to further fuel inflation by spending more of your tax dollars look at their track record—no accountability and oversight led to $163 billion being stolen or misspent! 
RepGusBilirakis,This is the worst energy crisis in 50 years because of this Administration’s war on domestic production.  We need to regain American Energy Independence!
RepGusBilirakis,In a recent poll 70% of Americans said #Bidenflation is a “very big problem.”  With statistics like this it is easy to see why! 
RepGusBilirakis,My team was honored to be on hand when our local Honor Flight Attendees returned home.  I'm thrilled we were able to remove the bureaucratic hurdles that threatened to jeopardize this wonderful program.  On behalf of a grateful nation thank you for your service and welcome home! 
RepGusBilirakis,Encroaching on the rights of law-abiding citizens will not decrease crime.  We need to target criminals by consistently enforcing existing laws prosecuting criminals and supporting law enforcement. I'll keep fighting to protect the #2ndAmendment
