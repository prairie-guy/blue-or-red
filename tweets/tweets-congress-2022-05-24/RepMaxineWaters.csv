RepMaxineWaters,When will this country come together to denounce and deter the killing of innocent children and adults by heavily armed killers in a society where guns are so easily accessible? Another recent mass killing of 14 children in Uvalde Texas by an 18-year-old! Gun Control now!
RepMaxineWaters,This is Asian and Pacific Islander Month. I join with the AAPI Community in celebrating their accomplishments! I also join with the AAPI Community in confronting the racism and injustice that is being perpetrated against the AAPI Community. Racism and hatred are wrong periodt!
