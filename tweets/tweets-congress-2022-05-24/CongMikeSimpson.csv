CongMikeSimpson,Biden’s “incredible transition” is crushing American families.  
CongMikeSimpson,Happy Armed Forces Day to all those who have served our great country. God bless you all 🇺🇸🇺🇸 
CongMikeSimpson,Today marks 11 days straight of record high gas prices. Daily life is far more expensive today than it was on Jan 20 2021 and Democrats refuse to do what is necessary to build domestic energy production.
CongMikeSimpson,Irresponsible federal spending is one of the drivers of #Bidenflation. The Democrats bill shows that the Administration just wants to continue the same failed policies that are hurting American families.
CongMikeSimpson,The Biden Administration is currently sitting on $1 billion of appropriated funds to address supply chain issues that the FDA could use for the formula crisis. But instead they want another $28 million for “salaries and expenses.”
CongMikeSimpson,Congratulations to James and Luke from Timberline High — they finished 2nd in the cyber security award at the 2022 Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair. What an exciting accomplishment! 
CongMikeSimpson,After only a few weeks since it was first announced Biden’s ‘Disinformation Governance Board’ is being paused. Simply put the federal government has no business being the arbiter of truth and the American people are better off without this Board in place.
CongMikeSimpson,1 in 5 people experience a mental health condition. Taking care of your mental health is important and Idahoans can find resources to help them do that. #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth
