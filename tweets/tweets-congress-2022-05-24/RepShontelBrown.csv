RepShontelBrown,I am horrified and heart broken by the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Texas.I am also angry. Angry that 14 children—14 innocent children—and their teacher lost their lives to gun violence that we have the power to do something about.Enough is enough.
RepShontelBrown,A good and faithful public servant Bill Denihan devoted his life to improving the lives of all people in our Cleveland community.His legacy will live on through the countless lives he touched.Sending my condolences to his wife Mary and his family.
RepShontelBrown,Thank you @POTUS for working around-the-clock to address the infant formula shortage.We need to move heaven &amp; earth to get formula back on shelves.That's why I am glad the House passed $28 million in emergency funding to address the formula shortage last week.

RepShontelBrown,50% of baby formula is purchased using WIC.And 89% percent of WIC participants purchase formula from Abbott whose closed plant sparked the shortage.The House passed a bill yesterday to support low-income families who rely on WIC by improving their access to formula products.
RepShontelBrown,Together with the Infrastructure Law the COMPETES Act will ensure more goods are made in America and get them to market faster. 
RepShontelBrown,Frustrated by rising gas prices?So am I. Today the House passed new legislation that would establish the first ever federal law against price gouging by oil and gas companies.
RepShontelBrown,From the bomb threats targeting HBCUs earlier this year to this weekend’s racist shooting in Buffalo domestic terrorism is on the rise nationwide. Last night the House passed legislation to strengthen the federal government's response to hate-fueled violent extremism.
RepShontelBrown,I am extremely concerned that families are struggling to find baby formula.This a crisis that Congress can and must address.Today I will vote for 2 bills to provide emergency funding to ease the shortage and improve WIC participants' access to formula.
RepShontelBrown,Thank you @Richmond46 for your service and your tireless work on behalf of the American people. 
RepShontelBrown,Yesterday Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis celebrated 200 years of partnership between Greece and the U.S. in a joint meeting of Congress. His words served as a powerful reminder of why we must strengthen and protect democracy in the face of global threats. 
RepShontelBrown,For 25 years the @NewDemCoalition has worked to deliver key wins—from the ACA to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. As a member I'm proud of the work the New Dems do to cut through gridlock in Washington and deliver real results for the American people.
RepShontelBrown,We used to celebrate infrastructure week.Now we are celebrating the beginning of an infrastructure decade.Just 6 months after it was signed into law by @POTUS the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has delivered $3B to Ohio to repair roads bridges railways and water systems.
RepShontelBrown,Workers need new skills to compete in the modern economy. That’s why I voted for legislation today that will help workers gain the skills they need to access better-paying jobs in high-demand occupations. #InvestinginWorkers
