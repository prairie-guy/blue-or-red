GerryConnolly,Is this the price we are willing to pay for the @NRA‚Äôs greed? Are we really willing to send our kids to die at their desks because the @GOP is too pathetic and scared to act?This is madness.
GerryConnolly,I am heartbroken. Again we must grieve for children killed and wounded in the place they should feel most safe. This madness must end. 
GerryConnolly,This from the man who gave us Pol Pot Pinochet and a phony peace agreement after prolonging the Vietnam war by five years.

GerryConnolly,If you don‚Äôt like abortion don‚Äôt have an abortion. If you don‚Äôt like gay marriage don‚Äôt have a gay wedding.The world will not stop turning because people live their lives differently than you do.
GerryConnolly,On behalf of the US Delegation to NATO PA I convened an emergency meeting this morning with our Ukrainian colleague Yehor Cherniev to discuss urgent requests for assistance to help defend Ukrainian territory and ship agricultural products. #StandWithUkraineÔ∏è
GerryConnolly,It turns out ‚ÄúLock Her Up‚Äù was just their plan for women who have miscarriages.

GerryConnolly,‚ÄúWe urge the Administration and United States Senate to work together and with our NATO Allies to advance immediately the accession protocols authorizing @NATO membership for #Finland and #Sweden.‚ÄùRead the letter I sent with nearly 200 of my colleagues:
GerryConnolly,Well I‚Äôve been banned from Russia. And I was so looking forward to my skiing trip in Siberia.#SlavaUkraini 
GerryConnolly,Happy to have joined in celebration for the Korean Bell Garden‚Äôs 10th anniversary! The Bell of ‚ÄúPeace and Harmony‚Äù commemorates equality opportunity and freedom. Let this serve as a reminder of the peace and harmony that exists between all of us in our multicultural community. 
GerryConnolly,Thank you @FACETSCares for having me this evening! My experience with FACETS while serving in local government has helped shape who I am as a public servant. I‚Äôm honored to be a partner in Congress for FACETS and support their strong community services. 
GerryConnolly,Delighted to be with @VP Harris @EPAMichaelRegan and so many friends at Meridian High School in Falls Church today to announce $500 million in new funding for electric school buses from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law! 
GerryConnolly,Many times these cases are not willful crimes. These penalties are a cheap easy way of getting enforcement up. Its unconscionable to pile fines on these people. 
GerryConnolly,.@POTUS just announced the first flight as part of Operation Fly Formula! The equivalent of 1.5 million bottles of Nestle baby formula will soon be en route to the US from Switzerland ‚Äî with millions more to come.
GerryConnolly,@AOC Congratulations! Wishing you both all the best üéâ
GerryConnolly,Republicans spent a week ranting and raving about the formula shortage but they don‚Äôt care about your kids. They just need a distraction from coverage of their support for extreme white nationalist ideologies.Only 12 of them voted to actually fix the shortage. 
GerryConnolly,Leadership.This paired with the legislation @HouseDemocrats will pass tonight will be a huge relief for families across the country.Thank you @POTUS. 
GerryConnolly,Col. Yevgeny Vindman is a true public servant. He has more patriotism in his pinky finger than Donald Trump will ever have. As the Pentagon IG has now confirmed he deserved none of the retaliatory vitriol thrown at him by the former president and his team. 
GerryConnolly,Republicans want to force our daughters to live with fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers had.It's reprehensible and un-American and we will not stand for it.#ProtectRoe
GerryConnolly,Amidst infant formula shortages across the country families are going to bed wondering how they will get their babies the food they need.Today @HouseDemocrats will pass a bill to help #FeedOurInfants by providing the FDA with the resources it needs to address this shortage. 
GerryConnolly,#HeadStart has provided critical support to families and children across the nation. Thank you for going the extra mile to continue our mission of preparing America‚Äôs young children to succeed in school and in life. #HappyBdayHeadStart
