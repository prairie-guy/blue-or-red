SenBooker,Help is on the way for our families. Thank you @POTUS for your leadership in addressing the baby formula shortage.

SenBooker,I’ve seen firsthand how the Brownfields program revitalizes communities. I was proud to join @DonaldNorcross @VicCarstarphen @shawnlatur and others to celebrate the restoration of Camden’s Brownfield sites made possible by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. 
SenBooker,The Taiwanese community and every community deserves better than having their lives broken by gun violence and hate. We must act to affirm our commitment to combating the rising tide of violence against Asian-Americans.And may we always remember the heroes.
