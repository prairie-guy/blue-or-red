RepHuizenga,Agreed @CandylovesPete but what happens when a federal court and the ACLU steps in and says “that isn’t fair” therefore the ballots must be counted?? 
RepHuizenga,By overturning PA st law &amp; court precedent this ruling fuels speculation of a broken voting system: Federal appeals court says undated Pa. mail ballots should be counted a decision that breaks with state courts and could have immediate impact 
RepHuizenga,Just as bad @elonmusk is when publicly traded companies are forced by new @SECGov rules to disclose information that isn’t relevant or material to their operations… if they can even track it. Oil company? Material info. Car company? Maybe. Social media company?Not material.
