SenatorRomney,Expanding @NATO to include Finland and Sweden will send a clear message to Putin and to any leader that attempts to follow his path that the free world is unified and stands ready to defend its values and sovereignty. 
SenatorRomney,The U.S. and our @NATO allies must be prepared for Putin’s worst weapons. Russia should have no doubt that our answer to an act so heinous and geopolitically disorienting would be devastating. 
SenatorRomney,Russia’s use of a nuclear weapon would be a redefining geopolitical event. Any nation that chose to retain ties with Russia would see its economy severed from that of the U.S. and our allies—a devastating consequence given that the West represents over half of the global GDP. 
SenatorRomney,When it comes to Vladimir Putin we should imagine the unimaginable specifically how we would respond militarily and economically to such a seismic shift in the global geopolitical terrain. 
SenatorRomney,The perpetrators of the CCP’s systematic campaign to erase the Uyghurs and other ethnic &amp; religious minorities must be held to account. @UNHumanRights must have unfettered access to investigate these crimes &amp; document any attempts to limit/control access. 
SenatorRomney,This is the right decision—keeping Title 42 in place has bipartisan support. It’s time that the Biden Administration gets serious about solving the illegal immigration crisis at our southern border. 
SenatorRomney,Ukrainians are fighting for their freedom while being brutally violated by Russia. I will be voting for the Ukraine bill because it is in America’s interest to do so. And it is also simply the right thing to do. I am proud to stand with the freedom-loving people of Ukraine. 
SenatorRomney,If the Administration decides to cancel nearly $2 trillion in student loan debt it would be wholly unfair to those who already repaid their loans or decided to pursue alternative education paths. Our bill prevents the President from taking this action. 
SenatorRomney,Spending $40 billion to help Ukraine defeat Russia is one of the smartest most economic investments we could make. War is bad for everyone even here in America: it interrupts the supply chain raises the price of oil and the products Americans buy and it roils capital markets. 
SenatorRomney,Cancelling nearly $2 trillion in student loan debt would be wildly inflationary at a time of already historic inflation. It makes no sense at all! While the President’s legal authority here is dubious at best our bill would prevent him from taking action. 
SenatorRomney,It is in the best interest of America to see Ukraine succeed and Russia fail. If Russia wins this won't be the last time it invades a neighbor. Stronger nuclear nations will be emboldened to invade and oppress other sovereign nations. Russia winning is a win for authoritarians.
