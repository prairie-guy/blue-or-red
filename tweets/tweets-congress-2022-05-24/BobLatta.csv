BobLatta,Joining @gopleader @ohioag and @repbalderson to discuss the scourge of fentanyl in our communities. 
BobLatta,Since day one instead of increasing domestic oil &amp; gas production the Biden Admin has pushed policies that have restricted these resources. We are seeing the results at the gas pump. The solution is to focus on energy policies that will empower N. American energy independence. 
BobLatta,Fentanyl has taken countless lives and leaves grieving families in its wake. No community is safe including in #OH05.  In 2020 89% of overdose fatalities in Lucas County were directly related to fentanyl poisonings according to the @ToledoLucasHD. 
BobLatta,A federal judge ruled yesterday that Title 42 which was set to expire on Monday will remain in place for the time being. This is a great victory in securing our border and is the only thing stemming the flow of migrants across our southern border. 
BobLatta,Today Todd completes his internship in my Washington D.C. office. He has served in the 148th Infantry Regiment of the @OHNationalGuard &amp; is currently finishing a Master's in Public Admin at @bgsu. We wish Todd all the best &amp; thank him for his service to Ohio’s 5th District! 
BobLatta,In 2020 the egg industry was responsible for as much as $3.22 billion in total economic activity throughout the state of Ohio creating or supporting as many as 14438 total jobs.
BobLatta,I had a great meeting with #OH5 members of the @UnitedEggProd yesterday. We discussed agriculture labor issues food labeling concerns and the highly pathogenic avian influenza. 
BobLatta,This week U.S. authorities announced they have found yet another way that drug cartels have been smuggling drugs and migrants across our southern border.  We must secure our border from all vantage points - including below ground. 
BobLatta,Energy prices continue to surge across the country and according to @EIAgov summer electric bills are predicted to increase by 3.9%.We must UNLEASH North American energy production to bring prices down! 
BobLatta,Inflation was not and is not 'transitory'. It has a firm grip on our economy and it is not relenting anytime soon. ▪️ 40-year high▪️ Weighing down weekly budgets▪️ $5000 extra costs per year to American families
BobLatta,I urge my colleagues to support legislation like the American Energy Independence from Russia Act introduced by Republican Leaders @cathymcmorris and @RepWesterman which will unlock North American energy and provide relief to Americans at the pump.
BobLatta,.@POTUS has made every effort to undermine avoid &amp; restrict oil &amp; gas production in N. America. My constituents in #OH5 are paying the highest prices ever at the pump. Instead of taking responsibility @POTUS has worked w/ House Dems to again shift the blame through this bill. 
BobLatta,.@DHSgov announced today that their so-called 'Disinformation Board' will be put on the back burner after an outcry from those concerned about govt. censorship – including criticisms from civil liberties and human rights orgs. This is a win for Americans &amp; the First Amendment! 
BobLatta,Border encounters are once again off the charts with 234088 migrant encounters during the month of April. @CBP is already seeing around 7400 migrants each day in May - if that trend continues May encounters will once again top 230K. 
BobLatta,Small businesses across the country are struggling to keep their doors open due to rapidly increasing inflation supply chain issues &amp; labor shortages. We MUST focus on common sense economic policies to help relieve these burdens on our families and neighbors. 
BobLatta,According to @GLFOP police officer shootings are⬆️38% compared to this time in '20. Simultaneously homicide rates are⬆️48% compared to the same time period. The #crimecrisis is yet another crisis that is plaguing the U.S. We must continue to support our men &amp; women in blue.
