BennieGThompson,
BennieGThompson,Today the House takes action to stop Big Oil from #RippingOffAmericans and help lower prices at the pump by:âœ… Ending price gougingâœ… Penalizing market manipulatorsâœ… Bringing transparency to this secretive market
BennieGThompson,Happy 25th Anniversary to the New Democrat Coalition! ðŸŽ‰ 
BennieGThompson,Going to the grocery store &amp; seeing empty shelves with no infant formula in sight is distressing for any parent. @HouseDemocrats &amp; I are voting for a bill that will help #FeedOurInfants by providing the FDA with the resources it needs to address this shortage.
