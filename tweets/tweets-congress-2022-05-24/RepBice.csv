RepBice,My heart goes out to the families and the community of Uvalde Texas in light of today's tragic events. I've reached out to my colleague @RepTonyGonzales to offer any assistance or support that he may need.
RepBice,Relentless record-high gas prices and skyrocketing inflation are hurting American families now and will continue to in the future.There are devastating consequences of failed policies under one-party Democrat rule.
RepBice,Excited for the bright minds of #OK05 students to participate in the #CongressionalAppChallenge - a competition that encourages learning how to code and shows the value of computer science and STEM.Click the link for more info and to preregister ‚¨áÔ∏è 
RepBice,The strengthening of ties between Russia and China is alarming. The United States must pursue a policy of peace through strength to deter our near-peer adversaries. Sadly the world is less safe under the Biden administration.
RepBice,Instead of a temporary bandage that will have no lasting effect Biden should work to address the underlying roots of this crisis. He should reverse his anti-American energy policies and restore American energy independence. 
RepBice,Today we honor all branches of the U.S. military who each specialize in protecting our great nation. We are forever grateful for their relentless dedication to serving our country and keeping us safe. I will always support our brave men and women in service in #OK05 and beyond. 
RepBice,.@RepFeenstra and I recently spoke on our legislation the Formula Act. Check it out üëá 
RepBice,My friend @RepArmstrongND is 100% right. This legislation will not solve the issues that are negatively affecting Americans. We must restore American energy independence. 
RepBice,üö® The #BidenBorderCrisis hit an all-time high. üö® There were 234088 migrants encountered at the southern border in April - the highest number in @DHSgov history - with 117989 released into the U.S.A country without secure borders is not a country.
RepBice,Why is the Biden Admin continuing their anti-American energy policies by relying on corrupt socialist countries like Venezuela? We should be producing here at home in states like Oklahoma to lower the crushing price of gas for American families.
RepBice,I spoke in strong opposition to the Socialist Energy Price Fixing Act which casts blame on hard working Americans in the energy industry by establishing de facto price controls on fuels. This will create fuel shortages and increase dependence on foreign energy.Watch below üîΩüîΩ 
RepBice,It is critical that we solve the baby formula crisis hold the Biden admin accountable and ensure this will not happen again. Proud to introduce the Babies Need Formula Now Act with @RepStefanik @cathymcmorris &amp; @RepAshleyHinson. Read more in @FoxNews üëá
RepBice,.@GOPLeader is right. Rising gas prices and inflation are hurting hard-working Oklahomans costing them thousands more. Instead of shifting blame we need to find tangible solutions for these crises. 
RepBice,üìù Check out my weekly column on the distressing baby formula shortage:  
RepBice,Last week I visited Seminole in #OK05 to see firsthand the storm damage. I met with local leaders and Seminole residents to learn more about the situation and see how my staff and I can continue to provide assistance after the devastating tornadoes. 
RepBice,This is a big win for the country. @HouseGOP will always stand for freedom of speech and against this Orwellian attempt by the Biden admin. 
RepBice,Yet another record by the Biden admin. We must restore policies that allowed America to be energy independent just 2 years ago. It's simple. Let states like Oklahoma increase production and meet our nation's needs. This ultimately will lower fuel prices.
