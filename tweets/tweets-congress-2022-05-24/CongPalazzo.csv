CongPalazzo,Thank you @TSA @Idemia_NA and @FlyGPT for letting me join the unveiling of the new TSA Precheck In-Journey here in Gulfport! 
CongPalazzo,She couldn’t even keep a straight face with this absurd statement. This country needs to return to Christian values now more than ever before.

CongPalazzo,Thanks to everyone who has reached out to my office about the formula shortage. I’m happy to see the successes we’ve had so far. While we can’t guarantee specific formulas we are working hard to get parents in touch with manufacturers. Please call 601-582-3246 for assistance.
