RepBlakeMoore,With all that's at stake we cannot compromise our efforts towards energy independence or exacerbate the financial crisis of American families across the nation. #utpol
RepBlakeMoore,Last week I joined 50 of my colleagues to urge the @USTreasury against implementing a windfall profits tax on American oil and gas producers. 
RepBlakeMoore,Companies like Matia are changing people's lives and it was a privilege to learn about their impactful work. #utpol
RepBlakeMoore,Yesterday I visited @MatiaRobotics a team of expert engineers dedicated to creating innovative robotic mobility products. They design technology that enhance the lives of individuals with walking disabilities so they have more housing options and mobility independence. 
RepBlakeMoore,My visit to the Catalyst Center in Kaysville made me excited about the great educational opportunities my boys will have when they reach high school. The dynamic skills-based training they offer their students is exceptional and exactly what our education system needs. #utpol 
RepBlakeMoore,Today we recognize #ArmedForcesDay and the Americans who devote their lives to defending our freedom. We are grateful for your service! #utpol 
RepBlakeMoore,"While I'm relieved to see it paused it is still incredibly worrisome that a communist-style ""Ministry of Truth"" was even considered by this administration. #utpol"
RepBlakeMoore,"One of the biggest flops or unforced errors we've seen from the Biden Admin was to even propose this nonsensical ""disinformation governance board"" that even many Dems found ridiculous. I signed a letter to @DHSgov weeks ago raising ethical concerns."
RepBlakeMoore,If the Biden Administration is so sure unleashing domestic energy production would not solve our skyrocketing gas prices and national security concerns Americans deserve to know why. #utpol Read more about the Protecting American Energy Act here:
RepBlakeMoore,I introduced the Protecting American Energy Act which will ensure domestic energy production can continue w/o political interference &amp; hold the admin accountable as we seek to understand their unwillingness to work w/ domestic energy producers on solutions to our energy crises.
RepBlakeMoore,Link to admendments here:
RepBlakeMoore,Two of my amendments that would lower gas prices for Utahns and bolster domestic energy production were blocked by Democrats today. Our crippling energy prices are directly hurting Utahns and we need action now. #utpol
