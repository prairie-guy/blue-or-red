RepSamGraves,For years I’ve talked about the importance of prioritizing people’s lives and livelihoods when it comes to managing our rivers. This year’s bipartisan Water Resources Development Act takes a big step forward in doing just that. 
RepSamGraves,Far too many rural hospitals are on the brink of extinction. My Save America’s Rural Hospitals Act will help put them back on solid ground so they can continue caring for our communities. 
RepSamGraves,It’s critical to make sure the Corps does not lose focus of its navigation and flood control responsibilities and the Water Resources Development Act of 2022 does just that. This is a good bipartisan bill and I’m glad to see it moving forward.
