RepRitchie,Just 10 days ago we lost 10 New Yorkers to gun violence. And today 14 children will not come home from elementary school. Gun violence is an epidemic in this country. It is long past time for meaningful gun reform to finally put a stop to this unrelenting violence.
RepRitchie,With one in four Bronx residents experiencing food insecurity it is critical that SNAP benefits are properly and fully funded. Proud to join @HungerFreeUSA @bronxbp and @AmandaFariasNYC for this important event to highlight anti hunger programs for New Yorkers. 
RepRitchie,It was an honor to join @JCRCNY today for their 58th annual #CelebrateIsraelParade. A unique opportunity for New Yorkers of all backgrounds to unite in their support for Israel. 
RepRitchie,Earlier this month I passed a bill will allows @usfire to translate lessons learned into actual policies and practices that will prevent fires and save lives. This is the first step of many in ensuring everyone is safe from the threat of fire no matter their zip code. 
RepRitchie,A look at what I along with my colleagues @HouseDemocrats  accomplished this week in Washington DC #ForThePeople: 
RepRitchie,Proud to have partnered with @UAEEmbassyUS @NYCParks and @NYCFC to bring this soccer field to life in Crotona Park. I look forward to seeing the lasting impact this park has on our community here in the #Bronx. 
RepRitchie,Babies can’t wait. Families need relief. That’s why last night I voted to pass @RepJahanaHayes’ #AccesstoBabyFormulaAct to provide urgent relief to American families in need.
RepRitchie,The attack in Buffalo adds to a growing list of hate crimes against Black Americans since 2020. As we mourn we must confront the legacy of racist housing policies that facilitate residential segregation &amp; enable targeted violence like we saw in Buffalo.
