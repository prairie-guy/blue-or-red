SenLummis,Gas prices won’t come down if we don’t make actual effort to unleash American energy. Happy to join @SenJohnBarrasso to fight for Wyoming and our energy industry with the Lease Now Act and the ONSHORE Act.
SenLummis,Grateful to the @DigitalChamber for hosting @SenGillibrand and I today. Digital assets are non-partisan so it’s important that any framework governing them is bipartisan. 
SenLummis,Thank you to The @Heritage Foundation for inviting me to join their panel on “Bitcoin and the American Experiment.” So great to join @CaitlinLong_ and @saylor to discuss the future of Bitcoin in our American financial system. 
SenLummis,I met with the Wyoming Association of General Contractors last week and they shared the struggle they’ve had securing construction materials to complete projects. When they do get the materials they’re paying insanely high prices. Inflation is hurting people all across Wyoming.
SenLummis,Thrilled to see my dear friend Ogden Driskill and his family inducted into the WY Cowboy Hall of Fame this year. Ogden embodies the cowboy way of life and his contributions to NE WY and the state at large make him more than deserving of this honor. 
SenLummis,Crypto has made unlikely allies of two US Senators who say regulation is needed now more than ever after recent market turmoil  via @bpolitics
SenLummis,Due to inflation Wyoming families will pay close to $5200 more this year on goods they use every single day. 
SenLummis,My statement on the Ukraine supplemental vote today: 
SenLummis,People all across Wyoming invested their hard-earned dollars in major companies across the U.S. yet their voices are being co-opted by financial advisers with a partisan agenda. I joined @SenDanSullivan to make sure people in Wyoming have a voice in the companies they invest in. 
SenLummis,Homeland Security officials don’t have the resources they need to protect our borders. They’re so busy trying to slow the flow of migrants coming in over the border that criminals constructed tunnels right under their feet. 
SenLummis,Just because you say “free” over and over again doesn’t mean there’s not a price tag.
