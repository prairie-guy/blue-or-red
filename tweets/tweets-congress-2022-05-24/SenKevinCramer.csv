SenKevinCramer,Met Dori Carlson Leslie Hellebush and Nancy Kopp members of the North Dakota Optometric Association to discuss important optometric legislation. Thankful they presented me the AOA 2022 Healthcare Leadership Award for my work in Congress supporting our healthcare industry. 
SenKevinCramer,Discussed the future of the Republican party and the Biden Administration‚Äôs disastrous energy policy with @larry_kudlow on @FoxBusiness. Watch ‚¨áÔ∏è 
SenKevinCramer,Good news ‚Äì after heavy backlash the Biden Administration is reportedly pausing its Orwellian Disinformation Governance Board at @DHSgov. The Board was unconstitutional to begin with and it‚Äôs about time it disbanded once and for all. 
SenKevinCramer,Wonderful to celebrate Majority Leader Dick Armey‚Äôs book release for his memoir ‚ÄúLeader.‚Äù It‚Äôs written so literally in his voice you almost hear his deep gravely tones as you read every sentence. He‚Äôs every bit Texan as he is North Dakotan and a principled political leader. 
SenKevinCramer,Like the rest of the country North Dakota is suffering from a shortage of baby formula. @NDDOH is being proactive and can be a valuable resource for families looking for help.Click below to find resources ‚¨áÔ∏è
SenKevinCramer,In this week‚Äôs newsletter: a bipartisan policymaker conversation on energy and inflation with @SenatorHick and the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Minneapolis @POTUS‚Äô baby formula shortage and questions for @USFWS on the flawed 30x30 plan. Read üì∞ 
SenKevinCramer,Wow. He can‚Äôt possibly be this ignorant which means he‚Äôs willing to perpetuate a lie to provide cover for an administration that is this ignorant. 
SenKevinCramer,Today we celebrate our strong and courageous military! As we work on writing next year‚Äôs NDAA I promise to fight to ensure our military members have the right resources to properly do their jobs and keep America safe. 
SenKevinCramer,What kind of a person even thinks like this much less says it out loud? 
SenKevinCramer,The Courts are once again getting it right. The U.S. is in the midst of the greatest border crisis in our history thanks to @POTUS' destructive policies. @CBP agents need every tool including Title 42 as they work to end the chaos at our border. 
SenKevinCramer,Three million immigrants have illegally crossed the border since Biden took office. If Title 42 is lifted it‚Äôs projected there will be one million more illegal crossings in the next six weeks. It makes no sense for @POTUS to get rid of this vital tool.
SenKevinCramer,Thanks to Polish Minister Piotr Naimski for discussing nuclear energy and opportunities to work together to advance clean reliable energy. Increasing nuclear energy will provide Poland reliable baseload power reduce emissions and counter Russia‚Äôs malign influence. 
SenKevinCramer,2021 had the highest number of police officers intentionally killed in the line of duty since 9/11. This is a problem. I'm glad the Senate passed a resolution reiterating our support of the brave men and women in law enforcement. 
SenKevinCramer,It‚Äôs unacceptable the FDA and key officials in the Biden Administration did not anticipate this crisis. Abbott Nutrition holds 48.1% of the U.S. market in infant formula. @POTUS should‚Äôve taken immediate action as soon as a voluntary recall was issued.
SenKevinCramer,American moms and families deserve answers from the @FDA on its activities which may have contributed to the exacerbated infant formula shortages. 
SenKevinCramer,It‚Äôs long past time for the Biden Administration to combat the spike in crime as violence skyrockets across the country.I joined @SenBillCassidy on a resolution to keep our communities and law enforcement safe and supported. 
SenKevinCramer,At a Senate @EPWGOP hearing I pressed @USFWS Director Martha Williams on the Biden Administration‚Äôs expansive 30x30 agenda and the flawed appeals process for Waterfowl Production Area easements. Watch ‚¨áÔ∏è 
SenKevinCramer,Gas prices are through the roof. As summer road trip season begins and the Biden Administration keeps pushing inflationary policies this could only get worse. Stop pushing Venezuelan oil when we have it here! 
SenKevinCramer,Thank you Missile Defense Agency Director Vice Admiral Jon Hill for visiting about our advanced weapons systems opportunities in space defense and modernization of assets at North Dakota‚Äôs Cavalier Space Force Station. 
SenKevinCramer,The United States is in the midst of the greatest border crisis in our history yet the Biden Administration still plans to end Title 42 a vital tool for our border patrol agents as they work to control the southern border crisis. @POTUS ‚Äì do the right thing and extend Title 42.
SenKevinCramer,.@AXPC_US joined me to discuss the geopolitical opportunity at our hands when it comes to energy. We need to be producing American energy exporting LNG to Europe streamlining permitting processes and pushing @POTUS to send positive market signals to industry. 
SenKevinCramer,It was good to speak with Donn Diederich with @AGCofND about implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law and the significance of this investment for North Dakota. We also discussed the best ways to address the labor workforce shortages occurring across the nation.
