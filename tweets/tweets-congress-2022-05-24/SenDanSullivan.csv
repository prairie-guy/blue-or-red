SenDanSullivan,It‚Äôs always the highlight of my day getting to meet with young Alaskans especially hearing about their hopes and plans the future. Thank you to the moms and dads teachers and chaperones for making meaningful experiences like this possible! 
SenDanSullivan,Students from Anchor Lutheran School in Anchorage joined me in the big atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building‚Äîpart of their school tour of American historic sites up and down the East Coast. 
SenDanSullivan,It‚Äôs disturbing that the Administration appears to be doing exactly what the Chinese Communist Party wants ‚Äì economically isolating Taiwan. Instead of isolating Taiwan the Biden Administration should be supporting this important island democracy.
SenDanSullivan,I have been encouraging senior Biden Administration officials for months not to leave Taiwan out of the Indo-Pacific Trade Pact. This is a strategic mistake that signals to Beijing they can call the shots economically in the Indo-Pacific. 
SenDanSullivan,I‚Äôve heard from senior Japanese officials that White House Climate Czar John Kerry has *discouraged* them from importing clean-burning U.S. LNG. Whose side is this guy on?In @SASCGOP I asked Biden‚Äôs Energy Secretary Granholm if she agrees üëá 
SenDanSullivan,Our INDEX Act is quite simple. It just says that the beneficial owner who owns the shares is the entity or person entitled to vote‚Äînot the managers of these massive passive index funds. 
SenDanSullivan,More on the INDEX Act ‚û°Ô∏è  
SenDanSullivan,More than 60% of Americans want to produce more U.S. oil &amp; gas. But Wall Street disagrees and is hijacking millions of Americans‚Äô investments to blackball the energy sector. 
SenDanSullivan,I agree @VivekGRamaswamy. Most Americans are fed up with Woke Inc. especially Wall Street‚Äôs reckless black-balling of American energy.Appreciate your voice on this &amp; would welcome your support/input on INDEX Act. 
SenDanSullivan,Just because an average American investor may not vote their shares if given the opportunity doesn‚Äôt mean that power should reside with the Big 3 asset firms. As I told @SquawkCNBC in a sense the decision not to vote is a vote in itself‚Äîone that should belong to shareholders. 
SenDanSullivan,A quirk in federal law has allowed the ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù Wall Street asset managers to wield enormous voting power at shareholder meetings where they‚Äôve pushed radical political agendas most Americans oppose. My INDEX Act would fix this massive market distortion. 
SenDanSullivan,Thank you @SenLummis for your support and for your strong advocacy on behalf of everyday American investors. 
SenDanSullivan,The ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù Wall Street firms today are the largest shareholders in over 90% of the S&amp;P. They‚Äôve often used this consolidated power to push political agendas most Americans oppose.My INDEX Act would return the voting power to where it belongs‚Äîwith fund investors not advisers. 
SenDanSullivan,BlackRock State Street &amp; Vanguard  cast about ¬º of all votes at shareholder meetings. Today I introduced the INDEX Act to correct this extreme market distortion and empower investors.Our bill ‚¨áÔ∏è 
SenDanSullivan,Today my colleagues and I introduced the INDEX Act to empower individual investors and foster a healthier more competitive and more democratic corporate governance ecosystem. More details üëá 
SenDanSullivan,I implore Joe Biden to abandon the radical left‚Äôs destructive anti-American energy agenda. There is another way. We can protect the environment AND unleash American energy. Read my American Energy Jobs &amp; Climate plan Mr. President.
