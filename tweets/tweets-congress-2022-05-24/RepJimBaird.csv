RepJimBaird,This is an incredible and exciting investment in our community. 
RepJimBaird,In the month of April alone there were 234088 illegal crossings at our southern border— the worst month on record. DHS released 118000 of those individuals into the U.S. more than were removed.Our southern border certainly doesn’t appear closed. 
RepJimBaird,Today we honor the men and women who proudly serve and defend our country. Happy Armed Forces Day to those who serve across all branches in the U.S. military. 
RepJimBaird,For 11 days in a row Hoosier farmers have been paying record high prices at the pump. This administration’s policies are harming the men and women who help feed and clothe our nation. What is it going to take for President Biden to end his anti-American energy policies? 
RepJimBaird,Title 42 remains one of the few tools our border patrol agents have to manage this administration’s border crisis. I’m glad to see this federal judge  sees the value in maintaining this program. 
RepJimBaird,Great to welcome my fellow #Boilermakers @LifeAtPurdue to the Capitol this week and talk to them about what we’re working on in Congress. 
RepJimBaird,The price of diesel in Lafayette is the highest it's ever been: $5.41 per gallon.  Hoosiers are paying the price for this administration's war on American energy and they've had enough.
RepJimBaird,Honored to spend part of my afternoon yesterday with Hoosier heroes participating in the #HonorFlight. This is such a special tradition and it’s great to be able to thank our Veterans and welcome them to our nation’s capital.
