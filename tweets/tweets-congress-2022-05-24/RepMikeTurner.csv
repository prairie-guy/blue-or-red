RepMikeTurner,Read our full release here: 
RepMikeTurner,In 2021 the FBI conducted over 3.3 million US persons FISA queries-more the double the amount of 2020. This raises significant questions which is why @Jim_Jordan and I are demanding full transparency and cooperation as we determine the cause of this dramatic increase. 
RepMikeTurner,Glad to welcome my colleague and friend @GOPLeader to @WrightPattAFB to receive a national security briefing at NASIC. We will continue to support and advocate for the men and women at Wright-Patterson.
RepMikeTurner,Today is National Armed Forces Day. Join me in recognizing the men and women from all military branches who serve our country at home or overseas. Though your uniforms may be different you have the same mission: defend the homeland. Thank You. 
RepMikeTurner,May is Jewish American Heritage Month. This week I had the honor of speaking at the Annual Jewish American Heritage Month Celebration where we honored the invaluable contributions Jewish Americans make to our communities every day. 
RepMikeTurner,As members of NATO Finland and Sweden would enhance the military capabilities of the alliance and serve to increase the deterrent effect of the alliance against an increasingly aggressive Russia.Read my full letter with @GerryConnolly here:
RepMikeTurner,The Disinformation Governance Board was only successful in reinforcing that the Department of Homeland Security's priorities are severely misplaced.
RepMikeTurner,The suspension of the DHS Disinformation Governance Board is by far the best decision thatâ€™s been made when it comes to this Orwellian entity. Read my full joint statement with @RepJohnKatko:  
RepMikeTurner,President Biden continues to break records just not the right ones. Gas prices hit another record high this morning rising 4 cents just overnight. The solution is simple- reinstate domestic oil production and instead set the record for American energy independence.
RepMikeTurner,200K+ immigrants crossed our border illegally in the month of April. Failure to know who is entering our country is a national security threat. An overwhelmed border is an unsafe border.
