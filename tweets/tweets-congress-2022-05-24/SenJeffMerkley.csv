SenJeffMerkley,For everyone whose life has been torn apart by gun violence for all those grieving the loss of someone important in their life and for all those living in fear of gun violence—we need to reform the filibuster and get gun safety reforms passed and signed into law. Now.
SenJeffMerkley,Horrifying. The epidemic of gun violence rips communities apart and slaughters our children. Hard to find the words to express the grief at seeing another mass shooting in our country. 
SenJeffMerkley,We need the Biden Administration to strongly enforce the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act when it goes into effect next month and we must continue to work to prevent human rights abuses wherever they arise.
SenJeffMerkley,China is committing blatant human rights abuses and genocide. This is a deeply disturbing read—but the faces and the stories of Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities being decimated by China in Xinjiang are not something we can look away from. 
SenJeffMerkley,We’ve made great strides in the past few years but there’s more work to be done to make sure that everyone in our country has access to the health care they need—mental and physical. I’ll keep working to make that a reality.
SenJeffMerkley,Thank you for sharing your story @SenTinaSmith. I encourage everyone to give it a read. 
SenJeffMerkley,I am following CDC guidance and isolating while continuing to work for Oregonians from my home in Portland. Once it is safe I will resume meeting in person and will return to Washington DC for Senate duties.
SenJeffMerkley,
SenJeffMerkley,We need to #CancelStudentDebt. 
SenJeffMerkley,Canceling student debt isn’t a radical proposal. It’s radical to continue to saddle generation after generation with crushing debt.#CancelStudentDebt
SenJeffMerkley,Canceling student debt will help working families in red states and in blue states—it’s about leveling the playing field for folks in Oregon and across the country. I will keep pushing to #CancelStudentDebt and open the doors of opportunity to everyone.
SenJeffMerkley,50000 lives saved every year.$600 billion in health benefits every year.Transitioning to renewable energy is a public health imperative.This is just one reason why I’m fighting for bold transformative climate action.
SenJeffMerkley,Read our full letter urging a global transition to clean energy ⬇️ 
SenJeffMerkley,.@RepHuffman @marietouss1 and I are leading a trans-Atlantic effort to push for a just transition to our renewable energy future and stop new fossil fuel infrastructure. This is a climate crisis and there’s no time to waste in breaking our dependence on fossil fuels.
SenJeffMerkley,The infrastructure bill is making waves in Tillamook Bay! Wonderful to be at the Port of Garibaldi last weekend to discuss the $62 million @RonWyden and I secured in the Senate for critical repairs to the South Jetty—a win for the local economy and the safety of the community. 
SenJeffMerkley,Great to meet Bridget Brink and congratulate her on yesterday’s confirmation as Ambassador to Ukraine! She is clear-eyed about the enormous challenges ahead but will bring incredible experience courage and dedication as our emissary in Kyiv. 
SenJeffMerkley,This. People should come before corporate profits every time. We need more competition in these and other markets. 
SenJeffMerkley,BREAKING: The Senate just passed vital humanitarian economic and military aid for Ukraine. It’s crucial to support the people of Ukraine as Russia continues its unprovoked barbaric invasion.
SenJeffMerkley,Repression and persecution of dissidents and exiles abroad by authoritarian governments must be stopped. We need to do more to hold actors like China accountable for their bullying and intimidation while helping to protect those who are being targeted. 
SenJeffMerkley,Congress must act on gun violence and aggressively confront the white supremacist terrorism that fuels racist violence. I will continue to fight for meaningful legislation on gun safety reform and to hold perpetrators of white supremacist violence accountable.
SenJeffMerkley,MAGA politicians who gin up hate and parrot white supremacist “replacement theory” for political gain should be held responsible for the violence they inspire. I hope the American people will choose leaders who encourage understanding and dialogue instead.
SenJeffMerkley,White supremacist violence is domestic terrorism. Period. We need to recognize this and hold those committing horrific violence in the name of white supremacy accountable.
SenJeffMerkley,Finally! Congratulations on this overdue victory @uswnt—you’re role models on and off the field. 
SenJeffMerkley,HUGE. Thank you @POTUS for taking these two crucial steps to address the dire formula shortage and get those store shelves full again! 
SenJeffMerkley,@RepBonamici Learn more about the Alan Reinstein Ban Asbestos Now Act ⬇️
SenJeffMerkley,We’ve known for generations that asbestos is lethal yet some industries’ profits have been valued over the lives of firefighters construction workers and other Americans exposed to this toxic substance. @RepBonamici and I are fighting to ban asbestos once and for all. 
SenJeffMerkley,Thrilled to see a Salmon SuperHwy project over the weekend which when complete will remove barriers and reconnect 180 miles of salmon habitat. I’m glad @RonWyden and I secured investments for climate-resilient community-focused projects like this in the spending bill. 
SenJeffMerkley,Had the pleasure to meet with @ZinMarAungNUG yesterday. She's a courageous advocate and I stand with her and the Burmese people in rejecting the military’s coup and brutal tactics. It’s past time to restore Burma’s path to democracy and get aid to the millions of Burmese in need. 
SenJeffMerkley,With cases on the rise across the country getting vaccinated or getting a booster shot can help protect you your loved ones and your community.  Find a vaccine near you: Search    Text your ZIP code to 438829Call 1-800-232-0233
SenJeffMerkley,Big news: the FDA just authorized COVID-19 booster shots for children 5-to-11-years-old.  
SenJeffMerkley,Every person should have a safe stable roof overhead—the folks at Golden Eagle II in Tillamook are making that a reality for our neighbors on the North Coast. Glad @RonWyden and I could secure funding to preserve this important affordable housing complex in the spending package. 
SenJeffMerkley,It’s long past time we stopped letting the gun industry run the Senate. We’ve got to reform the filibuster to pass these critical measures. I will continue to fight to get this done.
SenJeffMerkley,Far too many families and communities have been devastated by gun violence and Congress has failed to enact meaningful commonsense gun safety reforms.
SenJeffMerkley,We all should be able to move freely—to worship to go to the grocery store or to attend school—without fear of gun violence. My heart is with members of Geneva Presbyterian Church Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church and the Taiwanese community targeted by this horrific crime.

SenJeffMerkley,I will keep working in the Senate to make sure everyone has access to affordable top-notch health care—mental and physical. That includes making sure our kids can access the mental health resources they need at school through my bill with @RepKClark.
SenJeffMerkley,May is Mental Health Awareness Month a time to remember that mental health care is health care. We should all have access to the care we need when we’re not well—whether we’re treating our bodies or our brains.
SenJeffMerkley,Today is International Day Against Homophobia Biphobia and Transphobia—an opportunity to recommit ourselves to supporting our LGBTQ+ neighbors and friends and working to build a world where everyone can live as their authentic self without fear of violence or discrimination.
