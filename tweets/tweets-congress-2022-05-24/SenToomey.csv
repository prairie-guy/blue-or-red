SenToomey,Today I join all Americans in mourning those whose lives have been stolen in Uvalde. This tragedy is as horrifying as it is heartbreaking. My deepest condolences are with the families &amp; loved ones of those killed with those who were injured &amp; with the entire state of Texas. 
SenToomey,1 yr + into the Biden admin &amp; not a single free trade negotiation underway. He hasn't lifted 232 tariffs on our allies. He's resisting an exemption process on 301 tariffs for inputs unavailable domestically.This admin has been a complete extension of the last one on trade. 
SenToomey,I rarely agree with @paulkrugman but he's exactly right here: Russia shows why trade surpluses do not equal greater prosperity. The purpose of production is consumption—that applies to trade as well. We export in order to import—lots of both elevates our standard of living. 
SenToomey,This is horrific. Making matters worse is the fact the @usedgov has failed to release their report outlining which states have policies to prevent these educators who engaged in sexual misconduct from moving to other schools. We need that report. We must protect our kids. 
SenToomey,Mark Uyeda is a dedicated public servant and extremely talented securities lawyer with over 25 years of experience—including 15 years of public service at the @SECGov.I'm thrilled to support his nomination and know he is destined to do great things.
