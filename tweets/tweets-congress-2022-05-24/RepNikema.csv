RepNikema,My heart breaks over the news out of Uvalde Texas. As the mom of an elementary school student I will not accept that children and parents continue to live in fear of gun violence at school. Enough is enough. We need to act.
RepNikema,8 months!That's how long it's been since House passed legislation to codify Roe v. Wade and secure equal access to abortion for EVERYONE no matter their ZIP code. It's time for the Senate to step up and pass the Women's Health Protection Act to do the same!
RepNikema,üö®ELECTION DAYüö®Y'all today is a Primary Election Day in Georgia. EVERY vote and EVERY election matters so check your polling location and make a plan to vote today by 7 pm! 
RepNikema,$1.9 TRILLION.That's what Americans owe in student debt. This is a crisis for millions of Americans including a disproportionate number of Black borrowers filling futures with heartache instead of promise. Let's get real: we need to #CancelStudentDebt and put people first!
RepNikema,HISTORY MADE! Spelman College alum Dr. Lisa Cook was sworn in today as the first Black woman to sit on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Making Georgia proud!

RepNikema,An afternoon well spent embracing education and empowerment with @JackandJillGMAC! Always a joy to talk about what it means to live #OutLoudOnPurpose! 
RepNikema,This week the House voted to pass emergency funding to get baby formula back to families stop gas and oil companies from price gouging people at the pump and deal with white supremacy as the domestic terrorist threat that it is. That's what #ForThePeople looks like. 
RepNikema,Today I presented them with a recognition of the Class of 1964 and the award-winning film that I submitted to the Congressional Record. The work of Dr. Thomas and Alvelyn Sanders will be forever honored in Congress.

RepNikema,Hosea Helps (@4hosea) has been changing lives for the last 50 years. Today I was so happy to meet with Miss Omilami and present her and the organization with $2.2 million that I secured from a Community Funding Request. We're going to put that money to work #ForThePeople! 
RepNikema,IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: I'm leading more than 100 of my House colleagues to stand up to the criminalization of reproductive and sexual health care decisions. Every week more states are attacking essential health care and ruining lives. We need to act now! 
RepNikema,I was one of the 34 Members of Congress targeted by Barry Loudermilk's complaint last year. We had asked for an investigation into Capitol tours given on January 5th when tours were shut down because of health concerns. I'm glad we're getting that investigation! Aren't y'all?

RepNikema,Consolidation helps companies not parents and children.We need to get baby formula back in the hands of families and make sure that they can feed their children no matter the age of their child their ZIP code or the size of their bank account. 
RepNikema,Congratulations to @PressSec Karine Jean-Pierre on the end of a tremendous first week on the job! Your barrier-breaking success as the FIRST Black woman and LGBTQ+ person to serve in this role inspires us all every day. We're so so proud. 
RepNikema,I'm always fighting to drive prices down #ForThePeople. Families trying to make ends meet should never have to worry about being ripped off at the gas pump which is why I voted YES today on cracking down on oil and gas companies price gouging consumers.
RepNikema,Last night I voted YES on House action to get baby formula back to families. Any delay is dangerous to the health of babies especially for low income and medically fragile communities.And the President is taking action too. Working together to end this crisis! 
RepNikema,There is no time to lose getting baby formula back to families. I am proud to have voted to pass legislation tonight that will help our parents and families including Black and brown communities already struggling. No parent should have to worry about food for their baby.
RepNikema,ALSO TODAY I will vote for legislation that will give low-income families more access to infant formula. Families who depend on the Women Infants and Children (WIC) nutrition program need access to safe reliable infant formula and we need to make sure it's available.üßµ(3/3)
RepNikema,TODAY I will vote to pass legislation giving the FDA $28 million to address the urgent infant formula shortage. That funding will help the FDA approve more baby formula companies while stopping fraudulent products and producers from hurting parents and children. üßµ(2/3)
RepNikema,Parents and families should NEVER have to worry that they cannot feed their infants. Earlier this week I signed @RepSherrill's letter asking @POTUS to immediately take action to get infant formula into parents' hands. Today I'm glad to see the House taking action too: üßµ(1/3)
RepNikema,The @NewDemCoalition turns 25 this year!I'm proud to be a (new!) #NewDem in Congress and even prouder to work with my colleagues to bring new jobs to the #FightingFifth build Black wealth across the country and advance social justice in our economy!
RepNikema,I‚Äôm a proud union member. I've seen first-hand the difference that unions make for workers and I know that EVERY worker deserves a fair vote and a fair chance to form a union. That's why I support the #PROAct to empower workers and protect their right to organize. 
RepNikema,I'm proud to be #HBCUmade and I will never pass up the chance to shout out HBCUs and Black excellence in higher education.Thank you so much to @thepropelcenter ambassador and @SpelmanCollege student Sanaa Rowser for the wonderful chat. 
RepNikema,Everyone in the #FightingFifth deserves high-quality job training and a high-quality job. I am so glad that the House voted tonight to pass the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funding important workforce development systems that will train a MILLION workers a year.
