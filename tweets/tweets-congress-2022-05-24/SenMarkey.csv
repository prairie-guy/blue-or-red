SenMarkey,Abolish the filibuster and pass gun safety legislation now.
SenMarkey,I am horrified by news of another mass shooting and my heart breaks for the families of the young children and teacher killed in Uvalde. Congress has a moral responsibility to end gun violence now. To those who refuse to act there are no excuses. Only complicity and shame.
SenMarkey,The stakes for our planet have never been higher. We must break the cycle of nuclear escalation and secure a future where the fate of millions no longer hangs on the whims and judgment of fallible leaders or the military-industrial complex. 
SenMarkey,Republicans are trying to save a nuclear bomb that is 100 times more powerful than the one used on Hiroshima. That’s homicidal. Luckily @POTUS reportedly plans to retire it. No matter what we must do more to move the Doomsday Clock back from midnight. 
SenMarkey,Alzheimer’s is a devastating disease that deprives millions of Americans of their quality of life and well-being. I am proud to help introduce legislation that builds on progress spurred by the National Alzheimer’s Project Act which I co-authored in 2010. 
SenMarkey,Putin just banned me from Russia. The only thing this does is confirm what we’ve known all along—Putin and his Big Oil cronies are lashing out because they can no longer prey on U.S. consumers to fund their fossil fueled conflict.
SenMarkey,Today Republicans blocked the Small Business COVID Relief Act and turned their back on small businesses who have shouldered the burden of this pandemic. Congress must provide relief so these businesses can get the resources they need to keep our local economies thriving.
SenMarkey,
SenMarkey,Trump made firearm manufacturers exempt from pandemic restrictions. Now gun sales and shipments are skyrocketing creating a rich target for theft. I’m asking shipping companies for more information to prevent guns from being stolen during transit. 
SenMarkey,As the privacy and wellbeing of kids and teens online reaches a crisis point this statement by the FTC is an important step. But it can't replace legislative action. Congress must pass my bipartisan bill to protect kids and teens online.  
SenMarkey,Participating in my school's science fair planted the seeds for my career-long opposition to the nuclear arms race. I know how important these projects are and am proud of these future scientists from @LexingtonHSMa as they advance to the National Science Bowl's National Finals. 
SenMarkey,President Biden is right to invoke the Defense Production Act and fly in supplies from abroad to make sure that parents and caregivers across the country have the baby formula they desperately need. We must not let corporate greed stand in the way of feeding our children. 
SenMarkey,Congress needs to pass bold and ambitious climate legislation that addresses the full scale of the climate crisis and delivers clean energy jobs and justice. But the Biden Administration can also take important action right now to make progress on our clean power goals. 
SenMarkey,Today Haitians face significant challenges—including political instability and a lack of essential services and security. I support the Haitian community at home and abroad in their ongoing work to restore democracy and security to the people of Haiti.
SenMarkey,On this Haitian Flag Day we recognize the important contributions of people of Haitian descent to Massachusetts and the United States. Haiti was the first free Black republic in the Western Hemisphere and its flag serves as an inspiring symbol of freedom from colonization.
SenMarkey,Gun manufacturers are marketing AR-15-style assault rifles to children too young to use the stove much less a firearm. These are weapons of war that have no place in the hands of kids. I'm calling on the @FTC to investigate.
