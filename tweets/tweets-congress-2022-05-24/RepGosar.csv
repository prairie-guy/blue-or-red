RepGosar,We've proven time and time again that the 2020 election was stolen from President Trump. It's long past time for state officials to DO something about it.
RepGosar,@FoppoliForSC07 Absolutely right Alex. Fentanyl is driving the national overdose epidemic - it must end ASAP and it starts with closing our borders.
RepGosar,An 'incredible transition' to a lower standard of living maybe. Remember when a gallon of gas was $2 or less? You know back when we had a President who wasn't actively trying to harm the country? 
RepGosar,America First doesn't mean 'globalism second'. It means the interests and goals of the global elites aren't even on our list.
RepGosar,The Democratic party is the party of hatred. They hate America they hate people who love America and they hate the religion and the descendants of the people who built America.
RepGosar,Before we restore our country we must restore the hearts souls dreams &amp; ambitions of the forgotten Americans between the coasts. The backbone &amp; foundation of America has been stepped on &amp; spit on for far too long by elites who hate us.Let's put Americans first again.
RepGosar,
RepGosar,Severe economic distress may be on the horizon due to the Biden Regime's gross incompetence. Plus millions of illegals are pouring across the border causing irreversible economic and social harm.But hey! At least we sent $62 billion to Ukraine! ðŸ™„
RepGosar,"Record crime record immigration record costs record inflation... Russia didn't do this to us. Leftists did this to us and this is their idea of ""progress""."
RepGosar,120000 followers on Gab since November means more and more people get their news from the Gosar Minute and reject CNN.Follow me over on Gab. #UltraMAGA 
RepGosar,With millions of illegals flooding into our country bringing record amounts of fentanyl crime and trafficking every state is now effectively a 'border state'. We need to stop this. A finished border wall and a total immigration moratorium is the bare minimum.
RepGosar,ðŸš¨ GOSAR MINUTE ðŸš¨ I recently introduced important legislation to impose economic sanctions on Mexico for their failure to stop deadly drugs like fentanyl from entering our country. WATCH: 
RepGosar,@elonmusk @Jim_Jordan Their whole narrative is fake. All lies from the Democrats.As usual.
RepGosar,It's not a 'conspiracy theory' and it isn't 'disinformation'. They're open about their plans for America's future now. 
RepGosar,Fentanyl poisoning remains a leading cause of death. It comes from China and Mexico through our open borders. 105000 Americans killed last year. Watch this discussion with @KariLake @sherifflamb1 to learn more. 
RepGosar,We must stop the WHO 'pandemic treaty' and reject the false song of globalism.Let's put America our sovereignty and our interest first instead of a cabal trying to take everything away from us.
RepGosar,@elonmusk Funny how the knives come out the day after you say you're voting Republican. Is anyone surprised?
RepGosar,Under the Biden regime our military has been steadily declining. The reports of horrific and substandard living conditions in the Navy has led to record problems and low morale. I recently wrote to @SECNAV to look into this. 
RepGosar,The Ministry of Truth is dead. Next up: Roe v. Wade.
RepGosar,@elonmusk Welcome Elon. Glad to have you. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
RepGosar,Did anyone else notice how quickly they dropped the 'build back better' nonsense once they made everything objectively worse?
