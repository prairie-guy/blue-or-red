RepMarkGreen,Enjoyed being in Dover for its annual Eagle Fest celebration. Eagle Fest is the perfect salute to freedom our service members and an amazing reflection of the patriotism of the people of Dover. 
RepMarkGreen,.@101stAASLTDIV doing what it does best. Proud of their dedication to excellence.
RepMarkGreen,✍️I'm demanding President Biden reject any commitment to the #WHO that does not adhere to the requirements of the Constitution’s Treaty Clause or any commitments that would infringe on the powers reserved to the states. 
RepMarkGreen,It's the height of foolishness that the Biden Administration would even consider any further commitments to the #WHO an institution that worked in concert with the Chinese Communist Party to deflect the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. /1
RepMarkGreen,President Biden is hellbent on making sure every state becomes a border state.
RepMarkGreen,Xi Jinping doesn’t take President Biden seriously.
RepMarkGreen,🚨👉 @SpeakerPelosi refuses to bring my bill to immediately ease the formula crisis up for a vote. Parents shouldn’t have to wait on Speaker Pelosi’s political games to see formula on shelves. 
RepMarkGreen,When will President Biden understand that energy independence = national security!? Tapping into yet another reserve will not ease skyrocketing diesel prices but ending this war on American energy sure will.
RepMarkGreen,Enjoyed celebrating Week of the Eagles with @101stAASLTDIV @FortCampbell. The Rendezvous BBQ was a great event honoring “80 years of getting it done with the 101!” 🦅🇺🇸 
RepMarkGreen,President Biden slow-stepped his response to the formula crisis.➡️My bill takes immediate action to course correct the shortage by lifting tariffs and regulations. 
RepMarkGreen,Every day that passes with an out-of-control crisis at the border = another day that @CBP and state national guardsmen are put at risk.
RepMarkGreen,The truth always comes out→ The Biden Admin. colluded with members of the #NSBA to target peaceful parents w/ investigations for speaking out against their child’s curriculum. Better yet Democrat leadership struck down my amendment preventing this again.
RepMarkGreen,To the men and women of every branch who choose to selflessly defend our great nation—you are the very best among us. Today and every day we honor your bravery commitment and service. #ArmedForcesDay
RepMarkGreen,Good news. ⤵️You can’t count on the Biden Administration to make the right decision. President Biden knows ending #Title42 = catastrophic impact. He just doesn’t care. 
RepMarkGreen,President Biden’s checklist to destroy America: ✔️Do nothing about record-high gas prices. ✔️Don’t secure the border. ✔️Ignore inflation.
RepMarkGreen,Tennessee farmers and small businesses can’t afford one-party Democrat rule in Washington.
RepMarkGreen,#ICYMI → My Baby Formula Emergency Act lifts the bureaucratic red tape in order to get parents baby formula NOW. More on my bill: 
RepMarkGreen,Happy Week of the Eagles @101stAASLTDIV @FortCampbell! Celebrating 80 years of your continued excellence and unmatched capabilities. We are a grateful nation for your service! 🦅🇺🇸
RepMarkGreen,An unborn baby is a life worth protecting. An unborn baby is a life—period.
RepMarkGreen,Saying I’m a terrorist after going to combat to save our country from real terrorists just goes to show you how lost the woke left really is.
RepMarkGreen,This devastating crisis deserves President Biden’s immediate and full attention. When will he fix it? 
RepMarkGreen,As opportunities ⬆️ in Latin America the nearshoring of manufacturing will ⬇️ migration to the U.S. southern border. My Western Hemisphere Nearshoring Act is a no-brainer.
RepMarkGreen,Parents across the country are grappling with the heartbreaking reality of bare shelves and rationed baby formula—a critical crisis that has highlighted just how brittle and prone to supply shocks the baby formula supply chain is. My new bill addresses this crisis: 
RepMarkGreen,When will @HouseDemocrats condemn this across the board? Violence of any kind is wrong and will not be tolerated. 
RepMarkGreen,5 days until President Biden lifts #Title42. 5 days until our border becomes even more disastrous than it already is. ⤵️President Biden wants every state to become a border state.
RepMarkGreen,My Baby Formula Emergency Act in the short-term will help solve the crisis immediately by allowing for an influx of baby formula by suspending burdensome tariffs and restrictions: 
RepMarkGreen,President Biden is breaking all the wrong records:👉Skyrocketing inflation. 👉Nearly 3 million illegal border encounters. 👉Gas surging to record-highs. 👉Fentanyl from the border killing young Americans.
RepMarkGreen,April was the worst month on record with 234088 encounters at the southern border. And in 6 days President Biden will lift #Title42 and border patrol will be even worse off than they already are.
RepMarkGreen,Two different DNAs. Two different blood supplies. Two people. I’m for life. 
RepMarkGreen,The dystopian “Disinformation” Governance Board had no place being created in the first place. This “pause” should be forever.
RepMarkGreen,Why won’t Democrat leadership let my amendment preventing federal investigations into peaceful parents for speaking out against school curriculum come up for a vote? 
RepMarkGreen,I will always #BackTheBlue. 
RepMarkGreen,No one believes the Biden Administration will enforce any law at the border. Resign. 
RepMarkGreen,My amendment would have protected parents’ ability to speak up and question harmful curriculum like Critical Race Theory and obscene reading materials in their child’s school while ensuring parents don’t become the federal government’s next target—again.
RepMarkGreen,It’s truly unbelievable that Democrat leadership couldn’t bring themselves to protect parents from senseless investigations into their First Amendment activities. @BreitbartNews breaks down the rejection of my amendment.
