RepDavidKustoff,Roberta and I are heartbroken to learn of the shooting at the elementary school in Uvalde Texas. We are praying for the victims their families and the community. Thank you to all first responders and law enforcement on the scene.
RepDavidKustoff,.@HUDgov's CDBG program isn't working. Many W TN communities have missed out on funding due to the program’s outdated formula. This bill the CDBG Modernization Act will establish an updated formula that better targets funds. Thanks @RepFrenchHill for introducing this bill w/me. 
RepDavidKustoff,Police officers need the proper protections to do their jobs &amp; safeguard our communities. That is why I cosponsored the Qualified Immunity Act introduced by @RepJimBanks. This bill protects our brave law enforcement officers from frivolous lawsuits meant to disrupt their duties.
RepDavidKustoff,Economists predict that by August gas prices will surpass $6/gallon. This is not sustainable. Americans are suffering due to @JoeBiden's economic policies.
RepDavidKustoff,I was in Tipton County this morning to celebrate Armed Forces Day Memorial Day and to honor the Whitley Family’s legacy of service during WWII. America is the greatest country in the world because of our servicemen and women our veterans and families like the Whitleys. 
RepDavidKustoff,It was great to visit with Ben Sanders from @FBITN this week! Tennessee is lucky to have the largest Farm Bureau in the country. Thank you for being a great resource for our West Tennessee agriculture community! 
RepDavidKustoff,The Dow has posted its eighth straight weekly loss its worst streak since 1932. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have their longest losing streak since 2001. Inflation is at a 40-year high. Under @JoeBiden the American people and the economy are struggling.
RepDavidKustoff,Our country is stronger and safer because of our men and women in America’s Armed Forces. Thank you to all those currently serving for your bravery and dedication to our nation. #ArmedForcesDay 
RepDavidKustoff,I joined @VernBuchanan in urging @SpeakerPelosi to bring the Thin Blue Line Act up for a vote. This bill ensures criminals face the strongest punishment for the murder or attempted murder of first responders. I will always support &amp; defend our brave law enforcement. #BackTheBlue
