RepBost,With over 2 million border apprehensions since Biden took office ending Title 42 will only make a bad situation worse. 
RepBost,On Friday a federal court blocked the Biden Administration from lifting Title 42 today. While this is good news the Biden Administration has appealed the ruling and continues to work toward ending this critical policy in the future.
RepBost,Thank you to the generations of Americans who have served and who continue to serve in our Armed Forces. #ArmedForcesDay 
RepBost,Pleased to report that the House passed 19 bills to help our nation’s veterans this week including my bill the VA Principles of Benefits Automation Act which will help veterans get their benefits faster. More info ↓ 
RepBost,Yesterday @RodneyDavis &amp; I succeeded in stripping this provision from the bill during our T&amp;I Committee markup. It’s maddening that Governor Pritzker was willing to increase costs for our people at a time when they're already struggling to make ends meet.
RepBost,Governor Pritzker and liberal Democrats in Chicago and Springfield tried to sneak a provision into the House Water Resources and Development Act that would have forced communities near Rend Lake to pay more for water usage.
RepBost,Last night my House colleagues and I stepped up and passed the Access to Baby Formula Act which will help vulnerable families purchase safe formula using their WIC benefits during this emergency.
RepBost,Yesterday Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to increase manufacturing of baby formula. It never should've come to this. The FDA has known about baby formula problems for months – yet he waited until shelves were bare to realize we needed to fix it.
RepBost,Big win for free speech – Biden’s Disinformation Governance Board was sidelined &amp; its executive director has resigned. This board has been a First Amendment nightmare from the start which is why my Republican colleagues &amp; I were fighting to shut it down.
RepBost,I cosponsored the Thin Blue Line Act which would make the murder or attempted murder of police &amp; first responders an aggravating factor in federal death penalty determinations. I also joined over 50 of my colleagues in urging Speaker Pelosi to bring this bill up for a vote ASAP. 
RepBost,In 2021 73 police officers were killed in the line of duty. There must be serious consequences for those who target our police and first responders.
