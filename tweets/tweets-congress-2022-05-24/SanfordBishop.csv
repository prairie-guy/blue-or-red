SanfordBishop,I was devastated to learn about today’s school shooting in Uvalde Texas. My heartfelt condolences go out to the families students faculty and community impacted by this senseless and heinous violence that has claimed innocent lives.
SanfordBishop,This Armed Forces Day we recognize those who serve our country in uniform.Words are not enough to express our country's gratitude to service members and their families. 
SanfordBishop,The @US_FDA is tasked with protecting our food supply and keeping Americans healthy. Watch at 10 AM as I lead the @AppropsDems hearing to discuss what FDA can do to ensure  infant formula is safe and back on shelves across our country. ➡ 
SanfordBishop,With H.R. 7790 Congress is acting quickly to ensure that families have access to safe &amp; affordable nutrition for their babies. It also helps prevent the sale of fake formula &amp; provides Congress w/ data to address issues in the infant formula market. 
SanfordBishop,I look forward to supporting this bill which ensures that the existing baby formula supply is safe &amp; back on shelves. I’m also eager to lead this week’s @AppropsDems hearing on identifying how this food safety failure occurred &amp; finding ways to prevent it from happening again. 
SanfordBishop,Watch the @AppropsDems hearing with @USNavy and @USMC now as we discuss the projects and funding needed to provide our sailors marines and their families the quality of life they deserve: 
SanfordBishop,Congress must work closely with @FTC &amp; @SECGov as they ensure markets are competitive &amp; fair for all Americans. Join me &amp; @AppropsDems @ 10 AM as we meet w/ administration officials to ensure they are doing just that: 
SanfordBishop,The Workforce Innovation &amp; Opp. Act reauthorizes programs like Job Corps (JC) which supports the Turner JC Center in Albany GA. This is an example of how this bill strengthens connections b/t employers schools &amp; job training to help economies flourish.
