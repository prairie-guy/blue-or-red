RepJuliaLetlow,I am heartbroken for those who lost their lives today at Robb Elementary School. Our prayers go out to the families loved ones and first responders in Uvalde.
RepJuliaLetlow,The majority’s answer to the formula crisis is writing a massive check to the very agency that ignored every warning sign. @HouseGOP members are introducing bills that will actually put formula back on shelves instead of just giving a pay raise to government bureaucrats. 
RepJuliaLetlow,"""The little boy from Ferriday Louisiana listening to Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams never thought he’d be in a Hall amongst them."" Congratulations to Jerry Lee Lewis a true #LA05 legend on his induction to the @countrymusichof! "
RepJuliaLetlow,It's always great to be back in Central Louisiana! Thanks to the @CenlaChamber for hosting me today to provide an update on the critical work we have underway in #LA05 and Washington. 
RepJuliaLetlow,Louisiana has both the natural resources and the skilled workforce that can make America energy independent again. It’s infuriating that our people are now paying record high gas prices because of this Administration's war on domestic production.
RepJuliaLetlow,"Parents across the country are having to admit their children to the hospital because they can't find the basic life-sustaining formula their baby needs. They can't wait for it to ""gradually get better."" "
RepJuliaLetlow,America's farmers have been forced to cope with rapidly rising costs of fertilizer and are now feeling the crunch of this fuel crisis. Until Congress is serious about real relief for our farmers Americans will be paying the price at the grocery store. 
RepJuliaLetlow,Today I questioned @DrCaliff_FDA on when exactly we can expect formula back on the shelves.His answer: “It will gradually get better.” 
RepJuliaLetlow,Congratulations to Choudrant High School on winning the @LHSAA’s Class B State Championship in baseball! Back-to-back titles for the Aggies! 
RepJuliaLetlow,The @US_FDA knew that this formula crisis was coming. Why did they not plan accordingly? 
RepJuliaLetlow,Rodney Morine an independent trucker from #LA05’s Opelousas in the @WSJ: “His fuel costs have gone up ‘easily 25% or 30%’ adding about $150 to the cost of a trip from Louisiana to Georgia.”The high price of diesel is hurting our small businesses.
