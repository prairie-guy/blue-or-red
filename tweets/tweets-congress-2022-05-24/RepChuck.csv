RepChuck,Brenda and I are saddened and horrified by the news out of Uvalde Texas. We are praying for the victims and their families and ask you to join us.
RepChuck,Good news for America and border security! Title 42 must remain in place. 
RepChuck,A pleasure to join @newsmax today! We discussed many of the issues important to the American people like gas prices inflation and border security.You can watch my interview below! 👇 
RepChuck,I've pressed my Democrat colleagues repeatedly to give Border Patrol and ICE the resources needed to secure the border.There's no reason not to fund border security fully. Once Title 42 ends the border crisis will only worsen if we can't provide funds to secure our border. 
RepChuck,Families are spending $𝟓𝟎𝟎𝟎 𝐚 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫 on gas - up from $2800 a year ago and $3800 in March.High gas prices hurt every American &amp; are a policy choice of this Administration.Remove regulations drill more and prices will fall. 
RepChuck,TN avg. gas prices 1yr ago➡️$2.89TN avg. gas prices currently➡️$4.29Price controls and the GND aren't the answer for Americans' pain at the pump.We must end crippling regulations expedite pipeline approvals and unleash energy production. 
RepChuck,A real pleasure to meet with the TN chapter of the American College of Physicians. We discussed lowering drug prices improving telehealth services addressing physician shortages and more.I appreciate their time and for stopping by. It was great to meet with them! 
RepChuck,Phil Smartt was a giant in our Chattanooga community and devoted his life to serving others. He selflessly gave of himself to others in various civic roles and most importantly was dedicated to sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ.We have lost a great man and I will miss him. 
RepChuck,The FDA needs to create and implement a plan to get American-made formula back on store shelves. It does not need millions more in unnecessary spending.
RepChuck,the issues that caused the crisis in the first place. Since February Biden’s FDA has known of the baby formula crisis and has refused to resolve the regulatory and bureaucratic causes of this crisis.
RepChuck,Just two months ago the FDA received a $102 million increase in its budget including $11 million specifically for maternal and infant health and nutrition.Democrats’ show-vote last night is the worst of DC where Congress throws money at a problem instead of resolving...
RepChuck,Great to meet with Dr. Zacharia from @ORNL today! The Oak Ridge National Laboratory supports countless jobs in Oak Ridge and is critical to meeting our nation's technology energy health and security needs.Always great to see him and his team! 
RepChuck,Great to meet with fellow Tennesseans here in DC advocating for resources to end Alzheimer's.It's crucial to invest in research and development for therapeutics and expanded clinical trials in the hope of one day finding a cure. #EndAlz 
RepChuck,Our right to freedom of speech is inalienable. No government agency or bureaucrat can ever police the speech of any American.We must remain vigilant and ensure Biden's Administration doesn't attempt to try and censor peoples' speech again.
