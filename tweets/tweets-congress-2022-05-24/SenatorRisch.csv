SenatorRisch,I've long pushed for reform at the WHO – and still have serious concerns over its mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Chinese Communist Party’s malign influence over the WHO must end. Full stop.The @WHO should look inward before placing mandates on countries like the US. 
SenatorRisch,March saw the most illegal immigrants at the southern border in 22 years. April just broke that record.The administration must fulfill its responsibility to the American people &amp; secure the U.S.-Mexico border.
SenatorRisch,The administration claims the border is closed. But last month 234088 illegal immigrants were encountered at our southern border &amp; most were entered into the U.S. immigration system. 
SenatorRisch,Americans continue to see record gas prices.  The solution? American-made energy. 
SenatorRisch,This poll from @CBSNews is telling of the sentiment across the country. Americans are genuinely frustrated &amp; feel the President is not working for them.  
SenatorRisch,
SenatorRisch,Since day one President Biden has failed to take full advantage of America’s abundant energy supply. This inaction has resulted in record prices at the pump.The Lease Now &amp; ONSHORE Acts unleash our nation’s greatest assets &amp; will help America become energy independent. 
SenatorRisch,Without #Title42 the National Border Patrol Council predicts over 200000 migrants will be released into the United States next month – a surge unlike any we’ve seen. The administration cannot in good conscience allow Title 42 to end.
SenatorRisch,Ten straight days of record prices at the pump. Ten straight days of the Biden administration doing little to help Americans. Livelihoods are at stake. Mr. President increase lease sales roll back regulations &amp; unleash the potential of American energy.
SenatorRisch,Over 70 years ago Army Private First Class Kenneth L. Bridger was declared MIA. Last night he was finally reunited with his family in Twin Falls. 
SenatorRisch,The numbers speak for themselves. Title 42 must remain in place. 
SenatorRisch,Unelected bureaucrats should not serve as the arbiters of truth. This is a major victory for free speech. 
SenatorRisch,Instead of increasing energy production here at home our President is turning to #Venezuela – an authoritarian regime with a history of egregious human rights violations. We should be producing oil here at home not begging autocracies for bailouts.
