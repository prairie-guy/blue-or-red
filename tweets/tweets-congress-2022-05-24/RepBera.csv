RepBera,Great to speak today with members of the Carmichael Chamber of Commerce.We discussed efforts to fight inflation and bring down costs for #CA07 families and small businesses as well as the need to pass the COMPETES Act to spur U.S. manufacturing and innovation. 
RepBera,Decades of neglect and underinvestment in our infrastructure have contributed to supply chain backups.That’s why I voted for the #BipartisanInfrastructureLaw which makes overdue investments in our ports and airports helping goods get to the market faster and at lower costs.
RepBera,Great to meet with my fellow doctors at @ACPinternists to discuss ways to both expand access to health coverage and make it more affordable for American families. 
RepBera,For a quarter-century the @NewDemCoalition has broken through partisan gridlock to deliver solutions to grow our economy spur innovation and strengthen the middle class.Proud to join my colleagues to celebrate our accomplishments &amp; discuss our work ahead.#25YearsofNewDems 
RepBera,The steps taken by the House of Representatives will provide the FDA with the resources it needs to address this shortage while helping prevent a crisis like this from ever occurring again.For our nation's families the Senate must immediately pass these bills without delay.
RepBera,As a doctor I understand the health impact that the formula shortage is having on our nation’s babies and families which is why I whole-heartedly voted last night for legislation that will immediately address this health emergency.
RepBera,The baby formula shortage facing our country is unacceptable.No parent should EVER have to worry about finding safe food for their infants.
RepBera,We must redouble our efforts to combat discrimination and institutional hurdles that #AAPI members face in entering public service while increasing recruitment and retention.
RepBera,As we mark Asian Pacific American Heritage Month today I convened a @HouseForeign roundtable to examine the barriers that #AAPI professionals face when joining public service.
RepBera,Documented Dreamers were raised in America and know this country as their only home. Yet they risk having to self-deport by the age of 21 because of backlogs in the immigration system.Congress must pass the America’s CHILDREN Act to extend protections to these young people. 
RepBera,#Taiwan has been an historic partner on global health security helping lead the fight against AIDS tuberculosis and #COVID19.I join @SecBlinken in calling on the @WHO to invite Taiwan to participate in the World Health Assembly as an observer.It’s time to #LetTaiwanHelp.
