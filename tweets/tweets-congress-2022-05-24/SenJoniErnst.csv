SenJoniErnst,A senseless horrendous act of evil. My heart is with all those in Texas right now.
SenJoniErnst,Thanks for joining me in this commonsense effort Chuck! #BUILDITAct 
SenJoniErnst,#MakeEmSqueal #BUILDITAct 
SenJoniErnst,Not only will using our border wall materials end the Democrats’ taxpayer funded waste it will help mitigate President Biden’s out of control border crisis. #BUILDITAct 
SenJoniErnst,.@POTUS stop wasting taxpayer dollars on guarding unused border wall materials. Here’s an idea: if we’re paying for the materials let’s use them! #BUILDITAct 
SenJoniErnst,#DYK: American taxpayers are paying $3 million per day for contractors to guard unused Southern border wall materials.
SenJoniErnst,Today throughout the state members from my staff will be available in-person to help with casework matters like Medicare Social Security Passports &amp; more. See locations near you below! 
SenJoniErnst,Our border patrol agents have the difficult and dangerous job of being the first line of defense day in and day out. Thank you @CBP for your commitment and service! 🇺🇸 
SenJoniErnst,Let’s make this #MotorcycleSafetyAwarenessMonth the start of a fun and safe summer! Together we can make this the safest year ever for motorcyclists. 🏍☀️ 
SenJoniErnst,The American people have no confidence in our president’s ability to pull us out of record high inflation—and it shows. 
SenJoniErnst,Iowa biofuel could help bring the U.S. out of the energy crisis we currently find ourselves in but President Biden would rather bank on his deranged and unreliable climate policy.
SenJoniErnst,Getting sanctioned by Putin is a pretty clear sign that I’m doing something right. He can put my name at the top of his list. 
SenJoniErnst,Putin is using food as a weapon in his unjust war. American farmers are ready and willing to help fill the gap but bureaucratic requirements are preventing us from moving food aid quickly. Learn more: 
SenJoniErnst,Over $4.00 per gallon of gas nationwide is not only unacceptable it’s unaffordable. President Biden needs to change course and unleash American energy immediately. 
SenJoniErnst,Today representatives from my office will be available in Plymouth County to assist with federal casework issues or questions. Come on by! 📍⬇️ 
SenJoniErnst,Border security is national security. Our communities are being infiltrated with illegal arms and drugs because of the #BidenBorderCrisis.
SenJoniErnst,This month is #MotorcycleSafetyAwarenessMonth. Motorcycling is a great American tradition across the U.S. With warm weather just around the corner many will be pulling their bikes out for the summer season. So please look out for riders so that we can all stay safe on the road!
SenJoniErnst,Thank you to all of our brave servicemembers for their heroism and commitment to our great nation. #MilitaryAppreciationMonth 🇺🇸
SenJoniErnst,God bless our servicemembers and their families 🇺🇸 
SenJoniErnst,Under President Biden crises just keep arising. Whether it’s the Southern border American energy inflation supply chains—you name it the Biden admin does not have it handled.
SenJoniErnst,Proud to join alongside 50 of my colleagues to include Taiwan in the proposed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Our support for Taiwan and its independence must remain unwavering.🇹🇼
SenJoniErnst,As Putin’s lawless war on Ukraine threatens hunger for millions worldwide Iowa farmers are ready to step in and help. Temporarily waiving bureaucratic cargo rules will make sure they can do the job and help countless folks in need. 
SenJoniErnst,American families and farmers cannot afford to pay these record high fuel costs for months on end. President Biden is holding up American energy and resources. 
SenJoniErnst,It was great to join @FUELINGIowa @GrowthEnergy ADM and Wolf Carbon Solutions this week to discuss the role biofuel can and should play in an all-of-the-above energy economy. 
SenJoniErnst,The Biden administration killed the Keystone XL pipeline and with it hurt our energy sector &amp; thousands of American jobs. The Biden agenda is making America less energy independent and more reliant on some of the most corrupt countries in the world.
SenJoniErnst,The #BidenBorderCrisis is about to get worse. Without Title 42 we will risk thousands of illegal immigrants coming through our border every single month.
SenJoniErnst,It was a pleasure to meet with @SiouxlandChamber this week to discuss child care reduced access to housing vouchers small business issues and workforce training. I look forward to having them back in D.C. again! 
SenJoniErnst,Iowans are draining their savings to cover the costs brought on by #Bidenflation. Yet the Democrats in Washington are steadfast on jamming through their radical spending agenda as a ‘solution.’
SenJoniErnst,I teamed up with @ChrisCoons and introduced a bill to temporarily waive U.S. cargo preferences so that we can expedite food all over the world to the countries affected by Putin’s vicious attack. 
SenJoniErnst,Iowa is one of the states that has been hit hardest by the baby formula shortage—with roughly 50% of our supply unavailable. The Biden administration needs to step up and give our parents solutions that won’t keep them waiting for weeks.
SenJoniErnst,We’ve been warning the Biden admin for weeks that lifting Title 42 could unleash the floodgates at our Southern border but still they remain unwavering in their decision to lift it just days from now.
SenJoniErnst,Gas prices under President Biden have increased every day for over a week. @POTUS remove your restrictions on American energy &amp; help out families who are struggling across the entire country.
SenJoniErnst,Today members from my staff will be available in-person to assist with federal casework matters and questions. See locations below⬇️ 
SenJoniErnst,It’s a fact: life is more expensive under President Biden. #Bidenflation 
SenJoniErnst,.@SmallBizCmteGOP just passed my bipartisan VET Act to codify training for veteran-entrepreneurs as they transition to civilian life. Thanks to my fellow veteran @SenDuckworth for helping lead this important legislation. Our vets deserve bright futures! 
SenJoniErnst,The Biden administration needs to rethink their dependence on deranged climate policies. 
SenJoniErnst,Under President Biden gas prices are through the roof violent crime is everywhere and basic necessities have been backlogged for weeks at a time.
SenJoniErnst,Expediting food aid to countries effected by Russia’s war on Ukraine will feed millions of children around the world. 
SenJoniErnst,A selfless act from this Iowa mother who rose to the occasion and provided for so many others who are currently struggling to feed their babies. 👏
SenJoniErnst,Families are already up against limited groceries &amp; high prices because of supply chain shortages &amp; #Bidenflation. Now there will be even less food because our farmers need to counterbalance outrageous diesel fuel costs &amp; produce less. @POTUS release American energy at once.
SenJoniErnst,Always a pleasure to host folks visiting from Iowa here in D.C. for constituent coffee!☕️🍩 
SenJoniErnst,Today members of my staff will be popping up in 4⃣ counties to assist with federal casework matters like Medicare Social Security Passports &amp; more! 
SenJoniErnst,Iowa is one of the states that has been hit hardest by the baby formula shortage—with roughly 50% of our supply unavailable. The Biden administration needs to step up and give our parents solutions that won’t keep them waiting for weeks.
SenJoniErnst,Our American families are feeling the weight of all these Biden crises. WATCH⬇️
