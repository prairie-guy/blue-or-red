RepSylviaGarcia,.@POTUS and @HouseDemocratsâ€™ economic plan lowers everyday costs lowers the deficits and asks billionaires to pay their fair share. But the @HouseGOPâ€™s plan is to increase taxes on hardworking families and let billionaires off the hook.

RepSylviaGarcia,I always said cash is king.I'm proud today that the @FSCDems passed @RepDonaldPayne's Payment Choice Act -- which I supported and helped lead. Cash is a valid form of payment in my book! 
RepSylviaGarcia,As a Christian and Catholic I support the freedom for women to make personal decisions about their own #reproductivehealthcare. Republicans have no place in imposing themselves on a woman's right to choose. Period. #ReproductiveRights are #HumanRights. 
RepSylviaGarcia,@MollyJongFast The numbers don't lie. But Republicans will say they didn't get the memo...
RepSylviaGarcia,It's simple. Republicans are not listening to the MAJORITY of Americans who indeed believe women should have access to reproductive healthcare. They are only listening to their political base. Watch my full interview with @cspanwj:
