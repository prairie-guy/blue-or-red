RepKweisiMfume,It is long past time to speak out against the separatist theories that divide our nation and to keep guns away from deranged people. #StopTheKilling #BuffaloStrong @MomsDemand
RepKweisiMfume,The U.S. House sent the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act to the U.S. Senate last night focusing law enforcement resources on race- and hate-based crimes in America.
RepKweisiMfume,Too many guns are killing too many people in this country with racial hate too often being the root cause of the killings. 
RepKweisiMfume,The House has taken action through this bill to ensure Big Oil stops #RippingOffAmericans and lower prices at the pump across the country.
RepKweisiMfume,Today I voted in favor of the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act which passed the U.S. House of Representatives. This bill would work to fight price gouging by Big Oil and Gas companies and protect local gas stations during times of supply chain issues and high prices. 
RepKweisiMfume,This bill supports federal law enforcement and investigative agencies in a combined effort to combat domestic terrorism and other domestic threats in our country including threats stemming from white supremacist and neo-Nazi beliefs.
RepKweisiMfume,My prayers go out to all who were affected by the horrific shootings that occurred this past weekend across the country. This evening I will vote in favor of the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act in the U.S. House of Representatives.
RepKweisiMfume,These are critical bills to combat this consequential shortage and protect American families. #FeedOurInfants now! 
RepKweisiMfume,And the Access to Baby Formula Act which allows lower-income families to utilize their WIC benefits to buy safe formula as we battle this crisis.
RepKweisiMfume,The Infant Formula Supplemental Appropriations Act 2022 which will fund the FDA with $28 million to address the shortage and safely re-establish supply.
RepKweisiMfume,To the mothers and families directly impacted by the baby formula shortage I hear your understandable pleas and stresses during this crisis. Today I will be voting in favor of two bills to address this emergency. They are:
RepKweisiMfume,To do so it is essential Congress stay committed to #InvestingInWorkers and this bill triumphantly falls in line with this objective.
RepKweisiMfume,In a recovering economy with businesses searching for employees this bill funds workforce development programs that can be a link between developing our workforce to meet today’s demands and create an America where all who want to work can work. 
RepKweisiMfume,H.R. 7309 the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) of 2022 passed in the U.S. House of Representatives this evening.
