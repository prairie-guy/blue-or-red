RepPfluger,As we learn more details of the heartbreaking tragedy in Uvalde Camille and I are praying for the loved ones of the victims and for healing for the entire South Texas community.
RepPfluger,In the same week we learn: DHS released a suspected terrorist into the U.S. &amp; ISIS operatives planned to assassinate President Bush after illegally crossing the southern border.  The threat of a deadly attack on U.S. soil is grave. We MUST secure our border.
RepPfluger,Forbes is reporting an ISIS plotter planned to assassinate George W. Bush with four Iraqi compatriots smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border.The threat of terrorism due to our porous southern border grows every day. We must secure our border. 
RepPfluger,The Biden Admin’s Department of Homeland Security released a suspected terrorist into the U.S. for nearly three weeks. This is unacceptable and a huge threat to Americans.Border security is national security! 
RepPfluger,American taxpayer dollars should never be used to enrich the #CCP. My bill to prevent DHS grants from going to universities that host Confucius Institutes is a critical step in confronting China's threats to our national security.Read more:
RepPfluger,@CiaranCuffe Great visiting with you!
RepPfluger,I’m glad the court recognizes the harm that would be inflicted on Texas and other states if Title 42 was lifted in spite of Biden’s best efforts to further his open border policies.
RepPfluger,"The Democrats' latest attempt to smear oil &amp; gas workers and businesses with outcry over made-up claims of ""price gouging"" will do nothing to bring down prices.The price gouging claim is a farce.The solution to the high prices at the pump is MORE American energy production. "
RepPfluger,Midland Over Moscow! 
RepPfluger,.@WaPo is reporting that the Disinformation Governance Board is being shut down. Our @HouseGOP bill to defund the board + rightful outrage from Republicans has succeeded.@RepBoebert @RepFranklin @GOPLeader @RepMikeJohnson @SteveScalise @RepScottPerry    
RepPfluger,"Last week Madelon Clark completed her spring internship in my DC office! Madelon is from Menard Texas and is studying Ag Comms at Texas Tech. Please join me in saying ""thank you"" for Madelon’s hard work on behalf of our district. #TX11 is a better place because of you! "
