SenatorWarnock,As a father of two young children this tragedy is horrific and numbing.I'm praying that God surrounds the victims their families and community with abundant love and healing. 
SenatorWarnock,Savannah CRTC is a critical combat readiness training center for the nation. The center provides cost-effective high-quality national security training for Airmen &amp; is a critical part of coastal GA's ecosystem.  Closing the center would be a mistake. 
SenatorWarnock,I am working to ensure the competition bill uplifts all Georgians from researchers at schools like @savannahstate to start-up founders around the state to students in our rural communities who will innovate &amp; fill jobs we cannot yet imagine. Let's get to work.
SenatorWarnock,Gas prices are hurting Georgians’ wallets.  That's why I'm focused on holding wealthy corporations accountable and urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass my Gas Prices Relief Act *now* to lower costs at the pump for Georgians.
SenatorWarnock,Won’t stop pushing until we get the bipartisan competition bill across the finish line. 
SenatorWarnock,It’s simple: when it comes to serving our veterans who sacrificed to defend our freedoms we’ve got to have their backs.Rest assured Georgia I’m keeping close tabs to make sure VA is doing right by our veterans.

SenatorWarnock,As the proud son of a World War II veteran our servicemembers military families &amp; veterans have a special place in my heart.  On this Armed Forces Day we celebrate the men and women who protect our country defend our freedoms and restrain evil in the world.
SenatorWarnock,I’m going to keep saying it: If you need insulin you need insulin. It’s not optional.Insulin users in Georgia deserve to be healthy and happy. My Affordable Insulin Now Act will help them do that by capping costs for their life-saving medication.
SenatorWarnock,I’m going to keep pushing President Biden for *strong* debt relief that actually helps Georgians and Americans—and I’ll keep doing so until I see real action.
SenatorWarnock,As a native Savannahian I’m thrilled @Hyundai is opening its 1st full electric vehicle &amp; battery facility in the U.S. in coastal GA! Very proud to support federal investments that helped pave the way for these 8100+ jobs &amp; will help bring more clean jobs to our state. 
SenatorWarnock,There is a serious mental health crisis impacting Georgia and our nation. I’m determined to get something done which is why I introduced a package of mental health legislation to help expand access to mental health care for all Georgians. #MentalHealthMatters
SenatorWarnock,Housing is dignity. It is the foundation that helps people support their families and contribute to their community.I'm so glad we were able to secure over $170 million to make it easier for Georgians to find affordable cost-effective housing. 
SenatorWarnock,Canceling student loan debt would lower the load for hardworking Georgians and spur entrepreneurship. We have to get it done and I’m going to keep pushing the President to make it happen.
SenatorWarnock,When we make strong investments in research development &amp; innovation we unleash the potential for new economic opportunities in every corner of GA. I'm focused on passing the competition bill to help create jobs and keep Georgia’s economy moving into the future.
SenatorWarnock,Georgia's small businesses have been resilient while navigating our changing economy but owners tell me that they still need help.While I’m disappointed the Small Business COVID Relief Act didn't pass today I'm going to keep fighting to move this bill forward.
SenatorWarnock,That’s right @RepBuddyCarter – for GA and our nation’s security the Savannah CRTC must remain open. It provides high-quality training for Airmen and is a critical part of the military ecosystem in coastal GA. 
SenatorWarnock,The baby formula shortage is putting a substantial burden on parents &amp; caregivers and has put the health of babies &amp; infants across GA at risk.   I’m pushing the federal government to do more to boost infant formula production &amp; prevent future supply chain issues.
SenatorWarnock,I always enjoy meeting with my friends from @GeorgiaIPL to discuss how we can keep working together to boost conservation and support healthy communities across GA. I’m proud of my work in the Senate to grow sustainable jobs and help prepare our state for a greener future. 
SenatorWarnock,Significantly canceling student debt will provide long-term benefits to individuals &amp; the economy—helping Georgians buy their first homes open a small business or invest in their retirement.  I made clear to the President that Georgians need strong student debt relief.
SenatorWarnock,Since I graduated from @Morehouse the world has changed &amp; now student debt is larger than credit card debt in America. Relieving some student debt would do a lot to help Georgians navigate our changing economy. We’re in this fight together.
SenatorWarnock,We must pass a serious bipartisan competition bill to boost American manufacturing and unlock technological &amp; scientific discoveries that we cannot yet imagine. I’m working hard to get this done for Georgia.
