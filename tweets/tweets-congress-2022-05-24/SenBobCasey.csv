SenBobCasey,We cannot continue to stand by as more of our children are killed in mass shootings. The United States is the only country on the planet where this happens regularly.These victims need more than thoughts and prayers. They need action. We need commonsense gun legislation. Now. 
SenBobCasey,No parent should ever have to worry about whether or not they’ll be able to feed their babies or what they’re feeding them is safe.We need my Protect Infants from Formula Shortages Act to make sure this never happens again.  
SenBobCasey,The Schuylkill was last dredged in 1999 and is long-overdue for another. That's finally happening thanks to @POTUS's infrastructure law. It's an investment in the City of Philadelphia its people and our world-class rowing community.

SenBobCasey,My Five Freedoms for America's Children is centered on the conviction that every child in America should have the freedom to reach their full potential:  
SenBobCasey,I had the chance to tour @C2CPhiladelphia's facility to see how they're meeting the needs of families in Philadelphia. While so many parents are struggling to feed their children C2C is helping to ease that burden by providing them with essentials like diapers backpacks &amp; more. 
SenBobCasey,Just heard I was banned from Russia... Was it something I said? 
SenBobCasey,Supporting our water infrastructure is as important as ever a lesson we learned all too well during Hurricane Ida when the Schuylkill flooded. This funding will support the health of the river and preserve a historic landmark.

SenBobCasey,Thank you @POTUS. This is a critical step in getting formula back on store shelves and into the homes of families across Pennsylvania and the Nation. 
SenBobCasey,I applaud the @WhiteHouse for reviving the Conference on Hunger Nutrition and Health for the first time in more than half a century. It is unacceptable that millions of Americans struggle with hunger. 
SenBobCasey,The $500000 in community project funding coming to the Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area in Homestead will be used to restore the Carrie Furnaces. What was once a long-abandoned steel mill is quickly becoming a community center for historic preservation art and education. 
SenBobCasey,Expanding access to home and community-based services would connect thousands more Pennsylvania seniors and people with disabilities with high-quality home-based care.It’s time to act for the millions of Americans reliant on these services.
SenBobCasey,Corporations spend millions of dollars on anti-union consultants and campaigns. Thanks to a loophole they’re then able to write off those activities in their taxes. Passing my #NoTaxBreaksForUnionBusting Act would put an end to that. 
SenBobCasey,America’s servicemembers in the Army Navy Marine Corps Air Force Coast Guard and Space Force put their lives on the line in service to our Nation. These men and women are heroes. Today and every day we thank them for their courage and service. #ArmedForcesDay

SenBobCasey,.@POTUS's invocation of the Defense Production Act and launch of Operation Fly Formula are critical first steps to get formula back on shelves. But we must also ensure that this kind of disaster never happens again.

SenBobCasey,.@POTUS's infrastructure law makes a historic investment in abandoned mine reclamation projects that ultimately boost local economies and make our communities safer. 
SenBobCasey,Home care is essential to millions of seniors and people with disabilities. We must make a generational investment in home care.
SenBobCasey,Hey Kyle Regina passed along your message.I agree more Dollar Dog Nights. @Phillies let's do this. 
SenBobCasey,We need to continue calling and rooting out hate wherever and whenever we see it. Far too many American lives have been lost to this senseless hate-fueled violence.We in the Senate have a moral obligation to act. It's about damn time we did.
SenBobCasey,No one legislative solution will fix this issue but we need better background checks magazine limits and extreme risk laws. We also need to pass the #DisarmHate Act my legislation to prohibit those convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes from purchasing or possessing a firearm.
SenBobCasey,It is unconscionable that we live in a Nation where an 18-year-old with a history of threatening behavior can be radicalized by racist conspiracy theories online and then walk into a store to buy assault weapons and high-capacity magazines without issue.
SenBobCasey,"From mass shooting to mass shooting and now in Buffalo we've seen a clear pattern of white supremacists taking advantage of legal loopholes and easy access to high-capacity firearms. We say ""never again"" and offer thoughts and prayers.Then we move on.This cycle has to stop."
SenBobCasey,Furniture tip-overs have claimed hundreds of lives since 2000 and caused thousands more injuries. Families deserve safety and peace of mind. We must pass the #STURDYAct.
