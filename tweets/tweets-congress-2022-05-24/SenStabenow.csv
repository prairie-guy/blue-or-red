SenStabenow,The DHS Trade and Economic Security Council Act is an important step to address critical shortages and breakdowns that will not only benefit our economy but our homeland security too. Read more here:

SenStabenow,More free COVID-19 tests are available. Visit  to order yours. 
SenStabenow,Professor Michael Barr is exactly who we need at the Federal Reserve. I can’t think of anyone who would do a better job in such a crucial role at a crucial time for families and our economy. Great to introduce him @SenateBanking with @SenGaryPeters.
