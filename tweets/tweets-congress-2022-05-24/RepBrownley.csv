RepBrownley,‚ÄúAll young people regardless of sexual orientation or identity deserve a safe and supportive environment in which to achieve their full potential.‚Äù - #HarveyMilk 
RepBrownley,Harvey Milk the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California would have turned 92 today. As a member of the @LGBTEqCaucus I am fighting every day to realize his vision of a world where LGBTQ people are truly equal. #HarveyMilkDay

RepBrownley,I would especially like to celebrate the service members and their families at Naval Base Ventura County and the Channel Islands Air National Guard Station. I join a grateful nation to thank you for your service and sacrifice. 
RepBrownley,Words are not enough to express our country's gratitude to those who have answered the call to serve ‚Äî and I will never stop fighting for them. 
RepBrownley,This Armed Forces Day we recognize the men and women who serve our country in uniform. Our service members and their families are the heart and soul of America‚Äôs defense. 
RepBrownley,While parents across the country struggle to find formula for their children 192 House Republicans voted against a bill to address the shortage. Families are demanding action not politics. The Republican response to the urgent need of families is appalling.  #FeedOurInfants
RepBrownley,Who stood with Big Oil executives and shareholders making record profits? 203 House Republicans! 
RepBrownley,Gas prices are out of control and it's time to provide consumers some relief at the pump. ‚õΩÔ∏è That's why I voted to end price gouging and penalize market manipulators while bringing transparency to this secretive market. It's time for Big Oil to stop #RippingOffAmericans.
RepBrownley,I applaud the passage of my bills and I thank my colleagues in both chambers of Congress for supporting these life-saving preventive health care measures. Given President Biden‚Äôs commitment to our nation‚Äôs veterans I expect he will quickly sign these important bills into law.
RepBrownley,Our nation‚Äôs veterans should always be provided the high-quality timely health care and services they need within the VA system. The passage of these bills gets us closer to realizing VA‚Äôs mission and upholding our promise to serve our veterans as well as they have served us.
RepBrownley,Today the House unanimously passed the MAMMO for Veterans Act and the Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas SERVICE Act two bills I authored to expand mammography and breast cancer screenings and life-saving care for veterans nationwide. 
RepBrownley,Since 1965 Head Start has provided crucial support to millions of children and families across America. Today I join in celebrating 57 years of #HeadStart giving America‚Äôs children the tools they need to succeed! #HappyBDayHeadStart 
RepBrownley,This legislation also better protects our nation‚Äôs most vulnerable families and improves access to safe formula products for the low-income families who rely on WIC benefits to feed their infants and children.
RepBrownley,That is why @HouseDemocrats are voting to help #FeedOurInfants by providing FDA the emergency funding it needs to address this shortage immediately and ensure families always have access to safe formula.
RepBrownley,Families throughout the country have felt the pain of the infant formula shortage firsthand and going to the grocery store and seeing empty shelves with no infant formula in sight is distressing for any parent.
RepBrownley,This is just another way @HouseDemocrats are strengthening our supply chain and boosting local economies.
RepBrownley,Did you know that 80% of traded goods move through U.S. ports like the @portofhueneme? That‚Äôs why @TransportDems passed the Water Resources Development Act of 2022 which invests in our ports waterways and harbors.
RepBrownley,The @NewDemCoalition turns 25 this year! I‚Äôm so proud to be a #NewDem in Congress and the work we are doing to advance effective common-sense policies that make a real difference in the lives of the American people. #MajorityMakers #25YearsofNewDems

RepBrownley,The Workforce Innovation &amp; Opportunity Act will:üë∑üèº Connect employers with skilled workersüíµ Help workers access good-paying jobs‚¨áÔ∏è Lower costs for familiesüì¶ Increase supplies@HouseDemocrats are #InvestingInWorkers!
RepBrownley,Workers need the skills and training to compete in the modern economy. That‚Äôs why I voted for legislation that will help workers gain the skills they need to access better paying jobs in high-demand occupations.
