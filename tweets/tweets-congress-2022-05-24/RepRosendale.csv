RepRosendale,Jean and I are praying for the families and victims of this horrible act.
RepRosendale,I had an enjoyable time touring Clearwater Wind Project in Eastern Montana yesterday and it was great to learn about how their services are benefiting the surrounding counties 
RepRosendale,The Biden administration should never hand over operational control of our nation's public health system to an international body.I'm proud to stand with my @freedomcaucus colleagues demanding President Biden to withdraw the United States from WHO.
RepRosendale,Had a great time at Outlaw Bar-B-Que in Forsyth this afternoon. I enjoyed talking to owner Travis Conrad and hearing about how his restaurant started. 
RepRosendale,Enjoyed meeting with Treasure County Commissioner Ruth Baue and her husband Al.Al and Ruth expressed their concerns over MT ARPA as well as agricultural and energy issues in Eastern Montana.

RepRosendale,If Members of Congress are upset because they have to vote on legislation they need to seriously reconsider why they are here. I was proud to stand on the House floor this week with my @freedomcaucus colleagues to request the “Yays” and “Nays.”
RepRosendale,I'm deeply concerned and opposed to Biden's consideration to give W.H.O operational control over our nation's public health system. The United States should not relinquish its freedoms and be beholden to foreign institutions. Questions must be answered.
RepRosendale,The draft opinion leak has fractured the trust in our nation's highest judicial bench. Undermining this sacred institution sets a dangerous precedent for future cases and it is unacceptable to pressure and intimidate certain justices to alter the outcome of a court ruling. 
RepRosendale,Enjoyed meeting with General Thompson Vice Chief of Space Operations for the U.S. Space Force. We had a great discussion about the USSF’s goals and directives as well as what they are doing to combat strategic warfare by our foreign adversaries.
