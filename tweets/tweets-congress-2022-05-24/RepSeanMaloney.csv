RepSeanMaloney,Harvey Milk was a courageous leader who dedicated his life to advancing LGBTQ rights as the first openly gay elected official in CA. I am here today because of great leaders like Harvey who chose to live authentically and with pride. #HarveyMilkDay
RepSeanMaloney,Every single day the brave men &amp; women in the military including leaders trained right here in the Hudson Valley at West Point fight to keep our nation safe and defend our freedoms.As we mark #ArmedForcesDay let us honor the bravery and sacrifice of our service members. 
RepSeanMaloney,The gas prices you see at the pump donâ€™t reflect the price of oil or even an increase caused by Putinâ€™s war â€“ theyâ€™re the result of greed by big oil companies. @HouseDemocrats are fighting back. Today we passed legislation to stop this inexcusable price gouging. 
RepSeanMaloney,We can't rely on thoughts &amp; prayers to prevent domestic terrorism. This week's shooting in Buffalo is a tragic reminder of how unwavering we must be in combating attacks led by white supremacists. I proudly voted for the #DomesticTerrorismPreventionAct to counter future threats.
RepSeanMaloney,As the proud dads of adopted kids Randy &amp; I went through our fair share of baby formula and know first-hand how vital it is for families to have access to formula. Today I was proud to vote for legislation to get safe formula to families &amp; fix this shortage. #FeedOurInfants 
RepSeanMaloney,Today we're celebrating #57YearsOfHeadStart! Head Start programs have provided kids across the country with the resources they need to thrive. Iâ€™m proud to have delivered over $10 Million to NY Head Start programs ensuring more children have the opportunity to succeed.
