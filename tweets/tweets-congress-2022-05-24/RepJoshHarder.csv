RepJoshHarder,Today would be a great day for the Senate to pass my bill making it illegal for oil CEOs to price gouge us. 
RepJoshHarder,Good now let‚Äôs get the formula on shelves. We parents need it! 
RepJoshHarder,Pam and I are currently on a waitlist for Lily‚Äôs baby formula. This shortage is real and very scary for us parents.

RepJoshHarder,RED FLAG wildfire warning in the Central Valley is still in effect today due to dry conditions and high winds. Be on the look out. 
RepJoshHarder,This is what it looks like to try and find baby formula right now. 
RepJoshHarder,The House passed our bill. Oil companies are done #RippingOffAmericans at the pump. 
RepJoshHarder,I‚Äôm about to vote on the House floor to fight back against the insane $6/ gallon we‚Äôre paying for gas. 
RepJoshHarder,Oil companies like Shell ExxonMobil and Chevron TRIPLED their revenue this year.  Meanwhile we‚Äôre paying $6 a gallon. My bill would outlaw gas price gouging.
RepJoshHarder,Great conversation with @PORACalifornia this morning talking about how we can support our law enforcement in the Valley. 
RepJoshHarder,Just in case you haven‚Äôt registered to vote and receive your mail-in ballot here‚Äôs how to do it.
RepJoshHarder,People in the Valley know too well how big an issue the air quality is. It's time we got out ahead of it. 
RepJoshHarder,Our workers shouldn‚Äôt have to drive 2 hours away to get a good paying job. We need great jobs right here in the Valley.
RepJoshHarder,Thank you to all of our Valley law enforcement officers for keeping us safe every day. #NationalPoliceWeek
