PattyMurray,I am ready to work with any one of my Senate colleagues to take immediate action to protect our kids and end the gun violence crisis in our country. 
PattyMurray,My thoughts are with the families of those lost today in Texas. No one should have to endure the pain of losing a child like this.How many more lives have to be lost before Republicans wake up to what the majority of Americans have known for years? Gun safety laws save lives.
PattyMurray,People in Washington state are feeling the sting at the gas pump and yet giant oil and gas corporations are still making record profits.We've got to hold them accountable and lower gas prices for working families.
PattyMurray,A new @FedederalReserve report highlights that the lack of quality affordable child care is one of the top things holding women back from finding a job and joining the workforce.Yet another reason to pass my child care plan: it’s good for women and our economy. 
PattyMurray,Senate Republicans’ refusal to work with Democrats to do anything to tackle the climate crisis is becoming more detrimental to future generations by the day. We can’t afford to wait any longer.
PattyMurray,Many veterans face underlying medical conditions caused by toxic exposures but have struggled to get the VA care &amp; benefits they've earned. Thanks to a bipartisan deal that's about to change—&amp; we will better meet our obligation to care for our veterans.

PattyMurray,I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: the next time any student loan borrower should have to start making payments again is at least 2023.In the meantime @POTUS should follow my plan to fix our broken student loan system.
PattyMurray,This week I met with @PortofSeattle to hear more about their goals and projects to improve @flySEA for everyone in Washington state who flies in and out of there each day.I'm committed to supporting @flySEA to make sure everyone's commutes are as quick and safe as possible. 
PattyMurray,Democrats have put forward legislation to lower everyday costs on gas child care prescription drugs housing and so much more.What do the MAGA Republicans of the Senate want to do? Raise your taxes and cut social security.

PattyMurray,We’ve got to protect the right to vote. That means giving power back to the people by passing big bold voting rights legislation. RT if you’re with me on this.
PattyMurray,I have a child care plan that would help lower costs for WA state families. But don’t just take it from me—this is something parents in our state are advocating for and I’ll keep working to deliver for them. 
PattyMurray,Within days OK will have the most extreme abortion ban in the country. It will ban abortion from the moment of fertilization—threatening IVF as well—&amp; if we don't keep fighting back with everything we got extreme Republicans will try to do this in every state in this country. 
PattyMurray,The infant formula shortage has already taken a serious toll on families—and it's been particularly hard on those with the tightest budgets. This is an all-hands-on-deck emergency and I'm glad to see the Senate take speedy action to get ALL families the support they need. 
PattyMurray,Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Today Republicans stonewalled legislation that would have gotten them the support they desperately need—but this fight isn’t over. I’ll keep exploring every possible option to get them the support they need.
PattyMurray,Glad the Senate passed legislation today to send additional resources to Ukraine. Supporting Ukraine is a national security and humanitarian priority. We’ve got to do everything we can to stop Russia’s war crimes and brutal assault on Ukraine and its democracy.
PattyMurray,I stood alongside Senate Democrats as we chart the path forward against Republicans’ extreme agenda to rewind the clock on women’s rights.This is scary and shameful stuff. We’re fighting back. 
PattyMurray,A safe affordable roof over your head is something everyone in Washington state should have.I’m fighting to secure funding for more affordable housing in our state and I'm going to keep working to make sure people can afford rent or a mortgage.
PattyMurray,Women and providers shouldn’t be punished for accessing critical health care services. Yet if Republicans got their way abortions would be banned and in some cases even criminalized.That's right—they want to punish you for getting an abortion. That’s absurd.
PattyMurray,Soon women will be forced to carry pregnancies to term when they don’t want to. That's the Republican agenda—and it’s unacceptable.  Senate Democrats are going to use every lever at our disposal to protect women’s ability to control their own bodies.

PattyMurray,"Let's be clear: the ""Great Replacement"" is a racist dangerous lie some Republicans have pushed in a calculated effort to fearmonger for votes or views.It’s shameful &amp; they’ve got to denounce it. Their continued silence on it now speaks volumes. "
PattyMurray,Republicans want to rewind the clock on your rights.Abortion. Birth Control. IVF. Plan B. You name it—Republicans want it gone.Meanwhile Senate Democrats are fighting back to protect them. Today is just the start. #RepublicansRightsRewind 
PattyMurray,We've seen anti-abortion activists use location data to target women at abortion clinics. In some cases that data has been used by prosecutors to criminally charge people.That is absolutely unacceptable. I joined @SenWarren to demand data brokers ban these practices.
