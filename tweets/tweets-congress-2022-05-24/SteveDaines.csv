SteveDaines,Just how BAD is the Biden border crisis?President Biden’s administration is already deporting 80% fewer illegal immigrants than President Obama. Now he wants to end Title 42 and give illegal immigrants a rubber stamp upon entry. Unacceptable.
SteveDaines,The early draft letter from the NSBA suggested using the military to silence parents for standing up for their children. Unbelievable. 
SteveDaines,Montanans have suffered through two straight weeks of record high gas prices.I don’t think “incredible” is the first word they’d use to describe the experience. 
SteveDaines,If there’s one thing the past few months have shown us it’s that energy security is national security. The Denbury pipeline in Baker will help support &amp; expand Made in Montana &amp; Made in America energy.We need more pipelines! 
SteveDaines,On this #ArmedForcesDay I want to thank the brave men &amp; women in uniform who selflessly serve our nation. It’s because of Montana service members that we can live in this beautiful state in our great nation peacefully.
SteveDaines,Can’t think of a better way to spend a Saturday morning than with folks in Miles City. It’s world famous for a reason—great to be at the Bucking Horse Sale Parade today! 
SteveDaines,Yeah it’s called the men’s team. 
SteveDaines,As Montanans are facing record high gas prices Biden &amp; the Democrats want to chokehold American energy production. Instead we should be empowering refineries like CHS to produce energy right here in MT.Energy security is national security. Time to unleash American energy! 
SteveDaines,While I’m glad to see a Trump-appointed judge block Biden’s senseless decision the President needs to wake up face reality and secure our southern border for the safety of MT communities.
SteveDaines,It’s outrageous that @JoeBiden even considered rescinding Title 42 in the midst of a historic crisis at our southern border that’s left our country wide open to an influx of illegal drugs &amp; illegal immigrants.
SteveDaines,This morning I had the honor of presenting Major Daniela Ragen with an official tribute in the Congressional Record. Major Ragen served in the Army National Guard and as state coordinator for the Montana National Guard Counterdrug Program. She makes Montana proud! 
SteveDaines,For 100 years the Fort Harrison VA hospital has provided care for Montana veterans who selflessly served our great nation in every war and humanitarian mission since World War I.Glad to be with Montana heroes today to celebrate this historic milestone. 
SteveDaines,.@JoeBiden handing over the US’ sovereignty to the @WHO—which has spent the past two years acting as an arm of the Chinese Communist Party—is unimaginable. This is a direct threat to Americans’ rights &amp; I’m glad to work with @SenTomCotton to stop it. 
SteveDaines,The very point of the First Amendment is to ensure your government will never tell you what you can and can’t say — this Orwellian “Ministry of Truth” does just that.We must NEVER allow Biden or anyone else to censor speech on the taxpayers’ dime. 
SteveDaines,Over a week of record high prices at the pump and Montanans are paying the price. Are we lights on no one home at the White House? Unleash American energy!
SteveDaines,Sat down with Ambassador Brink this morning to discuss her plans to restore U.S. diplomatic presence in Ukraine and support their efforts to help defeat Russia's brutal invasion.She is an excellent pick to lead the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. 
SteveDaines,Congratulations to Ambassador Brink for her confirmation as U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. Her experience and leadership will be an asset for the United States as we continue to stand with Ukraine against Russia. 
SteveDaines,From selective censorship of conservative viewpoints to policies that prop up the far-left’s agenda Big Tech giants have become the newest arm of the Democrat Party. 
SteveDaines,After returning from Ukraine I called on the Biden admin to reopen the Embassy in Kyiv &amp; restore our diplomatic presence in the country.Today it finally happened. We must continue to show Ukraine that America stands with them in their fight for freedom.
SteveDaines,Insanity. 
SteveDaines,Just got off the phone with Jesse Laslovich and thanked him for his willingness to serve. Congratulations to Montana’s new US Attorney.
