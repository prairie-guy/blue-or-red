SenatorLujan,I am praying today and tonight for the families who have lost a loved one and for all those who were injured.
SenatorLujan,Truly sick to my stomach hearing the horrific news coming out of Uvalde Texas. Congress is not doing right by our nation's children. It is shameful. It is unimaginably wrong. This is a parent’s living and worst nightmare. We need to pass meaningful and urgent gun reform now.

SenatorLujan,I’ll be joining @JDBalartMSNBC on @MSNBC soon to talk NM wildfires Title 42 and immigration reform. 
SenatorLujan,43k people didn’t make it home last year from the road. I was almost one of them in my 20s after I got hit by a drunk driver.We HAVE the tech to prevent car accidents. I'm calling on @USDOT to implement the HALT Act to require car companies to install life-saving tech in cars.
SenatorLujan,Congratulations to the Class of 2022! Keep aiming high. Keep achieving. Keep making us proud. Keep making the world a better place. 
SenatorLujan,Thank you @SenTinaSmith for sharing these stories and struggles with mental health. It truly is an honor to serve with a Senator who is so true to herself and has such generosity of heart. I’m thinking of you and all the lives you’re saving right now. 
SenatorLujan,Order your next round of free COVID tests here: 
SenatorLujan,Title 42 was never about public health. It’s always been an attempt to deny asylum to those fleeing violence and persecution. We must undo the harm President Trump did to our border security and immigration system. 
SenatorLujan,I was very saddened to hear of the passing of Edward Jim Sr. a former member of the Navajo Nation Council and Army veteran. He was a beloved member of our community and will be greatly missed.
SenatorLujan,To all of the police officers in New Mexico and across the country: thank you. You put your lives on the line every day to keep your community safe and for that I am forever grateful to you all. #NationalPoliceWeek

SenatorLujan,To honor Mental Health Awareness Month this year I’ve launched an inaugural Mental Health Consortium that will work to solve the mental health crisis our country is facing. 
SenatorLujan,Congress just made it easier for families to buy the baby formula they need using Women Infants &amp; Children benefits. On top of @POTUS invoking the Defense Production Act to increase production it’s going to make a huge difference for moms &amp; families providing for their babies.
SenatorLujan,3 in 4 Americans believe the #EqualRightsAmendment should be a part of our Constitution. Let’s make that a reality. #ERANow

SenatorLujan,Just now I voted to send more aid to Ukraine because I believe it’s our sacred responsibility as one of the top global leaders to help allies in times of crisis.
SenatorLujan,I want to also share a beautiful floor speech my friend @senrobportman made a couple of years back honoring Tim and his service in the Senate and in Washington.
SenatorLujan,I had coffee this week with my buddy Tim O’Neill. Tim has been a public servant for over 30 years and is one of the first smiling faces I see when I go to vote. He is also a stroke survivor and a constant positive force. It’s an honor to work with him in the Senate. 
SenatorLujan,Wondering that myself👇🏼 
SenatorLujan,The creation of the Disinformation Governance Board by DHS was put on hold because…*checks notes*...because of disinformation?Seems like this is something we need now more than ever.
SenatorLujan,When I was a kid my siblings and I would run around on our farm eating tomatoes straight from the vines. They were so sweet like candy.I want that for the next generation. To experience and taste the wonders of our natural world. It's our obligation to protect it for them.
