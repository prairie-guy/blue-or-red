RepGaramendi,I am tired of grieving I am tired of worrying for the well-being of my grandchildren. We must act. Now.
RepGaramendi,This issue doesn’t plague any other major developed nation on earth it’s a conscious decision being made by a radical minority of lawmakers who sacrifice the well-being of our children for the well-being of a group of fringe gun lobbyists.
RepGaramendi,One cannot act surprised and outraged at each of these shootings when they continue to block any of reforms needed to prevent them.
RepGaramendi,I am at a loss for words — this mass shooting has torn yet another 15 young lives from our country. Once again many Members of Congress will post their surprise and anguish over this event without thinking of the role they can play in preventing something like this from happening
RepGaramendi,Putin thinks permanently barring me from entering Russia will weaken my commitment to democracy and a free Ukraine. Luckily I appreciate California’s national parks so my vacation plans aren’t going to change. Neither will my support for President Zelensky and international law. 
RepGaramendi,Vacaville residents be advised of a wildfire burning near Pleasants Valley Rd. Please see Solano OES for evacuation warnings and warnings to residents nearby. 
RepGaramendi,The rights that generations of women have fought for are under attack. It’s unacceptable that my grandchildren could live in a country with fewer rights than the one their parents grew up in. We must stand up for what is right we must stand up for Roe. 
RepGaramendi,The so-called “great replacement theory” is nothing other than the same racist malarkey white supremacists have peddled for generations repackaged for prime time Fox News. This rhetoric isn’t just hateful — it’s killing our neighbors our friends and loved ones. It must end now
RepGaramendi,I was disappointed that a majority of my Republican colleagues decided to play politics and not support this critically important effort. @HouseDemocrats are dedicated to addressing the needs of working people and I will work tirelessly to ensure this legislation becomes law.
RepGaramendi,Yesterday I voted for two bills to immediately address the baby formula shortage. This will help get formula on the shelves at a reasonable price and head off future shortages.
