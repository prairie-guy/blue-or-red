RepFranklin,Strawberries are a critical FL crop. Thiram is a fungicide that ensures a strong crop. @EPA proposed a ban on Thiram w/conflicting data. I led a letter w/ @RepDarrenSoto urging @EPA to reconsider. We need ALL data before such an economically devastating decision is finalized. 
RepFranklin,As a retired Naval Aviator I thank our men and women of the Armed Forces past and present. Happy #ArmedForcesDay! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

RepFranklin,Iâ€™m glad to see DHS shut down its â€˜Ministry of Truthâ€™ after more than 190 of my colleagues joined me on my letter to express our concerns to Secretary Mayorkas. Itâ€™s time for DHS to focus its efforts on priority issues like the border crisis and keeping the homeland safe.
RepFranklin,The deliberate disregard for the rule of law on our southern border by @POTUS is a national security threat. We must secure our nation's borders.
