SenatorDurbin,I implore – beg – my Republican colleagues to join Democrats in finally making changes to our gun laws to help prevent Americans from re-living this gun tragedy far too often. We cannot continue to sit on our hands and allow innocent lives to be lost. Congress must act.
SenatorDurbin,Today’s news is heartbreaking and tragic.  Fourteen young lives and a teacher gone far too soon.  My heart is with the families and friends of these lives lost.
SenatorDurbin,These former ATF Directors and leaders are rallying behind Steve Dettelbach because they know he is more than adequately prepared to lead the Bureau.ATF hasn’t had a Senate confirmed nominee since 2015. It’s time we get this done. 
SenatorDurbin,Today I'm joining @RepDannyDavis and @RepUnderwood in calling on @DeptVetAffairs to begin helping defrauded veteran student borrowers in Illinois through the Veterans Rapid Retraining Assistance Program Restoration and Recovery Act as soon as possible.Our letter: 
SenatorDurbin,Last week the House passed a bill to address the infant formula shortage. 190 Republicans objected. I’m live on the floor calling on Senate Republicans to avoid that kind of hypocrisy and join Dems to pass this bill ASAP. Watch: 
SenatorDurbin,It was an honor speaking at @Augustana_IL College’s Commencement Ceremony. I have great hope for the future generation of problem solvers and peacemakers. Congratulations Class of 2022. 
SenatorDurbin,ATF has not had a Senate-confirmed Director since 2015. Mr. Dettelbach is a highly respected former U.S. Attorney and career prosecutor with decades of experience countering extremism including domestic terrorism. He is well equipped to lead this agency. 
SenatorDurbin,The census recount should give pause to all of the critics who were so quick to peddle the Illinois desertion scenario. We have our challenges (ever read about the Chicago Fire?) but we need to face them honestly and not spread a tale of gloom and doom. 
SenatorDurbin,My mother who escaped the tyranny of the Russian Czar in 1911 would have been so proud to know that I am #257 of the 1000 officially banned from Russia by Vladimir Putin. God save Ukraine! 
SenatorDurbin,We can’t keep repeating the same mistakes and then saying that no one is to blame when civilians are killed. We must do better than this. That's why I support @SenWarren's bills to overhaul civilian harm prevention and transparency. 
SenatorDurbin,Praying for the victims of yet another devastating mass shooting which happened last night in Chicago. All of us must do our part to reduce the gun violence that plagues communities across America. We must not give up.
SenatorDurbin,This morning I joined Gamaliel of Metro Chicago and Illinois Catholic ministry leaders to discuss immigration policy and its impact on our local communities. I commend their dedication in supporting and uplifting immigrant communities in Chicago. 
SenatorDurbin,Buffalo is not the first time Discord nor Twitch have been used to fuel hatred and domestic violent extremism. It is essential that Congress understand what social media platforms are doing to address efforts by violent extremists to recruit plan and amplify their attacks. 
SenatorDurbin,In the face of an unprecedented pandemic IL small businesses have showed great resilience while Democrats worked persistently to provide them with the aid they needed. Disappointed but not surprised my Republican colleagues blocked vital relief for small businesses yesterday.
SenatorDurbin,ICYMI here’s the truth about what’s happening in red state governments right now: 
SenatorDurbin,13 states including OK have trigger laws that would automatically ban abortion in the first &amp; second trimesters if Roe is overturned. Between this and what's happening within the walls of SCOTUS it has never been more urgent to codify the right to access an abortion into law. 
SenatorDurbin,This emergency aid will help Ukraine withstand the next brutal phase of this war and prevent Putin from spreading his malevolent war into other nations. By passing this necessary aid we are sending a message to the Ukrainian people: the United States Congress stands with you. 
SenatorDurbin,.@SenAlexPadilla has a bipartisan bill that would give documented dreamers a pathway to citizenship. I’ve joined this effort because not only have these young people grown up in America—they are making it a better place. I urge my colleagues to join us and get this done. 
SenatorDurbin,Speaking live on the Senate floor: 
SenatorDurbin,Met with @eBay CEO Jamie Iannone yesterday to discuss my INFORM Consumers Act which eBay supports. This bill will help ensure that shady sellers don't use online marketplaces to hawk stolen or counterfeit products to unsuspecting consumers. Congress should pass it without delay. 
SenatorDurbin,Yesterday I met with Illinois law enforcement leaders during #PoliceWeek to discuss the need to provide funding and resources to address mental health and recruitment and retention challenges facing law enforcement. I am grateful for their leadership and service. 
SenatorDurbin,This week I introduced a bipartisan resolution with @marcorubio to not only honor Vladimir Kara-Murza but condemn his unjust detention as well. I will continue to work with my colleagues to call for his immediate release. 
SenatorDurbin,Vladimir Kara-Murza is a fearless Russian patriot and leader for democracy who I have had the honor of meeting a few times. Despite being poisoned twice by the Kremlin he heroically continues to stand up to Putin and advocate for the Russian and Ukrainian people.
SenatorDurbin,As Putin’s war rages on I am steadfast in my support for the Baltic States as they stand against Russian aggression. This resolution builds on our continued work to support the Baltics—I look forward to the next 100 years of friendship between our nations.
SenatorDurbin,There's nothing ghost-like about ghost guns. This is a common sense step that will save lives. Closing gaps in gun laws funding community violence intervention programs and addressing the root causes of gun violence including trauma will help make Illinois safer. 
SenatorDurbin,Americans deserve to know what is in their dietary supplements. That’s why Congress should pass my bipartisan Dietary Supplements Listing Act—which would bring improved safety and transparency to the dietary supplement market.
SenatorDurbin,Speaking live on the Senate floor: 
SenatorDurbin,It is noteworthy that Police Week falls during Mental Health Awareness Month. The Judiciary Committee will use this opportunity not just to pause and honor our law enforcement officers and their families but also to take action to improve mental health resources for them. 
SenatorDurbin,The decision to have an abortion is deeply personal for every American. If you are interested share your story below to help continue the fight to protect this essential freedom in Congress. 
SenatorDurbin,Perpetrators committing unspeakable war crimes such as those unfolding before our very eyes in Ukraine must be held to account. We have the power and responsibility to ensure that the United States will not be used as a safe haven by the perpetrators of these heinous crimes.
