RepTomRice,South Carolina now has one of the strongest election laws in the country. Congratulations to the SC Legislature for passing legislation that secures absentee voting and makes election laws uniform across every county in the state. 
RepTomRice,President Biden is continuing to break all the wrong records. For the first time the average price for a gallon of gas is over $4 in ALL 50 states. South Carolinians are paying 50% more for gas compared to last year. #Bidenflation 
RepTomRice,3 weeks too late but Biden has officially abandoned his “Disinformation Governance Board.” I gladly cosponsored legislation last week to put an end to this senseless 1st Amendment overreach by the Biden Administration.
