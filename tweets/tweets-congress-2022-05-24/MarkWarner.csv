MarkWarner,My heart is with all those affected by the shooting in Uvalde. There are no words to express the magnitude of this tragedy. Gun violence is taking far too many lives. Congress must act.
MarkWarner,Lowering costs matters to me so I’m working on a variety of fronts to make that happen. Recently I secured $115 million to expand affordable housing in VA. And I’m working every day to get our competition bill done and increase American manufacturing.
MarkWarner,I’m incredibly disappointed that my colleagues couldn’t come together last week to support a bipartisan initiative to give small business owners the support they need as they continue to deal with the effects of the pandemic. I’ll keep pushing for laws that help small businesses.
MarkWarner,Every family has been affected by mental health struggles at some point. It shouldn’t be shameful whatsoever. I’m thankful my friend @SenTinaSmith and others are working to break down the stigma. 
MarkWarner,Got to stop at Doumar’s this weekend — one of my favorite Hampton Roads spots and the home of the world’s first waffle cone! 
MarkWarner,Big congrats to the Virginia men’s tennis team for bringing home yet another national title this weekend! #wahoowa
MarkWarner,These dogs will finally know love! So glad USDA heeded our calls and brought these animals to safety and I can’t wait for them to be adopted by Virginia families. 
MarkWarner,Honored to attend the ribbon cutting for oLab today. With the relocation of groundbreaking companies and the expansion of cutting edge innovation labs in Virginia we’re going to keep solving problems and making critical breakthroughs right here in the Commonwealth. 
MarkWarner,Great morning speaking with employees at Interos — a Virginia-based company doing great work to get businesses the data they need to create a strong reliable supply chain. 
MarkWarner,#BannedFromRussia! At least I’m in good company. 
MarkWarner,Even senators’ cars break down sometimes — glad to get stuck in Richmond and not on the side of I-95 like @timkaine! 
MarkWarner,Great afternoon at the 24th Annual Asian American Celebration! Especially during AAPI Heritage Month I’m glad to honor the diversity and history of Asian Americans in Virginia. 
MarkWarner,Incredibly honored to speak with the Virginia PTA today and receive an honorary lifetime membership. COVID has been very tough on schools but I’m inspired by how PTAs educators and students have risen to the occasion. 
MarkWarner,Just met with forestry industry leaders (and future leaders!) in Richmond. Enjoyed seeing some of the cutting edge technologies and products that are making their work safer and more efficient. 
MarkWarner,Pleased that @ODNIgov and @USOPM issued new federal investigative standards for security clearances and other positions of trust. It's an important step forward to modernize an outdated system as part of the Trusted Workforce 2.0 initiative.
MarkWarner,I applaud our Canadian partners for this important decision to eliminate untrustworthy vendors from Canadian communications networks. I would encourage the Admin to build on past efforts and more broadly encourage allies &amp; trading partners to do likewise. 
MarkWarner,HUGE NEWS: USDA heeded my call and took action rescuing 145 beagles from inhumane conditions. So glad these dogs are safe and ready to see further accountability for those involved.
MarkWarner,Just toured the Norfolk Harbor with  @ShalandaYoung46 @BobbyScott and others. We’re securing investments in offshore wind natural disaster resiliency and harbor widening to strengthen the economy and safety of the whole region. 
MarkWarner,Today I’m joining Shalanda Young and some of my friends in Hampton Roads to announce huge federal investments in the region — strengthening our ports and safeguarding against natural disasters. I’m proud IIJA and other initiatives I supported made this happen. 
MarkWarner,This is important progress. After advocating for changes like this and introducing CFAA reforms I’m glad to see clarification that protects vital security research. 
MarkWarner,Glad to meet with Steve Dettelbach today. I look forward to seeing him confirmed as head of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives so he can use his extensive law enforcement experience to tackle violent crime.
MarkWarner,I’m pleased that the Senate took action today to allow parents to purchase additional kinds of formula with WIC benefits because all families deserve equal opportunity to feed their children. I’ll keep up the pressure on other initiatives until this issue is solved.
MarkWarner,We saw it with the white supremacist march in Charlottesville – champions of “Great Replacement Theory” have been around for years and they haven’t been condemned harshly enough. Hate should have no home in America.
MarkWarner,I’m for cutting costs for families. So this week I worked towards securing support for affordable housing and school lunches. Next up I want the Senate to cap insulin copays at $35/month and cut costs for ALL prescription drugs.
MarkWarner,I just voted yes on Ukraine aid which includes money for refugee aid medicine weaponry governmental support and more. From the beginning America has stood firmly with Ukraine. This is another key step in actively supporting them through this brutal conflict. 
MarkWarner,We need a thorough examination of our supply chain. I’m calling for immediate action to address the snares that are affecting baby formula and longer term actions to restore American manufacturing.
MarkWarner,Congress should keep its promise to small businesses and replenish the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. I’ve worked tirelessly with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to get this done. I’ll be voting yes today and I hope my colleagues stand with small businesses and do the same.
MarkWarner,Yesterday I met with Michael Barr to further vet his nomination to the Fed. The Fed is an excellent tool to curb inflation and build an economy that works for all so I take my responsibility to consider all nominees extremely seriously. 
MarkWarner,As Congress works through the bipartisan competition bill we can’t lose sight of the fact that our issue is with the Chinese Communist Party of Xi Jinping not with the Chinese people and certainly not with the Chinese Americans who have contributed so much to our nation.
MarkWarner,My mom battled Alzheimer’s for 10 years – which is why I’m always working in Congress to make sure that we’re supporting research for a cure. I was proud to introduce bills this week alongside @SenCollins and others to accelerate the pace of research.
MarkWarner,Every student deserves a nutritious lunch and schools need to be able to avoid bureaucracy to make that happen. That’s why I’m supporting @SenStabenow’s Support Kids Not Red Tape Act which will extend a pandemic benefit and support kids and schools.
