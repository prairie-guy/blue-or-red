RepPeteAguilar,I was thrilled to present $1 million to the City of Upland to help build the new Tom Thomas Magnolia Plaza in the heart of downtown. This is going to strengthen our small businesses which are the backbone of our economy. Proud to help secure this funding to help our communities. 
RepPeteAguilar,I just voted to stop Big Oil from #RippingOffAmericans and help lower prices at the pump by:✅ Ending price gouging✅ Penalizing market manipulators✅ Bringing transparency to the energy market to help consumers
RepPeteAguilar,For 25 years the @NewDemCoalition has worked to get things done for the American people. New Dems have been at the forefront of some of the most successful legislative efforts in recent history and we’re not done yet. I’m proud to be a #NewDem. #25YearsofNewDems
