RepLeeZeldin,The illegal crossings and drugs flowing into our country daily have created a full-blown crisis at our southern border. We MUST ramp up border security NOW! 
RepLeeZeldin,Honored to march in the @CelebrateIsrael Parade yesterday in NYC. The US-Israel bond must forever remain unbreakable. 
RepLeeZeldin,Prior to the start of yesterday's Celebrate Israel Parade in NYC it was an honor to stand alongside several strong Nassau County leaders including @NassauExec in opposition to rising antisemitism on our streets in our schools and inside of government. 
RepLeeZeldin,Non-citizens should never be permitted to vote in any of our elections. NYC is starting up non-citizen voting for the November 2023 election. This trend must be reversed. One person one vote is an American principle and right that belongs solely to US citizens.

RepLeeZeldin,Great news coming out of Louisiana tonight. A federal judge just blocked the Biden Administration from ending Title 42. We MUST ramp up border security big time not weaken it.
RepLeeZeldin,Army vet Hason Correa was ruthlessly murdered in 2018 &amp; 2 of his killers are being handed garbage plea deals/reduced sentences by Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg. The Correa family deserves justice! A reminder Gov Hochul must fire Alvin Bragg for refusing to enforce the law. My letterâ¬‡ 
RepLeeZeldin,As gas prices hit yet another record high itâ€™s clearer than ever that American energy production must be ramped up today. Bring back US energy independence!
RepLeeZeldin,Fentanyl illegal immigrants human trafficking etc. The border needs to SHUT DOWN TODAY to ALL OF IT! No more handouts. No more Biden travel agency. No more rewards. No more Mayorkas as DHS Secretary. ENOUGH!! ðŸ˜¡ Ramp up border security and enforce the rule of law!
