RepBalderson,"This is NOT an ""incredible transition"" as @POTUS claims. It IS cruel and avoidable. It's past time to end this war on American energy and boost production here at home! "
RepBalderson,Keeping Title 42 in place is the right decision for public safety! 
RepBalderson,Families are hurting because of the Biden Admin's anti-American energy agenda.It's time to #FlipTheSwitch on American energy and unleash the abundant energy resources we have here at home. 
RepBalderson,Bureaucrats must be held accountable and the @US_FDA must ensure this never happens again.
RepBalderson,Throwing more money at incompetence is not the solution.Coverage of the shortage largely ignores the fact that the Biden FDA knew it had a role to play in allowing the manufacturer to restart production and did nothing to bring operations back online. 
RepBalderson,The FDA knew about these problems for months and did nothing to get the production plant back online w/ proper oversight until now.Questions need to be answered bureaucrats need to be held accountable and safeguards need to be put in place to ensure this never happens again.
RepBalderson,The ongoing baby formula shortage is yet another crisis of the Biden Administration’s own making–and it’s putting our most vulnerable Americans in jeopardy. @US_FDA 
RepBalderson,For the 9th consecutive day gas prices have shattered ALL-TIME HIGHS because the Biden Administration refuses to unleash American energy. #FlipTheSwitch #EnergyIndependence
