RepJeffDuncan,The average gas price in South Carolina today is $4.29. That's up from $4.22 just a week ago $3.78 a month ago &amp; $2.85 a year ago (AAA). South Carolinians can't afford Joe Biden's self-imposed #EnergyCrisis all because he refuses to end his war on American energy production.‚õΩÔ∏è
RepJeffDuncan,We're struggling under the weight of surging gas prices/rising costs &amp; @POTUS could end his war on American energy w/ the stroke of a pen by utilizing our abundant natural resources. Instead he decides to tap the reserves doing nothing to solve the root cause of the crisis. 
RepJeffDuncan,Joe Biden continues to be a record-breaking president in all the wrong ways. 
RepJeffDuncan,Energy security = national security. Domestic energy production is more than just decreasing pain at the gas pump for Americans ‚Äì it's a matter of our national security.
RepJeffDuncan,Specialist Four Charles Johnson Jr. was killed in action in March 1966 in Vietnam &amp; was the 1st casualty from Pickens County. We're forever thankful for his sacrifice for our country. The House passed a bill I introduced H.R. 92 to rename a Pickens post office in his memory.üá∫üá∏ 
RepJeffDuncan,Private First Class Barrett Lyle Austin lost his life from injuries sustained during an attack in Afghanistan in 2013 &amp; deserves our appreciation for paying the ultimate sacrifice. Last week the House passed a bill I introduced to rename an Easley post office in his memory. üá∫üá∏ 
RepJeffDuncan,We cannot say thank you enough to our Armed Forces for their courage and sacrifice. God Bless these brave men and women for serving our country! üá∫üá∏ 
RepJeffDuncan,Great visit checking in with @SCPorts to hear from them about this industry that benefits all of SC. I'm proud to see all they do to keep shipping a thriving industry that economically impacts the entire state &amp; look forward to our continued work together. Thanks for having me! 
RepJeffDuncan,.@POTUS should unleash domestic energy production to end his war on American energy. RT if you agree!
RepJeffDuncan,Censoring speech to kowtow to the CCP is never a good idea @Microsoft  
RepJeffDuncan,Dems first deflected the blame for sky-high gas prices on COVID then Putin &amp; now price gouging. Biden absolutely did this &amp; this is a direct result of his war on American energy. This is not because of price gouging ‚Äì this is because of Biden's America-last energy policy. 
RepJeffDuncan,Does Biden want higher gas prices? It seems so given his war on American energy and refusal to change course. Check out this @WSJ perspective on the president's self-sabotaging approach to American energy. 
RepJeffDuncan,Gas prices are at a new record-high nationwide (AAA) and continue to climb due to Joe Biden's war on American energy. The #BidenPriceHike could be reversed by unleashing domestic energy production. It's time to #FliptheSwitch on American energy to solve the energy crisis. 
RepJeffDuncan,"BREAKING: The Biden Administration has reportedly paused its Orwellian ""Disinformation Governance Board"" after facing heavy backlash. We are fighting back and winning!"
