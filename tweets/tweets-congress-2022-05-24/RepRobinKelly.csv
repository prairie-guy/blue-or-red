RepRobinKelly,Today some parents in #Uvalde Texas will experience the worst day of their lives - panicked rushing to pick up their child from school but learning their child will never come home. Too many parents know this pain. It's despicable. We can't go on like this.
RepRobinKelly,Reminder: 192 House Republicans voted against solving the baby formula issue and ALL voted against lowering gas prices by holding Big Oil companies accountable. When times get tough the @GOP is quick to speak but when it’s time to deliver for the people they don’t step up.
RepRobinKelly,Every year on this date we celebrate the incredible life of Harvey Milk. While his assassination reminds us of the violence that members of the LGBTQ+ community suffer his accomplishments reminds us how important and influential those same members are to our country. 
RepRobinKelly,103 years ago the House passed the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote but it wasn’t until the following August that it was ratified by 3/4 of the states. It took decades for the women’s suffrage movement to celebrate this triumph but their hard work paid off.
RepRobinKelly,29 years ago the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 was signed into law to enhance voting opportunities for every American. As we see attacks on voting rights all over the country I call on the Senate to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.
RepRobinKelly,I am proud to take this bipartisan step forward for #healthequity alongside my colleagues @RepBrianFitz @RepYvetteClarke @RepCardenas &amp; @GKButterfield. 
RepRobinKelly,Tomorrow is #ClinicalTrialsDay &amp; today I am proud to introduce the NIH Clinical Trial Diversity Act.  This bill will strengthen scientific outcomes by enhancing the inclusion of women racially &amp; ethnically diverse people &amp; people of all ages in all NIH-funded clinical trials. 
RepRobinKelly,Mad about high gas prices? So am I. Big Oil companies are #RippingOffAmericans. They’re making record profits and using it to benefit executives and shareholders. That’s why I voted in support of the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act. It’s time to hold them accountable.
RepRobinKelly,I am tired of being the only country in the world where these things continue to happen. The best way to honor those whom we’ve lost because of the lack of sensible gun laws is to continue to fight in Congress for these laws. 
RepRobinKelly,About 50% of infant formula sold nationwide is purchased by low-income families who rely on WIC benefits.  Today I will vote to improve WIC participants’ access to formula products and ensure they are not left behind. #FeedOurInfants 
RepRobinKelly,@RepLucyMcBath Thank you for sharing your story my friend!
RepRobinKelly,It was my pleasure to watch @Governors_State award Father Michael Pfleger with an honorary degree. His long career in gun violence prevention work and promoting social justice issues and public service from his parish on the South Side of Chicago has made our communities better.
