RepTenney,I support H.R. 4828 the Border Security for America Act to build the wall invest in critical infrastructure and support federal law enforcement. 
RepTenney,ICYMI: I unveiled a plan to secure the border where I highlighted legislation I support in Congress to prioritize America First and uphold the rule of law. Read the full plan at the link below. 
RepTenney,Congratulations to @MVCC_UticaRome &amp; @BinghamtonU on their recent Upward Bound grants! As we grapple with the long-term impacts of COVID lockdowns these projects are more important now than ever before to invest in our children's future. Read more below!
RepTenney,Older New Yorkers are struggling to keep up with soaring prices which are a direct result of Biden‚Äôs policies.  Here‚Äôs a message I recently received from a Chenango County resident who‚Äôs having a difficult time keeping up with rising prices. 
RepTenney,It‚Äôs been a week since the Senate primary in Pennsylvania and we still don‚Äôt know who won. Election officials in PA should be clear about how many ballots are outstanding and from where. Transparency is key to election integrity! #ElectionIntegrityCaucus
RepTenney,The Iranian people are the longest suffering victims of the Islamic Republic‚Äôs brutality and they have had enough! It‚Äôs time for President Biden to stand with a majority of Iranians who oppose this repressive clerical regime. 
RepTenney,Biden the MLB and other Democrat activists lied to you claiming Georgia‚Äôs new election integrity law would suppress voter turnout.  It's no wonder that they‚Äôre silent as early voting turnout is now 3x higher than it was for the same election in 2018!
RepTenney,57% of small business owners are expecting economic conditions in the US to worsen over the next year.  President Biden‚Äôs out-of-control spending continues to have devastating impacts on our small business community.
RepTenney,Today I‚Äôm highlighting my Border Security Plan to secure the border prioritize America First and uphold the rule of law. Read more at the link below! (2/2)
RepTenney,President Biden‚Äôs lax immigration policies have created a crisis at the Southern Border. New Yorkers are paying the price with flights of illegal immigrants arriving in the dead of night and deadly drugs like fentanyl flooding our streets. (1/2)
RepTenney,I've heard from many seniors who are juggling record gas prices ($4.93 in NY) high grocery bills &amp; many more costs.   The Biden Price Hike is NOT sustainable. Congress should take up my resolution creating a Select Committee on Older Americans to provide immediate relief!
RepTenney,The Biden Admin expected up to 18000 daily border crossings 3x the current average following the end of Title 42.Yet they STILL tried to terminate it today WITHOUT a plan to secure the border.We should build the wall &amp; invest in proven technologies. #BidenBorderCrisis
RepTenney,The days of squandering your taxpayer dollars on failed institutions abroad are over. The #WHO bowed to China and lacks transparency and accountability. This organization &amp; others must be reformed. I will always defend the sanctity of America‚Äôs sovereignty and our Constitution.
RepTenney,I joined with my friend @RepStefanik to introduce the HALT our Adversaries Act to ensure US taxpayer dollars do not help our adversaries like Russia and China modernize or increase their military capabilities.
RepTenney,Federal retirement funds should not be invested in risky Chinese companies.I joined my colleagues in calling on the Dept of Labor to stop investing your money in Chinese companies that pose a threat to US national security or engage in human rights abuses. 
RepTenney,On National Armed Forces Day I want to sincerely thank all the brave men and women who honorably defend our Nation! 
RepTenney,My weekly newsletter is out! Click the link below to read more about my work in Washington and across #NY22 on behalf of our communities. 
RepTenney,üö®BREAKING: Judge Rules Title 42 to Remain in Place. This is a positive step!Biden‚Äôs plan to remove Title 42 without a plan in place to secure the border would have been a disaster.
RepTenney,The Biden Admin is totally out of touch with the needs of the American people.It‚Äôs no wonder that his approval rating just hit 39% and only 20% say the US is heading in the right direction according to a new AP poll.
RepTenney,Last year US households spent an average of $2800 a year on gasoline.This year households will spend nearly DOUBLE THAT - $5000! The root cause? President Biden‚Äôs policies hamstring domestic energy production like canceling oil and gas lease sales.
RepTenney,Biden‚Äôs economic illiteracy is dangerous. His inflationary policies are wiping out Americans‚Äô hard-earned gains and making it harder to make ends meet. Raising taxes will only hurt American workers and do nothing to solve the inflation crisis. 
RepTenney,It‚Äôs a privilege to announce the projects I submitted this year to the House Appropriations Committee for consideration as part of the Fiscal Year 2023 Community Project Funding process! Visit my website at  to find detailed information about each project. 
RepTenney,I was honored to join with my colleagues today to introduce the Women‚Äôs Bill of Rights Resolution which rejects woke ideologies and protects the rights of women. (2/2)
RepTenney,Women have fought long and hard to secure the freedoms that are rightly theirs. Redefining gender to fit woke ideological viewpoints is quite the hypocritical stance for the ‚Äúparty of science.‚Äù Here‚Äôs a quick refresher: XX chromosomes = women. It‚Äôs as simple as that. (1/2) 
RepTenney,I supported the Access to Baby Formula Act to expand access to formula for families participating in the WIC program. This includes nearly 50% of ALL families with an infant.If you live in #NY22 and need help tracking down formula call my office at 202-225-3665 for assistance. 
RepTenney,Today Democrats are bringing up a bill to INCREASE costly government controls over our energy sector.It‚Äôs the totally WRONG approach. We don‚Äôt need MORE government to drive down costs. What we need is MORE domestic energy production and Joe Biden continues to block it.
RepTenney,Just over 40000 migrants were stopped at the Southern Border in Dec 2020 the last full month of the Trump Admin.Last month there were nearly 235000.It‚Äôs time to restart construction on the wall &amp; invest in proven technologies to secure the border. #BidenBorderCrisis
RepTenney,If you or someone you know needs help locating baby formula please contact my office at 202-225-3665. We are here to help! 
RepTenney,Honored to support passage of a bill tonight to ensure a wider range of baby formulas reach the most vulnerable. Next step is action by Biden to lift regulatory barriers that limit production &amp; remove restrictions that prevent well-regulated formulas from being imported. (1/2)
RepTenney,When asked this week about inflation Biden‚Äôs new Press Secretary couldn‚Äôt even answer the question. That shows you just how seriously he‚Äôs taking this economic crisis. Personnel is policy.
RepTenney,Today @PressSec tried once again to pin BIDEN‚ÄôS ENERGY CRISIS on Putin. I busted this myth in my recent @WSJopinion piece. The underlying driver of our current crisis is Biden‚Äôs anti-energy policies.Read more belowüëá
RepTenney,.@SBAgov illicitly forgave nearly $70 million in pandemic relief loans to Planned Parenthood.I‚Äôm leading the charge to rescind the same amount that the SBA provided in loan forgiveness from their Slush Fund for FY23.NO to taxpayer funded abortions.
RepTenney,üö®BREAKING: Biden‚Äôs Ministry of Truth is ‚Äúon pause.‚Äù He NEVER should have created it in the first place. It‚Äôs up to the federal government to PROTECT free speech not silence it.I‚Äôm continuing my fight in Congress to make sure this unconstitutional plan is never revived.
RepTenney,Energy prices are already at record highs. Now the Biden Admin is going to make oil &amp; gas even more expensive. Instead of making us reliant on Russia the US must start producing our energy at home &amp; ensuring these well-paying jobs go to American workers.
