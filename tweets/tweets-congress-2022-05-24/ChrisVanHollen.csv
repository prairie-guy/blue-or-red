ChrisVanHollen,Horrific beyond words.  Every parent’s worst nightmare. We are failing our nation’s children and their teachers by acting as though these mass shootings are normal or unavoidable. 
ChrisVanHollen,It’s great to be back home after a long week. I’m grateful for the generous outpouring of support from everyone and the dedicated care I received from the team at GW. 
ChrisVanHollen,In the meantime I want to make clear where I stand on 2 issues up for a vote today: providing additional aid to Ukraine &amp; relief for restaurants &amp; small businesses still weathering the pandemic. While I won’t be present to vote on these bills they’ve got my strong support.
ChrisVanHollen,A heartfelt thank you to everyone for the outpouring of well-wishes and kind messages. I’m on the mend and on track for a full recovery and following my doctors' orders I’ll begin to ease back into my schedule.
