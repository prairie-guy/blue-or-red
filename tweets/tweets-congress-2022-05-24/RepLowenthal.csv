RepLowenthal,To qualify for special enrollment consumers must have a qualifying life event and enroll within 60 days from the date of that event. See if you qualify today.  2/2
RepLowenthal,Did you know can enroll in or make changes to your Covered California health insurance plan outside the normal open enrollment period which runs Nov. 1 thru Jan. 31? 1/2
RepLowenthal,These are all steps in an “all of the above” approach to solving the formula shortage. We must also think long term &amp; explore ways to increase competition in the market and not have only four companies produce 90% of the formula in the U.S. 4/4
RepLowenthal,That means U.S. infant formula manufacturers can now begin to add legally-binding language to their orders with raw material suppliers that will give these formula manufacturers priority over other customers &amp; allow them to speed up production. 3/4
RepLowenthal,Operation Fly Formula has sped up the normal time to transport European formula to the U.S. from 2 weeks to 3 days. The Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services also authorized the first 2 “priority orders” under the Defense Production Act which the President invoked last week. 2/4
RepLowenthal,The first flight-load of formula under Pres. Biden’s Operation Fly Formula landed yesterday in the U.S. w/35 tons of specialty infant formula. A second flight later this week will increase the amount brought in from Europe to the equivalent of 1.5M 8oz bottles. 1/4
RepLowenthal,LA County hospitals are again filling with COVID patients &amp; the county has now been elevated to the CDC’s ‘middle’ level on the agency’s 3-tier system. It’s critical to keep up to date w/your vaccinations test when ill exposed or gathering &amp; mask indoors when in public.
RepLowenthal,As state legislatures across the country attack LGBTQ+ youth and particularly trans and nonbinary kids I am committed to helping realize Harvey Milk's vision of a world where all LGBTQ+ youth can reach their full potential and live free from discrimination. #HarveyMilkDay
RepLowenthal,I was extremely disappointed to see CA Senate bill 953 banning offshore oil &amp; gas drilling in state waters defeated this week after intense lobbying by the oil industry. The recent OC oil spill showed us: where you drill you spill. We must find the political will to act.
RepLowenthal,By deliberately keeping production low oil execs are making record profits on the backs of hardworking CA families. We need this legislation to crack down on this shameful exploitation hold these corporations accountable &amp; slash costs at the pump across. 2/2
RepLowenthal,I was proud to vote this week for the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act to crack down on price gouging by oil companies. It’s unconscionable that oil companies are taking advantage of Putin’s senseless aggression to hike gas prices. 1/2
RepLowenthal,Political considerations should not override public health and WHO’s values. Without Taiwan’s participation the world will be less informed less safe and less prepared for the next global health crisis. 3/3
RepLowenthal,However between 2009 and 2019 @WHO rejected 130 out of Taiwan’s 187 applications to take part in technical meetings. Since President Tsai was elected in 2016 China has succeeded in pressuring WHO to limit Taiwan’s participation in the World Health Assembly. 2/3
RepLowenthal,By many accounts Taiwan has mounted one of the best responses of any country to the pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) would clearly benefit from hearing from Taiwanese health policy experts at the upcoming #WorldHealthAssembly. 1/3

RepLowenthal,That’s why I voted for legislation yesterday that will help #FeedOurInfants by providing the FDA with emergency funding and the resources it needs to address this shortage. 2/2
RepLowenthal,I am horrified by the recent infant formula shortages I have seen. Going to the grocery store &amp; seeing empty shelves with no infant formula in sight is distressing for any parent. We must ensure families always have access to safe formula. 1/2
RepLowenthal,Proud to help advance the 2022 Water Resources Development Act yesterday w/the unanimous votes of all my T&amp;I Committee colleagues. This bill secures critical resources for our community-- supporting ecosystem restoration &amp; critical port funding to strengthen our supply chains.
RepLowenthal,In addition it provides funding to allow the FBI DOJ &amp; DHS to assist state local &amp; tribal law enforcement agencies in understanding detecting deterring &amp; investigating acts of domestic terrorism &amp; white supremacy. 4/4
RepLowenthal,That is why last night I voted to pass the bipartisan Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act which provides the resources &amp; tools that law enforcement &amp; our communities need to combat these threats. It also creates 3 domestic terrorism-focused offices within the FBI DOJ &amp; DHS. 3/4
RepLowenthal,As threats &amp; attacks have moved from one community to the next the underlying drivers for domestic violent extremism—anti-government sentiment racism &amp; anti-Semitism—have remained constant. We must give our law enforcement agencies the tools data &amp; training they need. 2/4
RepLowenthal,Federal law enforcement agencies report that domestic violent extremists pose a steady &amp; evolving threat of violence to our communities &amp; especially to minority institutions. Just this weekend domestic terrorists killed 10 people in Buffalo &amp; another in Laguna Woods. 1/4
RepLowenthal,His death is a loss for Orange County in so many ways. I also hope for the speedy recovery of the five people injured and my heart goes out to the people of Laguna Woods. 2/2
RepLowenthal,My heart goes out to the families &amp; loved ones of Dr. John Cheng who was killed during a senseless mass shooting this weekend at the Geneva Presbyterian Church in Laguna Woods. 1/2
RepLowenthal,Today is the International Day Against Homophobia Transphobia and Biphobia an opportunity for us to join together and condemn the bigotry and hatred that still threatens the safety and well-being of our LGBTQ+ friends neighbors and loved ones both at home and abroad.
