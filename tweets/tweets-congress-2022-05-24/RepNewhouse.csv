RepNewhouse,The average American family is expected to spend an additional $5000 a year just on gas. The high cost of gas is not only hurting families it is hurting our farmers producers shippers and truckers. They need relief and the answer is unleashing American energy production. 
RepNewhouse,"""The administrationâ€™s approach is a stopgap measure that does not address the root causes of the shortage."" "
RepNewhouse,"""High gas prices can also further push the U.S. toward an economic downturn as higher fuel costs can impact every supply chain sector from farms to packaging plants to grocery stores."" "
RepNewhouse,Yesterday I participated in a Civics Q&amp;A with the entire 8th grade class of Grandview Middle School. As the next generation of leaders I encourage these bright students to continue to learn form opinions and participate in the democratic process. Keep up the great work! 
RepNewhouse,The gray wolf is a success storyâ€”it's time to listen to the science. I am proud to champion the Trust the Science Act which will strengthen state management and delist gray wolves from the endangered species list. 
RepNewhouse,Drug crime is running rampant throughout our country and across Central Washington exacerbated by the vast quantities of drugs flooding our southern border. We must secure our border now to ensure the safety of ALL of our communities. 
RepNewhouse,The financial burdens of inflation are devastating to families across Central Washington &amp; now families that are required to travel for life-saving medical care are facing additional uncertainties due to costs.This is unacceptableâ€”we must reverse Biden's inflationary policies. 
RepNewhouse,A highlight from this weekend's Veterans Service Fair: Hanford Mission Integration Solutions has a new program Valor which offers career support and resources to veterans!If you or a loved one is a veteran who needs assistance please don't hesitate to contact my office. 
RepNewhouse,With gas prices set to exceed $6 a gallon we MUST open up American energy production. The Democrats' price controls are proven to only make inflation and the price we pay at the pump worse. It's time for real solutions not political pandering. 
RepNewhouse,FYI! Today from 12-4pm I will be hosting a Veterans Service Fair at the 3 Rivers Convention Center in Kennewick. Make sure to stop by to get help with VA benefits and learn about employment opportunities. Read more on my website. 
RepNewhouse,Our freedoms have come at great sacrifice. We thank all of our Armed Forces today and every day for their service and commitment to defending our country. We salute you! 
RepNewhouse,Domestic energy production is integral to our national security and it is more important now than ever that we ensure a reliable energy sector for the American people.The only way to do that is to increase energy production right here at home.
RepNewhouse,Good news for the American people. Now itâ€™s time to regain control of our borders and stop the human trafficking and drug smuggling that has fueled the fentanyl crisis in our communities. 
RepNewhouse,Vehicle theft is running rampant throughout Central Washington. To make matters worse law enforcement cannot pursue and investigate these crimes thanks to state laws that are preventing our police officers from being able to do their jobs.
RepNewhouse,Proud to have voted to authorize this funding which will help enhance water supply sustainability for Central Washington and will improve water delivery to rural communities and producers. 
RepNewhouse,I am currently in contact with emergency management as they continue to investigate this situationâ€”stay safe out there.
RepNewhouse,Congrats Chief Majetich! Thank you for your many years of servant leadership to our community. 
RepNewhouse,"""At Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River daily chinook counts appear to have peaked with a high of 13500 on May 3 but continued to exceed 3000 a day on Monday and Tuesday and jumped north of 6700 on Wednesday."" "
RepNewhouse,I am proud to play a small part in giving back to our veterans by hosting a Veterans Service Fair this Saturday where vets can explore all the resources available to them and get help to receive their hard-earned benefits. 
RepNewhouse,Today marks the 10th day of record-high gas pricesâ€”and to make matters worse Washington state gas stations are running out of fuel.  President Biden must unleash American energy to provide relief to Americans everywhere.

RepNewhouse,For the 9th day in a row gas prices continue to hit new highs. These skyrocketing prices are only expected to get worse under the Biden Administration. 
RepNewhouse,Last week I joined @NWRA_Water for their 2022 Federal Water Issues Conference to discuss the importance of water infrastructure in Central Washingtonâ€”from the irrigation systems we depend on for crop production to our hydroelectric dams which provide clean baseload energy. 
RepNewhouse,The best available science continues to indicate the gray wolf does not meet the definitions of a threatened or endangered species. The Trust the Science Act supports science-based listing decisions that benefit species and local communities.More ðŸ‘‡
RepNewhouse,.@DHSgov just announced they will be pausing their disinformation board after 190 colleagues and I raised concerns about its implications on free speech. The DHS needs to focus on securing our border not being a referee for our Constitutional rights.

RepNewhouse,"""The overharvest and loss of spawning habitat due to upstream dams and human activities occurred before the lower Snake River dams were built."""
