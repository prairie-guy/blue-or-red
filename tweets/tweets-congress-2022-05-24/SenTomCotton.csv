SenTomCotton,Anna and I join all Arkansans in praying for the victims and the childrens’ families in Uvalde.And we’re grateful for law enforcement and the first responders who are helping in the face of this unimaginable evil.
SenTomCotton,President Biden needs to make it clear to the world and to Beijing that our new Taiwan policy is strategic clarity. If China invades we will come to Taiwan’s aid. 
SenTomCotton,It is essential that President Biden declare the United States will come to Taiwan’s defense in the event of a Chinese attack. Continued ambiguity will provoke the Chinese communists without deterring them—the worst of both worlds.
SenTomCotton,The @WHO’s botched response to covid proved its allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party.The U.S. should immediately withdraw from this corrupt organization.
SenTomCotton,The Biden administration’s incompetence caused the nation’s formula shortage. Their response is too little too late. 
SenTomCotton,I’m grateful for officers in Arkansas and across the nation who wake up each morning kiss their families goodbye and go to work—never certain if they’ll make it home. America’s police exemplify the highest attributes of public service and they will always have my support.
SenTomCotton,Each year during Police Week we recognize the brave work of our law enforcement officers. We love and appreciate our police and know that they deserve our support.
SenTomCotton,Our China policy should be strategic decoupling. We cannot depend on the Chinese Communist Party for critical goods that are necessary to our safety health or prosperity. 
SenTomCotton,If you disagree with someone the solution isn’t to use the Department of Homeland Security to censor free speech.
