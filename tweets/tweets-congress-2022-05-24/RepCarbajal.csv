RepCarbajal,Read my full statement: 
RepCarbajal,8 years ago it was Santa Barbara.Today it is Uvalde.Tomorrow it could be students in a classroom anywhere in America.How many more children have to die before those who oppose action realize which side of history they are on?
RepCarbajal,Central Coast parents more formula is on the way!I'm proud to have helped pass these bills which will cut red tape to put more infant formula on shelves and increase imports to ensure parents can feed their children.
RepCarbajal,The climate crisis doesn't just come in the form of extreme storms. Every day rising sea levels are slowly threatening Central Coast communities.But groups like @Surfrider have been working at Surfer's Point in Ventura to combat erosion &amp; preserve our historic coastlines. 
RepCarbajal,As Chair of @TransportDems‚Äôs Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee I'm committed to making sure our Coasties are always mission-ready.Recently I had the opportunity to observe their great work protecting our nation's coastline! 
RepCarbajal,8 years ago today we lost 6 lives in a mass shooting in Isla Vista.Since then hundreds more have died in mass shootings across the U.S.I introduced the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act because enough is enough: Congress must take action to tackle the gun violence epidemic. 
RepCarbajal,Detective Luca Benedetti gave up his life for the safety and protection of SLO residents. I'm glad his memory was honored as a part of #NationalPoliceWeek and I'm grateful to all who've given their lives protecting our communities.
RepCarbajal,I was thrilled to have received so many excellent submissions for the 2022 Congressional Art Competition!Congratulations to our Runners Up Isabella Bonini of @SLOHS_Tigers Brynn Naber of @AGHSEagles and Madeline Kelly of @SanMarcosRoyals! 
RepCarbajal,As a veteran I've always worked to help our servicemembers &amp; their loved ones both during &amp; after their service.On #ArmedForcesDay I‚Äôm grateful for the sacrifices our servicemembers make for our country &amp; I‚Äôll continue to ensure they receive the resources they've earned. 
RepCarbajal,One of the measures that I helped pass to cut red tape and get more infant formula on shelves has been signed into law!I've proud to have been able to deliver swiftly &amp; bring formula to the Central Coast for parents.
RepCarbajal,As Putin continues his brutality in Ukraine I worked to get this $40 billion aid package to @POTUS' desk to provide military aid support for the Ukrainian economy and humanitarian assistance to address the worldwide effects of food shortages caused by Putin's war. 
RepCarbajal,He escuchado directamente de las familias de la Costa Central lo dificil que es consegir f√≥rmula infantil para sus peque√±os.Vot√© para aprobar medidas que ponen m√°s f√≥rmula en las tiendas y reduzca la burocracia para facilitar que las familias alimenten a sus hijos.
RepCarbajal,Another round of free at-home COVID tests are now available! Regular testing keeps us and our loved ones healthy order yours here üëáüèº 
RepCarbajal,Racism in this country is deadly.I joined my colleagues from @HispanicCaucus @TheBlackCaucus &amp; @CAPAC to mourn the victims from Buffalo Dallas Atlanta &amp; too many other communities that have been affected by hate crimes &amp; domestic terrorism.We cannot let hate win. 
RepCarbajal,The Central Coast's housing crisis requires holistic &amp; comprehensive solutions.I'm glad that @POTUS's housing plan addresses this issue by both providing financial aid for homebuyers and creating more housing options.
RepCarbajal,Roe has protected reproductive rights for generations of women and I am fighting to keep it that way‚Äìbut I can't do it alone.If you agree that access to abortion should stay legal use your voice: stand up &amp; speak out! 
RepCarbajal,While Central Coast residents pay record prices at the pump oil companies are making record profits.Even as war in Ukraine disrupted oil markets Big Oil made BILLIONS in profit last quarter.I voted to hold Big Oil accountable &amp; protect Californians from gas price gouging. 
RepCarbajal,Acts of hate &amp; domestic terror in our nation like the one we saw in Buffalo have become too common.Today I voted to pass the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act to prevent any more hateful violent acts of domestic terror &amp; to protect our communities.
RepCarbajal,I've heard firsthand from Central Coast families the burden that infant formula shortages are putting on them and their kids.Today I voted to pass emergency measures that get more formula on store shelves and cut red tape to make it easier for families to feed their children. 
RepCarbajal,High-fives for @NatlHeadStart's 57th birthday!One of my first jobs out of college was working with Head Start. I saw firsthand the impact they made in our community by providing equitable &amp; crucial childhood education to kids who need it the most. 
RepCarbajal,When I came to Washington I joined the @NewDemCoalition ‚Äì a group of House Democrats that are focused on getting legislation signed into law &amp; advancing policies that foster economic growth.Proud to be a #NewDem &amp; celebrate their 25th anniversary this year! #25YearsofNewDems 
RepCarbajal,Issues like climate change &amp; supply chain disruptions have worldwide effects &amp; require collaboration between countries.I met with U.K's Secretary of State of Transport @grantshapps to discuss our nations' decarbonization efforts &amp; how we can relieve supply chain bottlenecks.
