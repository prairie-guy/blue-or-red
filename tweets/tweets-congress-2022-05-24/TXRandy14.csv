TXRandy14,We can protect our children. And how about a law that says let’s take any leftover COVID money and harden our schools so that our students &amp; teachers are protected. And going forward let’s redouble our efforts to teach respect responsibility &amp; values. LORD help us to YOUr values
TXRandy14,I have a bill that retired law-enforcement could be hired by school districts with no income tax charged so that it was inexpensive for the school &amp; didn’t throw the law enforcement professional into a higher tax bracket We can protect our schools: help me get that bill passed.
