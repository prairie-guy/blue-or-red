RepChuyGarcia,15 dead including 14 children at Robb Elementary School in Texas. My thoughts and prayers are with the families but thoughts and prayers have never been and will never be enough. Congress needs to take meaningful action to address the plague of gun violence across our country. 
RepChuyGarcia,ICYMI this weekend I joined @SymoneDSanders on @MSNBC as part of her new show @SymoneMSNBC  along with @CharlesMBlow and @GreisaMartinez to discuss where we go on Title 42 immigration reform and abortion rights. You can watch the full interview and segment below. 
RepChuyGarcia,For the past 60 years @PalenqueLSNA has shown what people-led neighborhood power looks like. Despite the rain community came together to celebrate Palenque LSNA‚Äôs commitment to the Northwest Side. 
RepChuyGarcia,Currently 45 million people across our country hold $1907053693744 in student debt. That is an average of $42378.97 per borrower. It is important that @POTUS takes decisive action to #CancelStudentDebt so we can bring relief to all those struggling under this heavy burden.
RepChuyGarcia,Este fin de semana me sent√≠ como en familia. Gracias a la Comunidad Migrante Duranguese por la oportunidad de conectar con mis paisanos. ¬°Durango est√° presente! ü¶Ç 
RepChuyGarcia,With the stroke of a pen @POTUS can #CancelStudentDebt. 
RepChuyGarcia,Now is the time to be bold and change the game. If @POTUS wants to help energize our economy and help 45 million people and generations across our country to thrive a great way to do that is to #CancelStudentDebt. President Biden can do it today with the stroke of a pen.
RepChuyGarcia,In 15 minutes I‚Äôll be joining @SymoneDSanders on @MSNBC along with @CharlesMBlow and @GreisaMartinez to discuss the need to end Title 42. I hope you‚Äôll tune in. 
RepChuyGarcia,I want to congratulate the CORE leadership slate on their re-election to @CTULocal1 board. I look forward to continuing to work together in partnership to help lift up our communities our students and our teachers. You can always count on me to fight and stand with you. #1u 
RepChuyGarcia,Affordable housing is a human right. Yesterday's ribbon cutting ceremony of the newly named Lucy Gonzalez Parsons Apartments brings hope and opportunity for hundreds of working class families in Logan Square. Here to stay! 
RepChuyGarcia,La decisi√≥n de la corte de continuar el T√≠tulo 42 es da√±ina y usurpa la autoridad del CDC. T√≠tulo 42 fue implementada por orden ejecutiva y toca al Presidente dar la orden para rescindirla. Yo apoyo esta administraci√≥n y espero que sigan luchando por terminar esta cruel pol√≠tica.
RepChuyGarcia,The court decision stopping the end of Title 42 is harmful &amp; usurps @CDCgov authority. It was wrong when CDC ordered it &amp; it is wrong now but it is up to @POTUS when that order should be rescinded. I stand by this administration &amp; hope they will fight to end this cruel policy. 
RepChuyGarcia,You don't have to join #BikeToWorkDday to know the benefits of biking: üëßFreedom for our youthüëµMobility and access for seniorsüí∞ Cost savingsüçÉReduce congestion and pollutionThat‚Äôs why the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $12 billion to give everyone more options.

RepChuyGarcia,Earlier this week I was glad to welcome Illinois Deputy Governors @AndyManar @SolAmoresFlores and @MartinVTorres to my office. I‚Äôm always glad to see folks from back home in DC so that we can find ways to work together across the State and Federal level to help our community.

RepChuyGarcia,Congratulations to Maya Diaz and all grads in the 4th Congressional District on this important milestone as you leave college life and move into the working world! You make all of us very proud. Young people like you are the future of our community state and country. 
RepChuyGarcia,If you want more of my thoughts on why we need to end Title 42 you can read my Op-Ed in @LatinoRebels. 
RepChuyGarcia,Title 42 is a racist policy of the Trump Administration weaponized under the guise of public health to stop Black and Brown migrants from seeking asylum in the US. I stand with my CPC and CHC colleagues against any effort to reinstate Title 42. 
RepChuyGarcia,This isn‚Äôt a time to let our guard down as COVID cases are on the rise. Please make sure to take care of yourselves and your families. If you feel sick stay home. If you have symptoms test. If you‚Äôre in crowded spaces mask up. If you need a booster go to your closest pharmacy. 
RepChuyGarcia,That‚Äôs right @POTUS can #CancelStudentDebt with the stroke of a pen. 
RepChuyGarcia,Abortion is health care. Pass it on. 
RepChuyGarcia,Babies and infants can‚Äôt wait our families need relief. That‚Äôs why I voted for the Access To Baby Formula Act which approves $28 million in emergency funding for @US_FDA to help address the formula shortage. 
RepChuyGarcia,In 10 minutes I‚Äôll be joining @Public_Citizen @SteelWorkers @AFLCIO and others for a special event to discuss big victories for Mexico's independent unions and the role of cross-border solidarity.Join in English:Join in Spanish:
RepChuyGarcia,Union busting is disgusting. There‚Äôs power in a union and clearly @ElonMusk is scared of workers advocating for their rights to safety dignity and respect on the job. 
RepChuyGarcia,Today would be a great day for @POTUS to #CancelStudentDebt.
RepChuyGarcia,Amidst infant formula shortages across the country families are going to bed wondering how they will get their babies the food they need. This is why I am voting to pass urgently needed emergency funding that will help fix this shortage quickly and work to #FeedOurInfants. 
RepChuyGarcia,The labor movement is diverse and strong. @McDonalds workers in Chicago are standing up to demand fair treatment and respect on the job. All workers deserve to be treated fairly I support their right to seek union representation. When unions fight workers win. #UnionsForAll 
RepChuyGarcia,I‚Äôm proud of @USWNT for keeping their eye on the ball and fighting for equality in sports. They scored big time and now will get equal pay for equal work. This is a shining example of workers fighting for their rights and winning. We should all celebrate this momentous victory. 
RepChuyGarcia,It‚Äôs hypocritical that @RepMTG had the choice to become a mother but she doesn‚Äôt want you to have that same choice. Everyone no matter where they come from should have the right to make their own decision and choice about their own reproductive rights. #ProtectRoe
