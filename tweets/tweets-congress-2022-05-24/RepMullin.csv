RepMullin,.@POTUS finally admits what we have all known for months. Hard-working Americans are paying for his Green New Deal agenda at the pumpüëáüëáüëá 
RepMullin,The Biden Admin's decision to tap into the SPR has done nothing to lower gas prices. In fact the price of gas reached a new record high every single day for the past two weeks.Now the admin wants to tap into the emergency diesel reserve too. How is this going to help?
RepMullin,Thank you will never be enough! We owe a debt of gratitude to our Armed Forces that we can never repay. God bless those who have answered the call to serve. üá∫üá∏ 
RepMullin,üö®üö®üö®This is huge news. The crisis at our southern border is bad enough as is. The consequences of repealing this measure would be disastrous. 
RepMullin,The Infant Formula Supplemental Appropriations Act throws $28 million at the FDA with NO plan on how to spend it. Our families deserve real solutions not messaging bills. I‚Äôm glad to support my @HouseGOP colleagues' bills that will actually address this shortage. #WeeklyWrapUp 
RepMullin,I'm glad to join @RepStefanik @cathymcmorris @RepBice &amp; @RepAshleyHinson in their effort to increase infant formula supply.This act will lift restrictions on the importation of formula and hold the FDA accountable in maintaining a healthy supply of baby formula in the future. 
RepMullin,I was proud to support the Access to Baby Formula Act this week. I join @RepSteel in urging @POTUS to sign it into law immediately. These families can't wait. 
RepMullin,"The will of the American people has prevailed. This week @DHSgov announced they have paused their unconstitutional ""disinformation board.""This Ministry of Truth was a bad idea from the start. I'm glad to see it go. "
RepMullin,Let us take this month to remember honor and support our military. They put their lives on the line every day for the safety of our country and our freedoms. God bless our military! 
RepMullin,Thank you to the @alzassociation for taking the time to meet this week. I couldn't be more grateful for the work they do to provide resources advance research and improve the lives of those suffering from Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. 
RepMullin,Democrats have shifted the blame for record-high gas prices so many times they can‚Äôt keep it straight who is to blame. This week? Price gouging.Let me be clear: pain at the pump is DIRECTLY correlated to the Biden Administration‚Äôs assault on American energy.
RepMullin,Today I had the distinct honor of welcoming the Northeast Oklahoma Veterans Freedom Tour to Washington D.C. Our veterans put their lives on the line to defend our freedoms and it's only right they have the chance to visit the memorials and monuments dedicated to their service. 
RepMullin,This is great news for free speech and our Constitution.

RepMullin,Democrats used the second impeachment resolution to once again weaponize one of the most grave and consequential powers of the House. My resolution shows that this was never about the Constitution; it was pure politics and power.Details in @FoxNews ‚¨áÔ∏è
