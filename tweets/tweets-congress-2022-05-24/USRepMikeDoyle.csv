USRepMikeDoyle,Pleased to be part of this initiative by @MadeinSWPA &amp; @iiofpitt to  boost innovation training &amp; peaceful growth between #Ireland and #NorthernIreland. It's another great example of how education &amp; advanced manufacturing in #Pittsburgh can benefit people around the world. 
USRepMikeDoyle,I applaud these investments to fight rising #AntimicrobialResistance made by @BARDA through CARB-X. My bill the PASTEUR Act will accelerate research &amp; investment into lifesaving antibiotics - ensuring that we can prevent the next public health crisis. 
USRepMikeDoyle,What are the main causes of inflation? Hint: ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and China‚Äôs Covid Zero lockdowns are disrupting supply chains hammering growth and pushing inflation to forty-year highs.‚Äù
USRepMikeDoyle,I encourage all of Allegheny County's young people age 14 to 21 to check out the Learn &amp; Earn Summer Youth Employment Program. It provides work experience for young people over the summer and enables them to earn some money as well.
USRepMikeDoyle,I support @POTUS's use of the Defense Production Act to address the baby formula shortage and I voted for the #AccessToBabyFormulaAct. This will ensure manufacturers can ramp up production and get formula to families FAST. #BabiesCantWait üçº
USRepMikeDoyle,Americans are paying the price for #BigOil's corporate greed. As oil companies rake in record profits they‚Äôre forcing working families to pay more with their #PriceGouging. I voted for the #ConsumerFuelPriceGougingPreventionAct to end this abuse. 
USRepMikeDoyle,#AntimicrobialResistance is rising. At today's @EnergyCommerce markup I spoke in support of HR 3932 the PASTEUR Act which would promote the development of new antibiotics. We need to make this investment now to save lives in the years to come.
