repdarrellissa,Is this a bad time to remind the media that Hillary's campaign manager just gave sworn testimony in federal court that she launched the Trump Russia hoax?
repdarrellissa,In August Biden said he'd respond militarily if China attacks Taiwan. His staff walked it back.In October he said it again. Walked back again.Today he said it a third time. Walked back a third time.Is Joe Biden really in charge?
repdarrellissa,Hillary’s campaign manager swears in court she was behind planting the Russia hoax in the media.Would have been good to know that any time in the last six years.
repdarrellissa,It shouldn’t take a federal judge to stop Biden from making his open border crisis from getting even worse.
repdarrellissa,Let's be clear: A primary reason we opposed Biden's disinformation board is because the person he wanted to run it has a history of spreading disinformation.
repdarrellissa,Imagine a government disinformation board so badly conceived and with a leader so poorly vetted that even this White House had to cancel it.
repdarrellissa,Just this month the Biden Administration has delivered a baby formula supply crisis 10 days in a row of record gas prices and the most illegal border crossings ever.If this was a boxing match they'd stop it.
repdarrellissa,I think Republicans got the better end of the deal swapping Steve Schmidt for Elon Musk.
repdarrellissa,The White House may have dropped the DHS Minister or Truth. The war on conservative free speech continues every day.
