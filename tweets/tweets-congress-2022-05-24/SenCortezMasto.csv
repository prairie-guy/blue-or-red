SenCortezMasto,I’m heartbroken. Paul and I are praying for the victims and their loved ones during this time of unimaginable pain. Children should be safe in this country. Everyone should be safe in this country. We must protect people from this senseless violence.
SenCortezMasto,I met with Amie Braik and Richard Scroggie Nevada teachers who received the 2020 and 2019 Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching the highest honor for K-12 educators in #STEM. Nevada has incredible teachers and I'll always work to support them. 
SenCortezMasto,Today I spoke with Nevadans from @aafp about my work to expand access to telehealth services across our state increase funding for mental health care and ensure Medicaid patients can always receive high-quality primary health care. 
SenCortezMasto,Data brokers are tracking and selling personal data of people who use family planning services like Planned Parenthood. I’ve always worked on privacy issues and now I’m pushing to make sure @FTC protects the privacy of all those seeking reproductive care.
SenCortezMasto,Nevadans! The Mammovan Mobile is at the Sierra Nevada Health Center in Carson City today until 3:40pm. Mammograms are the best way to find signs of breast cancer early. More info below:  
SenCortezMasto,Sky-high medical costs don't just hurt Nevadans' wallets. They force people to skip doses cut pills in half substitute over-the-counter drugs or stop treatment entirely. I've been fighting to lower medical costs for Nevadans and I won't stop until we do. Read more below. 
SenCortezMasto,Nevada’s small police departments work hard to protect our communities with limited resources compared to larger agencies. My bill would ensure all of our state’s law enforcement officers have the tools needed to keep Nevadans safe and I'll keep working to pass it into law. 
SenCortezMasto,Wildfire season is around the corner and @SenJackyRosen and I are working hard to ensure Nevada has every tool to help wildfire professionals prevent fires and quickly respond to those that spark. 
SenCortezMasto,Access to reproductive health care is under attack and data brokers shouldn’t be selling information that shows when Americans visit clinics. I joined my colleagues including @SenAmyKlobuchar and @SenatorBaldwin to continue my work with the @FTC to protect women’s data privacy.
SenCortezMasto,Last year was the worst on record for drug overdoses. I’m working to get Nevadans the treatment they need and I’m proud to announce $50000 I helped secure is headed to Las Vegas to increase access to mental health services and reduce substance abuse for our kids ages 12-18.
SenCortezMasto,The Senate has designated this week as National Police Week and I’m proud to honor and support Nevada's law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe. #PoliceWeek2022
SenCortezMasto,I joined @SenJackyRosen in introducing legislation to help federal science agencies improve wildfire preparedness by investing in cutting-edge technology and research and development. I’m always working to get Nevada every tool possible to protect our communities from wildfires.
SenCortezMasto,I’m thrilled the Smithsonian’s @USLatinoMuseum which I pushed Congress to create will open its first exhibit soon. Latino history is American history and I’ll keep working to ensure that the museum becomes a reality to honor our community’s immeasurable contributions. 
SenCortezMasto,We need to investigate and document the injustices of Indian Boarding School policies. I support legislation to do that and I’m calling on @IndianCommittee to hold a hearing on the topic.
SenCortezMasto,I voted to pass bipartisan legislation to protect our national security defend democracy and stand up to Vladimir Putin. We will not back down in the face of Russian aggression and will continue to hold Putin accountable for Russia’s illegal devastating invasion of Ukraine.
SenCortezMasto,Nevada’s small law enforcement agencies struggle to compete with larger ones for access to resources. My bipartisan Invest to Protect Act would make sure they have funding to recruit and train officers and I'm proud it passed @JudiciaryDems and is a step closer to becoming law.
SenCortezMasto,Las empresas tecnológicas pueden y deben hacer más para combatir la desinformación sin comprometer nuestra privacidad. Seguiré trabajando para proteger a nuestra comunidad contra la desinformación y fortalecer la confianza en la salud pública y la democracia. @ElSoldeNevada 
SenCortezMasto,It was a pleasure to speak with @RSIC_Tribe’s Chief of Police Mr. Michael B. Ford in today’s @IndianCommittee. We discussed the importance of hiring and retaining experienced Tribal law enforcement officers to keep Native communities safe and tackle critical issues like #MMIW.
SenCortezMasto,I’ve been a strong supporter of veterans and this legislation will help those exposed to burn pits and other toxins receive care they deserve. This bipartisan deal is a crucial step forward and I will proudly vote to pass this important bill into law. 
SenCortezMasto,Nevadans if you need help locating infant formula please visit the website below for ways to find the products you need. ⬇️ 
SenCortezMasto,Formula is harder to find in Las Vegas than in any other city in the country and that is unacceptable. @SenJackyRosen and I are pushing @US_FDA to do more to address this shortage and prevent it in the future. We’ll keep fighting to get Nevada families the resources they need. 
SenCortezMasto,Nevada is facing another summer of intense fire danger and I’m proud to deliver critical funding to help stop wildfires from spreading in our communities and prevent them before they spark. #WildfireAwarenessMonth
SenCortezMasto,My grandmother struggled to afford her medicine. She often had to choose between filling her prescriptions or buying groceries. Prescription costs shouldn't be this expensive. I'll keep fighting to lower prescription drug costs for all Nevadans. 
SenCortezMasto,I met with the @alzassociation to discuss funding I secured for Alzheimer's public health programs in Nevada. This is personal to me—I watched my grandmother struggle with this disease. I will always advocate for research to combat it. 
SenCortezMasto,Health care is one of the top issues I hear about when I speak with Nevada families. Tonight I'm joining @ForOurFutureNV to talk with Nevadans about the work I’m doing at the federal level to lower costs and increase access to quality health care in our state. RSVP below!
