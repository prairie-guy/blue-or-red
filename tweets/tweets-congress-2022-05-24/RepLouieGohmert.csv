RepLouieGohmert,Americans wait at airports for shipments of food so their babies can eat.Meanwhile Biden sends pallets of baby formula to illegal aliens at the border.It didn't even take two years for Biden to put the U.S. on track to be a third world country.#BidenBabyFormulaCrisis 
RepLouieGohmert,Any bill that is serious about combating #China cannot cede U.S. sovereignty to the UN. Despite being the largest donor country to the UN we've received very little to show for our heavy investment.@RepLaMalfa @RepDLamborn @RepGregSteube 
RepLouieGohmert,Punishment during pretrial confinement has repeatedly been held unconstitutional. But the Constituiton appears to be no bar to the Biden DOJ’s antagonism. #J6 @julie_kelly2 @DineshDSouza @McBrideLawNYC 
RepLouieGohmert,The Clinton campaign knew it wasn’t true. #RussiaHoax @newsmax @BobSellersTV @KatrinaSzish 
RepLouieGohmert,Can’t fill up your gas tank? Who caused that?The Biden Administration.Who caused the shortage of baby formula?The Biden Administration. #GohmertHour
RepLouieGohmert,6/6 My full statement on my vote against giving the FDA $28 million in light of the #BidenBabyFormulaCrisis 
RepLouieGohmert,5/6 The #FDA got us into this mess and they cannot get us out of it. Enabling Abbott to reopen its facility swiftly and removing burdensome government restrictions and regulations from safe baby formula from overseas would be a more efficient solution.” #BidenBabyFormulaCrisis
RepLouieGohmert,4/6 Creating a bigger deficit and increasing #Bidenflation while using even more money to create bigger more dysfunctional government is not a solution no matter how attractive that may sound to some in the media. #BidenBabyFormulaCrisis
RepLouieGohmert,3/6 POTUS &amp; his bureaucrats have done NOTHING for months to alleviate or mitigate the problem but now want to throw more money at their bureaucratic friends out of a desire to as Democrats have said before avoid letting 'a good crisis go to waste.’ #BidenBabyFormulaCrisis
RepLouieGohmert,2/6 There was no easing of restrictions by the #FDA no reopening plan from the FDA and not even an apparent awareness of the consequences of their actions until there was a critical shortage &amp; American mothers were unable to feed their babies. #BidenBabyFormulaCrisis
RepLouieGohmert,1/6 Giving #FDA millions won't produce one ounce of #babyformula. Getting the FDA out of the way would accomplish that new production. The shutdown and subsequent investigation of the  Abbott facility by the Biden FDA found no deadly bacteria in products. #BidenBabyFormulaCrisis
RepLouieGohmert,What an honor it was to meet WWII Marine Veteran and constituent Mr. James Lindsey today at the Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony. Thank you for your service! 
RepLouieGohmert,This morning @RepMTG and I delivered a letter to Mayor Bowser about the horrible treatment of #J6 detainees in the DC Jail. 
RepLouieGohmert,With @RepDLamborn and colleagues LIVE at the press conference on the Taylor Force Martyr Payment Prevention Act
