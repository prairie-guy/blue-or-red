RepChipRoy,Rep Roy is monitoring the situation and praying for the safety of all involved. 
RepChipRoy,"""The vote in Congress wasn't for or against support of Ukraine. It was for or against an unpaid-for unamendable take-it-or-leave-it $40 billion omnibus proposal cobbled together outside the committee process.""Bingo. @KevinRobertsTX"
RepChipRoy,“They're making a MOCKERY of our immigration laws.”“They want to make sure that they can allow ANYBODY into the United States REGARDLESS of consequence” Rep. Roy explains how the Biden Admin is causing CHAOS at our border: 
RepChipRoy,Skyrocketing diesel prices mean skyrocketing prices for EVERYTHING ELSE“That’s getting passed on to YOU…You the American people are gonna pay for that!”“Democrats in this body in the Senate and in this Administration wave it off laugh it off and say ‘go buy a Tesla’” 
RepChipRoy,Tapping a reserve meant to support home heating won't do a thing to reverse the impacts of Biden's war on working Americans. This reserve only contains 1 million barrels of diesel - the U.S. consumes about THREE TIMES THAT PER DAY.#EnergyFreedom
RepChipRoy,It's time to end the chaos.  Bottom line: MANDATORY turn away in the absence of FULL detention until the FINAL adjudication of an asylum claim (current federal law).More about #HR7772: 
RepChipRoy,"""It’s 'inflammatory' to describe an abortion as a dismembering activity. You’re supposed to hide it behind euphemistic lingo like 'abortion care'.” "
RepChipRoy,"“[House Republicans] are coming up to me and saying 'oh Chip you guys in the @freedomcaucus are daring to force votes on a bunch of bills and making us vote. We've missed eight fundraisers this week.' ...Oh I'm sorry. Did we interfere with your steak dinner?"" -Rep Roy "

RepChipRoy,We presented Schumer and Pelosi with MULTIPLE ideas that would unleash American energy WEEKS AGO.But they’d rather hold a vote on a bill that won’t do a damn thing than actually help the American people.END🧵
RepChipRoy,Liberal states like New York – which has banned fracking despite sitting on vast shale reserves – stand to win big under this bill.But Rep. Roy’s amendment to DEFUND states and cities that restrict fossil fuel production and fracking didn’t even receive a vote. 
RepChipRoy,U.S. energy production has been DECIMATED by Biden’s policies.Case in point – the U.S. produced 55 million FEWER barrels in February 2022 than it did in February 2020.This bill does NOTHING to address that fact. 
RepChipRoy,House Democrats rammed through a bill that empowers the federal government to impose socialist-style price controls on energy despite bipartisan opposition.But this bill DOESN’T DO A THING to undo the war President Biden and Democrats are still waging on American energy.🧵:
RepChipRoy,“It’s about empowerment of the federal bureaucracy to TARGET Americans!”Here’s the TRUTH about Dems’ “domestic terrorism” bill:

RepChipRoy,"""Do you know what kind of [EPA] rules we have coming out right now to HAMMER the coal industry in Texas and elsewhere? MASSIVE rules!”“Do you know what that means for the American people? NO energy LOWER energy HIGHER costs.”Rep Roy lays out the facts w/ @RepScottPerry "
RepChipRoy,"Gas prices hit a new high this week. Why?""It is precisely the policies of the administration to purposefully LIMIT the ability to produce oil and gas in this country.”“THAT is their agenda NOT the benefit of the American people."" "
RepChipRoy,"""We NEED to secure the border of the United States and enforce the policies including Title 42 and WHATEVER IT TAKES to secure the border.""Rep. Roy and @RepScottPerry condemn “crickets” from House Dems on border crisis: "
