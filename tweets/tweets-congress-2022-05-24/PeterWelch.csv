PeterWelch,Every day we make a choice about the kind of country we want to live in. This nightmare is not what any of us would choose. We must come together to take action.
PeterWelch,To my colleagues standing in the way of effective and comprehensive gun violence prevention: what is the purpose of government if not to keep its citizens – its children – safe?
PeterWelch,No one should have to experience the kind of loss or bear the kind of pain that the community of Uvalde is facing today. I am heartbroken and angry. This country’s refusal to take action to prevent gun violence condemns us to an endless cycle of these tragedies.
PeterWelch,The science is clear: it's time to take climate action off the backburner. For clean air and water safe temperatures and an economy that can thrive for generations we need to take action on climate change.
PeterWelch,What will it take for my Republican colleagues to understand the importance of common-sense gun control? It is a disgrace that young people in America have to live in fear of gun violence. Action is long long overdue. 
PeterWelch,Vermonters are facing high prices across the board. Working families need Congress to cut costs. I’m fighting to let Medicare to negotiate drug prices cut costs for families and stop Big Pharma’s rip off pricing. It’s a practical step to lower prices. Let’s get it done.
PeterWelch,This is a good step from Pres. Biden to address shortages.But we can't forget: corporate greed got us here. Three companies control most of the baby formula market. To make sure this never happens again we must take on corporate consolidation.

PeterWelch,Big Oil is price gouging at the pump and taking advantage of American families. Working families need help. I voted YES on the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act to get Big Oil to stop #RippingOffAmericans. 
PeterWelch,This week @POTUS announced that all households are eligible to receive 8 free at-home COVID tests. As more Vermonters return to in-person activities easy access to testing is more important than ever. To request a delivery for your household visit: 
PeterWelch,For too long Big Tech has been allowed to act without oversight or accountability. Their decisions impact our democracy our economy and our communities. That's why I drafted a bill to finally bring accountability to Big Tech. 
PeterWelch,With cleaner air the US could save thousands of lives and hundreds of thousands of dollars in healthcare costs.But we can only get there by reducing air pollution and moving away from fossil fuels. Let’s give ourselves a chance at a healthier future.
PeterWelch,The infant formula shortage is hitting close to home for Vermonters. I'm cosponsoring new legislation to fix supply chain disruptions so we can put more formula on shelves and make sure every family can access the formula they need.  
PeterWelch,Today @NatlHeadStart is celebrating their 57th anniversary. This program does such good work by providing essential services for low-income students and their families. I wish them a happy 57th birthday and many more years of service on behalf of working families.
