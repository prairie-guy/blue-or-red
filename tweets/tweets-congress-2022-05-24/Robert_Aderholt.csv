Robert_Aderholt,As I’ve said before relying on China and our adversaries for minerals critical to our industrial base is a ticking time bomb. We have to aggressively address this issue. 
Robert_Aderholt,I asked Administrator @SenBillNelson with @NASA about securing American research and development within the space industrial base. Evidently China didn’t like his answer. Its past time to expose China’s theft of American research and technology. 
Robert_Aderholt,Congratulations to @boeing for the successful launch of the Starliner capsule atop of the @ulalaunch Alabama built Atlas. A great step to a second option for getting astronauts to low Earth orbit. @BoeingSpace
Robert_Aderholt,I asked @SecRaimondo about our import reliance for critical minerals. “Vulnerable” is not a word that should be used to describe our standing with China on any issue. It’s time to work towards domestic production and trade with allies not adversaries.
