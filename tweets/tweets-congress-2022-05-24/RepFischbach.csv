RepFischbach,Biden declared war on American #energy from day one. Now experts are projecting gas prices will surpass $6/gal by August. We need to end the freeze on oil and gas leases fast-track pending LNG export permits and expedite all pipeline &amp; energy development approval NOW.
RepFischbach,I was glad to have the @NPPC come to my office to discuss a number of issues including foreign animal disease preparedness and response. 
RepFischbach,Families need answers and action now.
RepFischbach,I also voted for the Access to Baby Formula Act which would give the U.S. the ability to temporarily waive administrative requirements under WIC.
RepFischbach,Instead I co-sponsored the Babies Need Formula Now Act to use every avenue possible to import safe formula from abroad and lift barriers that restrict new types and brands from entering the market.
RepFischbach,Last week the Dems put out a bill that just threw money at the FDA and would do nothing to get formula back on shelves.
RepFischbach,This Admin owns America’s baby formula crisis. They knew we risked a shortage when they had to shut down a critical facility but did nothing to prevent it. Now stores are rationing formula and families are getting desperate. We need a solution to the baby formula shortage NOW.
RepFischbach,I had the rare opportunity to meet with Romanian Senator Laura Iuliana Scantei. Of course we talked about Russia's invasion of Ukraine &amp; concerns Romanians have should Russia succeed. It's always alarming to hear from people watching this happen in their own backyard. 
RepFischbach,Happy Armed Forces Day! America is grateful to all those courageously serving this country. 
RepFischbach,I had a great conversation with @BigIofMN – a group of over 725 MN insurance agencies – about so many important issues like the National Flood Insurance Program terrorism insurance crop insurance healthcare cyber security and insurance regulatory reform 
RepFischbach,Thanks to the Dee Foundry team for the tour! DEE Inc. is a metal fabricator in Crookston that specializes in making aluminum alloys custom aluminum castings and subassembly #MN07 
RepFischbach,FDA has grossly mismanaged this #formula crisis. While parents are scouring stores for their baby’s formula the Democrats’ solution is to write that same @US_FDA a $28 million check with no strings attached. 
RepFischbach,Thank you to @MNhospitals for coming by to discuss the healthcare workforce investing in rural broadband expanding access to telehealth services and your Hospital Financial Wellbeing Report 
RepFischbach,Democrats on the Judiciary Committee held a hearing in an attempt to pressure SCOTUS and influence their decision on Dobbs. Watch my comments here. 
RepFischbach,If you are one of the many people struggling to find formula HHS has compiled resources on their website. This crisis is unacceptable and the Administration must act quickly and decisively to help America's families  
RepFischbach,I recently went to @ArvigHQ for a tour and to talk about workforce issues inflation the business climate and broadband. Arvig is a MN-owned telecom company that’s been providing high-speed products and services since 1950. Thanks for having me! 
RepFischbach,I recently visited the Avian Flu Command Center in Willmar and the MN Poultry Testing Lab to tour the facilities and discuss the state’s management of HPAI. This is critical work as Minnesota’s poultry farmers continue to fight HPAI. Keep up the great work!
