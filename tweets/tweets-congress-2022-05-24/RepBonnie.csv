RepBonnie,Will republicans work with democrats to pass gun safety legislation now?How much is too much? 
RepBonnie,The United States has a gun violence epidemic ‚Äî a rate of killing not seen anywhere else outside a war zone. THAT'S the real embarrassment.Gun violence is a public health crisis. A national source of shame. 
RepBonnie,Today at least 2 children lost their lives to senseless gun violence.THIS WEEK there have been four mass shootings in the US. It‚Äôs only Tuesday. How much longer will we stand idly by and allow more needless bloodshed?I‚Äôm outraged. The Senate must pass gun control laws NOW. 
RepBonnie,Like so many other Trump-era immigration policies Title 42 was rooted in racism and cruelty. It lacks any moral justification and must end. 
RepBonnie,I'm still not over @SenBillCassidy's recent remarks about the Black maternal health crisis. Regardless of the Senator's intent his comments were unacceptable and emblematic of our country's normalization of white supremacy.Read my full statement:
RepBonnie,I was honored to welcome @SecFudge to Trenton today for the grand opening of Jennings Village a new affordable housing facility. This development was made possible thanks to a @HUDgov HOME grant. In a nation as wealthy as ours EVERYONE deserves safe affordable housing. 
RepBonnie,Every single one of my colleagues ‚Äî House and Senate Democratic and Republican ‚Äî has a moral duty to condemn white supremacy in all its forms. But simply disavowing this vile violent ideology should be the bare minimum. Dismantling systemic racism must be a priority. 
RepBonnie,Black lives matter. Black mothers matter. And I will not stop fighting until ALL of my colleagues ‚Äî House and Senate Democratic and Republican ‚Äî acknowledge that. (8/8)
RepBonnie,To call this hypocrisy unacceptable would be a gross understatement. I am saddened disgusted and appalled that a *sitting U.S. Senator* in the year 2022 can make this statement so nonchalantly. (7/8)
RepBonnie,A truly ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù Senator should have a vested interest in ending maternal health disparities. Instead Sen. Cassidy seems content to let Black mothers die as a result of pregnancies that his party would like to force them to carry. (6/8)
RepBonnie,It‚Äôs no surprise that a member of the party that scores political points by spewing conspiratorial ‚Äúgreat replacement‚Äù rhetoric and fomenting moral panics about so-called critical race theory in schools is perfectly comfortable ignoring the plight of Black American mothers. (5/8)
RepBonnie,GOP elected officials like Sen. Cassidy have no desire to dismantle these inequities ‚Äî it‚Äôs easier for them to ignore them. Because dismantling health inequities means acknowledging systemic racism and it‚Äôs against his best interests to do that. (4/8)
RepBonnie,Due to structural inequities built into our health care system. Black mothers are 3 times as likely to die due to complications from pregnancy than white mothers. In Louisiana that number jumps to 4. (3/8)
RepBonnie,I‚Äôll paraphrase the Senator‚Äôs statement. Sen. Cassidy is saying that his state‚Äôs maternal death rate wouldn‚Äôt be so high if you didn‚Äôt count Black women. He suggests that ‚Äúcorrecting‚Äù the data means eliminating Black maternal health outcomes entirely. (2/8)
RepBonnie,Regarding his state's high maternal death rate @SenBillCassidy says:‚ÄúIf you correct our population for race we‚Äôre not as much of an outlier as it‚Äôd otherwise appear.‚ÄùA third of Louisiana's population is Black. The Senator's statement is rooted in white supremacy. (1/8) 
RepBonnie,I‚Äôm proud to announce that I secured $405000 in federal funding to help renovate the @SBPublicLibrary!Libraries are gateways to discovery. This renovation will ensure that South Brunswick residents can enjoy everything their local library has to offer for generations to come. 
RepBonnie,Title 42 like so many other Trump-era immigration policies was rooted in racism and xenophobia. I thank @POTUS for his commitment to ending it.The federal court's decision to keep Title 42 in place is unacceptable and I commend the Administration for appealing this ruling.
RepBonnie,You can learn more about my Filer Voter Act here. (4/4)
RepBonnie,Potential voters should have as many opportunities as possible to register to vote so they can make their voices heard.By making voter registration more convenient my Filer Voter Act would strengthen our democracy during a time when democracy itself is under attack. (3/4)
RepBonnie,A year ago I introduced the Filer Voter Act. Based on the Motor Voter Act my bill would allow Americans to register to vote when they file their taxes. (2/4)
RepBonnie,#OTD in 1993 the Motor Voter Act became law. This legislation allowed Americans to register to vote when they apply for or renew a driver's license.In its first year this law helped 30 million Americans register to vote. (1/4)
RepBonnie,I proudly voted for legislation to hold oil companies accountable for their greed. Now it's time for a windfall profits tax. 
RepBonnie,Today I joined my @TheBlackCaucus colleagues in honoring the victims of the Buffalo shooting and denouncing white supremacy.From Fox News to the halls of Congress racist ideology has become far too normalized in our society. We as a nation must condemn it in all its forms. 
RepBonnie,If you're reading this you probably pay a higher tax rate than some of the richest people to ever exist.It's time to #TaxTheRich. RT if you agree. 
RepBonnie,After blaming President Biden for the baby formula shortage 192 Republicans voted AGAINST legislation to address the problem. That's the GOP playbook for you. 
RepBonnie,Abortion is health care. Pass it on. 
RepBonnie,Thank you @Ilhan for joining me in bringing some much-needed attention to this overlooked issue! It's an honor to fight race-based discrimination alongside you. 
RepBonnie,Pictured below is a tweet from a *sitting GOP Rep* spewing the same dangerous deadly rhetoric that motivated the Buffalo shooter.I don't care what party you belong to ‚Äî as a public servant condemning white supremacy should be the bare minimum. Promoting it is reprehensible. 
RepBonnie,"The operative word here is ""choice.""Americans have the constitutional right to *choose* whether or not they want to give birth. Let's keep it that way. "
RepBonnie,‚úãüèæ
