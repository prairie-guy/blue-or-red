RepChrisPappas,Took a tour and met the team at Brazonics in Hampton yesterday. This high-tech manufacturing is happening right here in the Granite State and we need more of it so we can out-compete the world. I’m negotiating legislation right now to help America and New Hampshire do just that. 
RepChrisPappas,If you're struggling to find the formula you need relief can’t come fast enough. That's why today I met with health care providers and community leaders from throughout the district to discuss how we can continue to address this shortage and help families as fast as possible. 
RepChrisPappas,Too many Granite Staters do not have access to clean drinking water which is why I fought hard to increase these grants to improve our water infrastructure and deliver funds for critical community projects across New Hampshire. 
RepChrisPappas,We have to do more to address the shortage of baby formula. Last week I voted to lower costs and deliver badly-needed relief to Granite State families. I’ll continue to do all that I can to address this pressing issue and improve access to formula. 
RepChrisPappas,As overdoses rise we need to see collaboration at all levels to take on this crisis and save lives. I remain committed to securing funds for prevention enforcement and treatment for individuals experiencing substance use disorder and their families.
RepChrisPappas,New Hampshire’s natural environment is one of our greatest treasures. I fought hard to pass the bipartisan infrastructure law to protect our environment and deliver vital funds like this. 
RepChrisPappas,Our veterans have already sacrificed so much for our country - they should not face undue barriers to accessing the benefits they have earned.Proud to co-sponsor and help pass this bipartisan bill that will make vital reforms to improve veterans health care. 
RepChrisPappas,COVID-19 exacerbated the affordable housing crisis in our state - disproportionately affecting low-income individuals and those suffering from addiction.Pleased to see these grants coming to our state at a critical time. 
RepChrisPappas,Stories like this are a heartbreaking and stark reminder of the need to crack down on drug trafficking across all fronts – including online. That’s why I introduced a bill to increase penalties for dark web traffickers and keep our communities safe.

RepChrisPappas,Each year I have the chance to nominate Granite State students to the service academies and it was great to talk more about these opportunities at our Service Academy Day. 
RepChrisPappas,We know there’s no silver bullet when it comes to solving the addiction crisis but one thing is clear: community-driven programs like ACERT and PET are working and paying huge dividends.I’ll keep fighting for continued federal investment in these and other efforts. 
RepChrisPappas,Great to join @ONDCP @SenatorShaheen and @DEAHQ earlier to talk about how local state and federal partners are working together to stop the substance misuse crisis. 
RepChrisPappas,Our law enforcement officials put their lives on the line every single day to serve us. Honored to be at the Law Enforcement Officers' Memorial to recognize those who have lost their lives in the line of duty. My thoughts are with their loved ones and families. 
RepChrisPappas,This funding will save lives. I’ll keep fighting to deliver critical funds and resources to our state to ensure first responders health providers and our loved ones have the tools they need to end the substance use disorder crisis.
RepChrisPappas,The horrific shooting in Buffalo serves as a stark reminder of the need to pass comprehensive reform to stop violent attacks like these. We must act to put an end to acts of domestic terrorism. 
RepChrisPappas,While Americans are paying more at the pump oil companies are reaping record profits. That's why I’m fighting to crack down on price-gouging and lower prices. We must use every resource available to bring down costs for families and small businesses. 
RepChrisPappas,An oil CEO recently called his company “a cash machine.” Four of the largest oil companies made $27 billion in profits in the 1st quarter of 2022. All while Granite Staters pay higher prices at the pump. My amendment will help stop price gouging and lower costs for NH families. 
RepChrisPappas,I just voted to pass legislation to increase access to formula and provide relief to families. We must do more to protect the health and well-being of America’s children and I’ll keep fighting so New Hampshire families can get the formula they need.
RepChrisPappas,Advancing this legislation is a victory for toxic-exposed veterans who have waited too long for us to uphold our promise to them. We're now one step closer to getting this done.
RepChrisPappas,We must do more to invest in and develop New Hampshire's workforce. That's why I voted to pass legislation that will help Granite State businesses fill current openings expand job training programs and spur economic growth across our state. 
RepChrisPappas,As a negotiator working to craft bipartisan manufacturing and competitiveness legislation I’m committed to being NH's voice in this process. I’ll fight for Granite State businesses and workers so that the future is made right here in New Hampshire.
