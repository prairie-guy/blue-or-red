SenRobPortman,Great to discuss the importance of expanding our trading relationship with #Japan and other countries in the Indo-Pacific region with @BloombergTV today. 
SenRobPortman,More on the surging drug epidemic in my op-ed for @DispatchAlerts: 
SenRobPortman,We can start by passing my CARA 3.0 FIGHT Fentanyl Act and TREATS legislation which expands our health care and justice system’s scope to ensure that all Americans fighting addiction have the chance to overcome this disease and those who sell synthetic opioids are punished.
SenRobPortman,Congress must double down the effort to address the risks of fentanyl being masked as prescription drugs and ensure those with addiction have access to the help they need. Together we can make our streets neighborhoods and communities safer from these synthetic opioids.
SenRobPortman,The synthetic opioid fentanyl is the main culprit including fentanyl in counterfeit pills. Because of COVID-19 the U.S. drug crisis is being fueled by the use and sale of these counterfeit prescription pills.
SenRobPortman,According to the latest data from the @CDC 107622 drug overdose deaths occurred in the U.S. last year the largest number ever recorded in a calendar year. In 2020 #Ohio reported more than 5200 deaths.
SenRobPortman,@CBP stats show fentanyl seizures at the border increased 48% in April 2022 compared w/ April 2021 &amp; increased more than 420% compared with April 2020. This admin must take action to control our southern border as both fentanyl seizures and illegal entries hit record levels.
SenRobPortman,The surge in illicit narcotics coming over our border continues to rise with seizures of heroin and fentanyl up more than 36% from March to April. 
SenRobPortman,Last April @sensherrodbrown and I introduced the Leveling the Playing Field 2.0 Act bipartisan legislation to strengthen U.S. trade remedy laws and ensure they remain effective tools to fight back against unfair trade practices and protect American workers.
SenRobPortman,I support of review of antidumping countervailing duty petitions from U.S. steel producers esp those facing challenges from unfairly traded steel from China India Italy Korea and Taiwan.
SenRobPortman,Last week I defended the Ohio steel industry during testimony before Intl Trade Commission.
SenRobPortman,I urge Congress to pass my CARA 3.0 FIGHT Fentanyl Act and TREATS legislation to ensure that those struggling with addiction have the resources they need.
SenRobPortman,#Ohio continues to face rising levels of opioid abuse overdoses and overdose deaths. The biggest culprit by far is the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl. This year #Ohio will report more than 5200 overdose deaths.
SenRobPortman,The Biden administration should abandon its plan to appeal this Title 42 ruling and instead focus on working with Republicans and Democrats alike to come up with a sensible plan to fix the crisis everyone acknowledges is unsustainable.
SenRobPortman,In addition to the continued surge of record number of unlawful migrants the @CBP stats also show the surge in illicit narcotics continues to rise with seizures of heroin and fentanyl up more than 36% from March. Two sad records: Record drug seizures and record overdose deaths.
SenRobPortman,The April @CBP operational stats showing record numbers of encounters on the southern border demonstrate why lifting title 42 would make a disastrous situation even worse. 
SenRobPortman,Glad to see DHS is now backing off this new disinformation body- at least for now. Foreign disinformation is already tackled through the State Department Global Engagement Center.
SenRobPortman,The proposed Dept of Homeland Security Disinformation Governance Board raises deep concerns. That’s why I joined several of my GOP colleagues in sending a letter to Senate Approps Committee urging all funding for the board be prohibited. 
SenRobPortman,With inflation showing no signs of slowing the Biden admin should lay out a plan to increase supply and provide relief for American families. The administration should work with Republicans on pro-growth policies to improve supply and get our economy moving again.
SenRobPortman,Inflation has reached a 40 year high gas prices have risen to record numbers for 12 straight days. This means demand is outstripping supply. The Fed is trying to reduce demand thru interest rate hikes. Best plan is to increase supply including energy supplies.
SenRobPortman,Best for American working families to increase supply.
SenRobPortman,Gas prices continue to hit record highs. As the price of gas continues to rise the Biden admin should expand American energy production to help provide relief for the American people. Energy inflation can be tamed either by reducing demand or increasing supply or both.
SenRobPortman,The House just passed the bipartisan State and Local Government Cybersecurity Act I wrote to strengthen the relationship between @DHSgov and state &amp; local partners to improve coordination and info sharing to help protect our IT infrastructure at all levels of government.
SenRobPortman,I’m glad to see the bipartisan legislation I wrote to ensure @USPS sells the ~41M remaining Saving Vanishing Species Stamps left in stock has now been signed into law. This will fund conservation through individuals buying the stamps. 
SenRobPortman,It is time for the administration to fix this problem by following the law and getting control of our southern border to ensure the safety and security of American families. I am ready to work on a bipartisan basis to find long-term solutions.
SenRobPortman,The alternative would have caused the situation at our southern border to go from a crisis to a catastrophe as April @CBP stats demonstrate with a surge not just of unlawful migrants but seizures of heroin and fentanyl.
SenRobPortman,I am pleased that the admin's desire to lift Title 42 was blocked today.
SenRobPortman,The Biden admin should be taking every opportunity to provide relief for American families as the U.S. economy begins contracting and a recession looms. 
SenRobPortman,The @BLS_gov announced that April was the 13th consecutive month of decreased wages. At a time when prices are up – wages are down and Americans are seeing their hours cut.
SenRobPortman,Ukrainians with close ties to the US should not feel that they need to make the dangerous approach at our southern border to make use of the admin’s failed border policies instead of using the Uniting for Ukraine program to temporarily come to the US. 
SenRobPortman,The @CBP stats for April reflect a fourfold increase in Ukrainians seeking asylum at our border. Ukrainians should be welcomed into our country as Russia continues its unjust aggression. It is concerning to me however that they are arriving at our southern border.
SenRobPortman,#GoBuckeyes 
SenRobPortman,I joined Sen. @SteveDaines &amp; other Republican colleagues in sending a letter to the Senate Approps Subcommittee on Homeland Security opposing the DHS Disinformation Governance Board &amp; urged that any $$ for it be prohibited in the FY2023 funding bill. 
SenRobPortman,Support for our ally Ukraine is critical to the national security of the United States and our allies around the globe. It sends a message to the world’s rogue dictators that America stands for freedom and with our allies in response to malign threats.
SenRobPortman,It also includes vital humanitarian aid that will help Ukraine as well as our allies address the unprecedented refugee crisis in Europe and stave off a global food crisis caused by Russia’s blockade of Ukraine
SenRobPortman,This package provides critical assistance for weapons and munitions to bolster the Ukrainian military’s efforts to stop and roll back Russia’s invasion.
SenRobPortman,I applaud Senate passage of this emergency funding request for Ukraine and am grateful it passed both chambers of Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support.
SenRobPortman,It was a pleasure to celebrate 200 years of U.S.-Colombian diplomatic relations with Ambassador Pinzón today. We discussed our efforts to help Venezuela return to democracy and economic prosperity and our shared support for #Ukraine in its fight for freedom. 
SenRobPortman,Yesterday I joined 51 colleagues in a letter urging the Biden admin to include Taiwan as a partner in the proposed framework. This would be an invaluable signal of America’s commitment to Taiwan. 
SenRobPortman,Last month I visited Taiwan as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation where we discussed the importance of Taiwan being included in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework as we signaled our support for Taiwan and its sovereignty.
SenRobPortman,As we return the Embassy to Kyiv it’s vitally important we have an ambassador there working with Ukrainian leaders and representing our American interests.
SenRobPortman,Pleased the Senate last night confirmed Bridget Brink to serve as U.S. ambassador to #Ukraine. She is well qualified for this important role.
SenRobPortman,I have expressed strong opposition to the DHS Disinformation Governance Board and urge that any funding for such a board be prohibited.
SenRobPortman,Enjoyed addressing the Ohio Space Forum hosted by @NASAglenn virtually today. #Ohio has a rich history of aviation &amp; aerospace achievements and I’m pleased that our Buckeye space &amp; defense leaders are coming together to ensure #Ohio remains a leader in the future of spaceflight.
SenRobPortman,Great to discuss the importance of supporting and expanding energy production in North America with @DavidAsmanfox today. 
SenRobPortman,Great to see that our @StateDept team from @USEmbassyKyiv has reestablished our diplomatic presence in #Ukraine. Thank you to the brave men and women from the @StateDept who represent us abroad.
SenRobPortman,It makes no sense to trade Russian oil for Chinese solar panels.
SenRobPortman,The administration should continue to defend American #jobs and not bend to pressure from the far left who are suggesting we throw our workers under the bus without a fair shake.
SenRobPortman,Pleased to see the Biden admin and @SecRaimondo investigate allegations of China’s unfair trade practices in the solar industry which harms U.S. manufacturing.
SenRobPortman,We must double down on our efforts to spread the word that fentanyl is deadly and help people struggling with addiction get the help they need. My CARA 3.0 legislation aims to expand prevention treatment and recovery in communities across the county. We must pass this bill now.
SenRobPortman,Lorain County #Ohio has reported 27 overdose deaths for May already. #Ohio has seen a terrifying rise in fentanyl being mixed with other drugs and even masked as prescription pills.
SenRobPortman,The April CBP numbers show 234088 total encounters at the border. If the Biden administration revokes the use of the Title 42 health policy next week our border crisis will become a catastrophe. 
SenRobPortman,The April @CBP operational stats make it clear that it would be irresponsible for the admin to follow through on its plan to lift Title 42 without putting policies in place to secure the border &amp; deter unlawful migrants &amp; illicit narcotics flooding our communities.
SenRobPortman,There is much more to be done and the U.S. and our allies must not let up in our support for #Ukraine at this critical time. 
SenRobPortman,I also spoke about the importance of voting to approve Finland and Sweden as @NATO members as swiftly as possible. It is imperative to illustrate that freedom-loving countries are not going to stand idly by and be intimidated.
SenRobPortman,The Senate should not adjourn until this supplemental package is passed and on its way to the president’s desk so we can give the Ukrainians the resources they need to win this war.
SenRobPortman,Tonight I spoke on the Senate floor for the 12th consecutive session week to discuss the brutal Russian invasion of #Ukraine. I am pleased that the supplemental funding bill ensures a smooth resumption of our diplomatic presence in the capital of Kyiv.
