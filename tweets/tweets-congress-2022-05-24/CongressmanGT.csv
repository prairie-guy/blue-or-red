CongressmanGT,Americans are coping with soaring inflation out-of-control food prices and skyrocketing energy costs. President Biden needs to stop his crusade on domestic energy production. 
CongressmanGT,Thanks to the Commonwealth Court PennDOT is finally being held accountable and required to follow the law. I hope this serves as a warning to those within the agency who think the public is not watching. 4/4
CongressmanGT,This preliminary injunction is welcomed news and will immediately stop all work related to the P3 Bridge Tolling Initiative. PennDOT has been executing contracts and entering into agreements which is dishonest and wrong. 3/4
CongressmanGT,PennDOT has acted unaccountable to stakeholders and legislators and has not conducted necessary studies associated with safety the environment traffic diversion local impacts and anticipated revenues. 2/4
CongressmanGT,PennDOT has blatantly ignored public opinion as it speeds forward with a tolling plan that will put yet another tax and burden on the traveling public. 1/4
CongressmanGT,For 57 years Head Start has given every child – regardless of circumstances at birth – a chance to succeed in school and in life. Happy birthday Head Start! #HappyBdayHeadStart
