RosaDeLauro,This impacts conductors engineers and transit service workers who deserve an increase in clean transportation and a reduction in air pollutants on the job. Modernizing transit builds our workforce allowing workers to transition to operating new clean energy fleets. 
RosaDeLauro,Investing in rail allows us to get where we need to go efficiently &amp; affordably all while reducing traffic pollution &amp; spurring our regional economy &amp; creating jobs.  As a person that takes the train between New Haven &amp; Washington I'm excited! … and running to my train. 
RosaDeLauro,In CT we celebrated the inaugural train ride of the M-8 Electric Train on @shorelineeast! This is a train that no longer relies on diesel fuel which makes this a big initiative for Connecticut when it comes to driving a clean air economy. 
RosaDeLauro,The climate crisis is here &amp; requires innovative solutions to guarantee a livable world. I'm proud @gathernewhaven has been selected to receive funding for their long-term mission of sustainability equity and environmental justice:
RosaDeLauro,My emergency supplemental appropriation bill will help get safe infant formula to families and I supported @RepJahanaHayes' Access to Baby Formula Act. I’m glad @POTUS heard our calls and launched Operation Fly Formula to import safe formula quickly. 
RosaDeLauro,The biggest message I heard from mothers today is that parents are scared.Parents are scrambling shelves and there simply is no formula to feed their babies. A mother said today her baby was on her last bottle of formula.Heartbreaking. 
RosaDeLauro,The infant formula shortage is hurting families in every pocket of the country.Today in New Haven I held a roundtable to talk with families about this issue and how the federal government is stepping up to help. We shouldn't have to choose between safety and supply. 
RosaDeLauro,This International Day to End Obstetric Fistula I’m proud to announce the reintroduction of the Physician Education for Fistula Treatment Act. This legislation will help us achieve the goal of ending fistula worldwide. 
RosaDeLauro,Families have been struggling to find infant formula &amp; when &amp; if they finally do they’re weighing whether it’s even safe to give to their babies. I’m glad @POTUS heard our calls &amp; launched Operation Fly Formula to get safe formula back on shelves. 
RosaDeLauro,I'm honored to receive a lifetime ban from Russia for my work to help defend the democracy of Ukraine. Putin my feelings aren't hurt. The collection of those banned for life from Russia come from all walks of life. I will always stand united with the people of Ukraine.
RosaDeLauro,This is alarming and families everywhere need to be informed. If you happen to have a jar included in the recall you should throw it away immediately. ⬇️
RosaDeLauro,Safe infant formula is on the way.Thank you @POTUS. 
RosaDeLauro,Acadia is back in the arms of her owner. Thanks everyone! 
RosaDeLauro,If you live in Washington D.C. please keep an eye out for this beloved member of Team DeLauro! Acadia is a sweet girl help us bring her home.  
RosaDeLauro,Last year I brought back Community Project Funding for the first time in 10 years because our communities have needs that the federal government must be responsive to. Robust investments are coming to Connecticut that will help families. 
RosaDeLauro,On @jaketapper I reiterated what I’ve said from the start — families across the country should not be struggling to feed their babies.In the short term we need to immediately boost supply. But we also have to look to long-term solutions to prevent this from happening again. 
RosaDeLauro,Tune in now ⬇️ 
RosaDeLauro,Our babies are vulnerable and parents are desperate.I'm not letting up on this issue until infant formula is back on shelves.
RosaDeLauro,The federal government has an important role to play in addressing this painful issue.I'm going to introduce legislation that will move us forward. We need a single food safety agency that focuses on keeping product on the market safe for consumption. 
RosaDeLauro,Oil companies’ price gouging and market manipulation has led to record high fuel prices at the pump.  Today @HouseDemocrats are holding Big Oil accountable by passing the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act. We will no longer allow big corporations to rig our economy. 
RosaDeLauro,Tune in at 10 AM:
RosaDeLauro,I encourage everyone to watch @AppropsDems’ hearing with the @US_FDA. There must be accountability for the contaminated formula found at an Abbott facility in Sturgis MI and FDA’s delay in investigating whistleblower claims alleging wrongdoing.We need answers.
RosaDeLauro,The average college senior who borrows now graduates with nearly $30K in student loan debt. Today at 6:30 PM ET I'm hosting a live tele-town hall to provide an update on how @HouseDemocrats are working to combat student loan debt.  Dial-In: 855-920-0553 
RosaDeLauro,Thank you @POTUS. I have called for the swift importation of safe infant formula from FDA-approved facilities overseas since the start of the crisis and the need to invoke the Defense Production Act. With Operation Fly Formula &amp; DPA we are answering the call to families. 
RosaDeLauro,Today we’ll move legislation that immediately addresses this shortage by getting product back on shelves and in the coming weeks I will prepare legislation that betters food safety and helps prevent this crisis from happening again.
RosaDeLauro,This shortage caused in large part by corporate greed consolidation and disgraceful lack of oversight is now causing parents to struggle to feed their babies. 
RosaDeLauro,.@DataProgress reports that 61% of voters support me and @SenWarren's Schedules That Work Act. Workers and their families deserve stability and security not schedules left to the whims of their employer. This is what workers want. We have to listen.
RosaDeLauro,I agree @SecretaryPete. 
RosaDeLauro,The infant formula shortage currently facing our country is unacceptable. No parent should ever have to wonder how they will feed their child. @HouseDemocrats &amp; @AppropsDems will lead the way to secure emergency funding that will help fix this shortage &amp; #FeedOurInfants. 
RosaDeLauro,It was an honor to have Greek Prime Minister @kmitsotakis address a Joint Session of Congress this morning to mark the Greek bicentennial. I look forward to our continued partnership with Greece.
