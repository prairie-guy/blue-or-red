RepDonBeyer,Gun violence is the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 25. 
RepDonBeyer,They say more guns make us safer as the mass shootings keep getting more frequent and the toll keeps getting bloodier. It is not rational to accept massacres at our grocery stores churches malls and theaters. How can they not do anything? These are our schools our children.
RepDonBeyer,A year after @POTUS signed bipartisan hate crime prevention legislation including my Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act good to see A.G. Garland and @TheJusticeDept take new action to confront hate. We must fight the white supremacist ideology that fuels violence and domestic terrorism. 
RepDonBeyer,It's good to hear that FDA is will consider approving Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for young children next month the delays in this process have been extremely frustrating to many of us but now we are hopefully on a path to authorization soon. 
RepDonBeyer,Still true: taxpayers shouldn't be forced to fund stadiums for super-rich sports team owners like Dan Snyder.  
RepDonBeyer,I have plenty of disagreements with Governor Youngkin but credit where credit is due: this is great to see and I hope we see more of it. 
RepDonBeyer,The laws being passed in states like Oklahoma and being proposed elsewhere are absolutely horrifying. This is real. 
RepDonBeyer,"Our letter to Administration officials including the Secretary of State and Congressional leaders led by @GerryConnolly: ""We... urge you to advance the NATO accession of Finland and Sweden as expeditiously as possible. Their membership would strengthen NATO deterrence of Russia"" "

RepDonBeyer,Congratulations to everyone involved in today’s celebration of the renovated Jennie Dean Park I was thrilled to participate and dedicate a field with many wonderful constituents! 
RepDonBeyer,A new Kremlin list of people banned from traveling to Russia just dropped; I am less interested than they might think in traveling to a country that is indiscriminately bombing Ukrainian civilians. 
RepDonBeyer,"“Beyer cosponsored legislation to reform the low-income housing credit. He praised the new housing initiative for how it would 'improve and expand financing options... support affordable housing construction and provid[e] government-owned housing to owners who will live in them'"" "

RepDonBeyer,I have long supported statehood for Puerto Rico and am thrilled to see this bipartisan agreement on a process that will help make statehood possible. Puerto Ricans deserve self determination. 
RepDonBeyer,Update for constituents who have been reporting issues with USPS recently: I met yesterday with the Arlington Postmaster to try to resolve these mail delays. I am told that additional staff have been hired to eliminate the back log and return to reliable service.

RepDonBeyer,Sweden and Finland didn't seek to join NATO until Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine which has been accompanied by overt threats from the Kremlin. Putin gave Sweden and Finland every reason to seek NATO membership and now that they have done so Congress will have their back.
RepDonBeyer,Sweden and Finland have significant military and intelligence capabilities much of which are already integrated with NATO partners.As co-Chair of the Friends of Sweden Caucus I've discussed a possible bid by Sweden and Finland to join NATO with colleagues during recent weeks.
RepDonBeyer,Sweden and Finland have strong bipartisan support in Congress as they seek NATO membership and their addition will meaningfully enhance the security of the whole alliance. Our resolution expresses the House of Representatives' approval for welcoming both countries to NATO: 
RepDonBeyer,It's part of a $5 billion program to upgrade our nation's school buses funded by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which I voted for last year. Less carbon pollution from school buses means healthier children and a healthier climate.

RepDonBeyer,As the horrific hate-fueled mass shooting in Buffalo shows we have more work to do and further implementation and funding of this law will help. I'm joining Attorney General Garland at the Justice Department to discuss new actions to combat hate crimes:
RepDonBeyer,One year ago the President signed bipartisan hate crime prevention legislation which included my Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act to strengthen law enforcement's response to hate crimes and support victims nationwide. It was an important moment of bipartisan progress to solve problems.

RepDonBeyer,These actions follow previously announced measures in Congress and the Administration to address the baby formula shortage. This has been hard on many families but we are working to solve it. 4/4
RepDonBeyer,Meanwhile the President announced new initiatives to get more formula into the United States and onto store shelves:
