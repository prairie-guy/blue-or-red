SenDuckworth,Every parent's nightmare. I‚Äôm heartbroken for these families and angry as hell at Republicans' shameless inaction to save the lives of innocent children.For every victim of this tragedy enough has to be enough. 
SenDuckworth,While @SenateDems stand up for women and reproductive freedom MAGA Republicans are scheming to take rights away from millions of Americans for the first time in our nation‚Äôs history. It‚Äôs unforgivable.
SenDuckworth,As a founding co-chair of the Senate‚Äôs first-ever @EJusticeCaucus I'm proud @POTUS‚Äôs admin has made environmental justice a real priority. This week will highlight historic EJ initiatives‚Äîfrom Justice40 to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law we're making progress at long last. 
SenDuckworth,This is the strong American leadership we need. @POTUS's Indo-Pacific Economic Framework will help strengthen our economy support Illinois farmers and ranchers and signal we'll work with our friends in the region to counter China's influence. 
SenDuckworth,I applaud @POTUS for swiftly signing into law the Access to Baby Formula Act which I helped introduce. This law will help ensure WIC can immediately respond to our nation's infant formula shortage so families don‚Äôt go without the food they need.
SenDuckworth,Working families shouldn't have to worry about affording the medicine or gas they need to get by.Insulin costs should be capped at $35/month.Big Oil shouldn't price gouge hardworking Americans at the pump.Democrats are working to make lower costs a reality.
SenDuckworth,Successfully leading the Delano Grape Strike in 1965 Larry Itliong helped empower California farm workers to protest against low wages poor working conditions and much more. May we continue to expand worker protections everywhere. #APAHM 
SenDuckworth,I don‚Äôt want my daughters to have to grow up in a country that won‚Äôt protect them from gun violence. I'm proud to re-introduce this legislation again with @RepBobbyRush to help prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.
SenDuckworth,The rain couldn‚Äôt stop us from celebrating all of the accomplishments of @HarperCollege‚Äôs graduates today. I was honored to deliver this year‚Äôs commencement address and I can‚Äôt wait to see the impact the Class of 2022 makes in their communities. 
SenDuckworth,Every day servicemembers put on the uniform of our nation to serve and defend our country‚Äîboth at home and across the globe.This Armed Forces Day and every day we owe them a debt of gratitude. 
SenDuckworth,It was an absolute pleasure to welcome @danieldaekim and other AANHPI activists to my office with @RepAndyKimNJ. Asian Americans are American‚Äîand it's up to all of us to speak out and bring about a tomorrow where everyone can achieve the American dream and live free of hate. 
SenDuckworth,üö®NEWS: Today my colleagues and I are calling on @USGAO to conduct a study into the persistent barriers that Americans with disabilities experience in accessing healthcare *despite* having strong protections to access and receive equitable care under the law. This is overdue. 
SenDuckworth,Heartbroken by this tragedy‚Äîa tragedy that happens far too often in our nation. But we don't have to live like this. We need Republicans to come to the table so we can pass what a wide majority of Americans agree we need: commonsense gun safety reforms.
SenDuckworth,One year ago I was proud to be at President Biden's side as he signed our COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law‚Äîbipartisan legislation to help stop the anti-Asian hate plaguing our nation and terrorizing the AANHPI community. But our work is far from over. We must do more. 
SenDuckworth,Last night the House took an important step in supporting families¬†like Officer Smith‚Äôs¬†by passing the bipartisan Public Safety Officer Support Act I‚Äôve been pushing for. Now it‚Äôs time for the Senate to get it over the finish line.
SenDuckworth,Every Senate Republican‚Äîthe majority of whom don't have uteruses themselves‚Äîvoted against protecting Roe v. Wade and your right to decide what happens to your own body.
SenDuckworth,Our National Guardsmen and women work to protect and defend our Constitution and respond to communities in times of crisis‚Äîwe should ensure they receive their earned promotion on time so their pay matches their job.Proud to introduce a bipartisan bill to do just that.
SenDuckworth,The resources I voted to pass today will help ensure Ukraine‚Äôs territorial sovereignty its people‚Äôs survival and their right to self-governance continues for generations to come.
SenDuckworth,The human suffering caused by Putin‚Äôs unjustified and unjustifiable attack on Ukraine‚Äôs sovereign territory demands our continued attention and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so proud the Senate passed this important bill to help the Ukrainian people today.
SenDuckworth,Making our nation's infant formula shortage a top priority is an important move by @POTUS. We must do everything we can to make sure there is enough formula available in our stores ASAP for families who depend on it‚Äîand make sure a shortage like this never happens again. 
SenDuckworth,Let‚Äôs be clear: nationwide infant formula shortages like the one we‚Äôre seeing now can have serious consequences on a child‚Äôs growth and development‚Äîand it‚Äôs unacceptable. Proud to help intro new legislation with @SenBobCasey and my colleagues to ensure this never happens again.
SenDuckworth,Enough with Republican hypocrisy. We need to protect Roe v. Wade and reproductive freedom NOW. 
SenDuckworth,NEWS: My bipartisan Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act passed out of @SenateSmallBiz to codify @SBAgov's Boots to Business program‚Äîproviding an opportunity for servicemembers and their spouses to develop entrepreneurship skills.
SenDuckworth,I‚Äôm proud to join my @SenateDems colleagues to reiterate that Democrats are not going to give up when it comes to protecting reproductive rights. No matter what.
SenDuckworth,That moment crystalized the power of America for me. Just the fact that our guys were taking orders from a woman‚Äîan Asian American woman‚Äîshows the power of America and our diversity.We're all American we respect each other and it‚Äôs important the rest of the world sees that.
SenDuckworth,"At the time I was the only woman officer in the unit‚Äîand the only Asian American in a command position.Someone asked one of my guys if they could look at our aircraft and he said ‚Äúyou gotta go talk to her.‚ÄùThey asked ‚Äúwho? The little Asian girl?‚Äù""Yeah she‚Äôs the boss.‚Äù"
SenDuckworth,For me the pivotal realization that the strength of our nation lies in our diversity happened when I was a young platoon leader and First Lieutenant participating in Operation Brightstar a NATO training exercise in Egypt.
SenDuckworth,Asian American Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander stories are American stories. We belong here. 
SenDuckworth,"Vincent Chin would have turned 67 today. But his life‚Äî and too many others‚Äîwere tragically cut short by anti-Asian hate. On this AAPI Day Against Bullying and Hate we must build on our work to end the cycle of violence against our fellow Americans.We are not the ""other."" "
SenDuckworth,This year's committee-passed WRDA will boost our economy protect public health and create jobs through investments in water infrastructure. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get this bill signed into law.  
SenDuckworth,Today marks the 68th anniversary of the Supreme Court's unanimous Brown v. Board decision to dismantle racial segregation in schools. It's one of the most important precedents in our legal system‚Äîand should always be treated as such.
