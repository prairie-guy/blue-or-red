BobbyScott,Since we passed @POTUS' Infrastructure Law the Biden Administration has:➡️Announced $110 billion+ to rebuild roads &amp; bridges modernize ports &amp; airports replace lead pipes &amp; expand high-speed internet➡️Funded 4300 projects across 3200+ communities
BobbyScott,This is why @POTUS invoking the Defense Production Act was so important. It is making the difference and speeding up production to get more infant formula on the shelves 
BobbyScott,.@POTUS signed my Access to Baby Formula Act so people can access the formula they need. Now by invoking the Defense Production Act the Biden Administration is also working aggressively to get infant formula back on the shelves. 
BobbyScott,I introduced the Access to Baby Formula Act with @RepJahanaHayes earlier this week. Very glad to see this legislation passed and signed into law. 
BobbyScott,Had a great time today at the @gotrhr Birthday 5K! 
BobbyScott,Great to be at @PortofVirginia today for the signing with Senator @MarkWarner @RepElaineLuria and @ShalandaYoung46. This is another example of how @POTUS Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a major win for Virginians. 
BobbyScott,Tomorrow at 10AM @RepMcEachin @RepElaineLuria and I will be hosting a Service Academy Day. Virginian students will hear more from our teams and representatives from the military academies. If you are interested in attending RSVP here:   
BobbyScott,Last night I attended @HamptonRoadsCAP’s 2022 Community Builder Awards. Good to be with @NNMayorPriceDDS @shelly_simonds @KevinGSwann @GayleneKan and honoree Dr. Janice Underwood. 
BobbyScott,The headline speaks for itself. Despite the obstruction Congressional Democrats and @POTUS remain focused on easing the baby formula shortage. 
BobbyScott,It is regrettable that none of my Republican colleagues supported this legislation. The MAGA Republicans constantly complain about high prices and inflation but they offer no plans to do anything about it.
BobbyScott,.@HouseDemocrats are focused on lowering costs for American families. The Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act will lower costs at the pump by putting an end to price gouging penalizing market manipulators &amp; bringing transparency to the secretive oil and gas market. 
BobbyScott,Enjoyed speaking with students from the Harvard Kennedy School this morning about Juvenile Justice Criminal Justice Reform and education policy. 
BobbyScott,The House has PASSED the Access to Baby Formula Act which I introduced with @RepJahanaHayes. This legislation ensures that 589000+ babies across the nation who rely on WIC benefits to purchase formula will  have improved access to additional formula products. 
BobbyScott,The formula shortage has disproportionately affected women &amp; children who rely on WIC benefits. The Access to Baby Formula Act will provide additional WIC flexibilities so vulnerable families can use their benefits on other safe &amp; available formula products. #FeedOurInfants 
BobbyScott,We currently have record low unemployment &amp; job growth yet job openings currently exceed applicants &amp; employers are clamoring for skilled workers. To help solve this problem I led passage of the bipartisan Workforce Innovation &amp; Opportunity Act of 2022
