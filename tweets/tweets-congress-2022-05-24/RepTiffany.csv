RepTiffany,Spending tens of billions of dollars in foreign aid month after month while American families struggle to pay their bills is not what I was sent to Congress to do.Thank you @RepHerrell for leading this effort and demanding accountability for the American taxpayers. 
RepTiffany,“Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”This sums up the Biden administration’s so-called “strategy” to lower the #BidenGasHike. 
RepTiffany,A great read from my good friend @RepPeteStauber.Instead of crippling our domestic mining industry and increasing our reliance on foreign countries like China for critical minerals we need to support Made-in-America mining here at home.
RepTiffany,A BIG win for energy affordability and reliability in Wisconsin and the Upper Midwest.#EnergyIndependence 
RepTiffany,"President Biden's ""incredible transition"" is only making life incredibly difficult for Americans every single day. It's time for the White House to end its senseless war on American energy and American families. "
RepTiffany,President Biden’s decision to rejoin the corrupt @WHO is concerning enough.Granting this international bureaucracy even more power is almost unthinkable.We must #DefundtheWHO!
RepTiffany,"The Biden-Pelosi ""solution"" to the baby formula shortage is to give FDA bureaucrats a $28 million raise?Blank checks for bureaucrats is not the formula needed to fix this crisis. "
RepTiffany,Americans cannot find baby formula.Americans cannot afford gas.Americans cannot safely walk on the streets in major cities.Welcome to another day in Joe Biden’s America!
RepTiffany,"Who knew George Orwell’s ""1984"" would become a how-to manual for the Biden administration?While freedom-loving Americans stood up and shut down Biden’s Orwellian Disinformation Governance Board we must make sure that nothing like this is ever created again. "
RepTiffany,Firebombings of pro-life groups &amp; intimidation of justices are all acceptable to the Democrats—despite having clear law that makes it a crime.Now abortion activists are calling for a summer of rage.Where is Biden's DOJ? Off targeting concerned parents. 
RepTiffany,This week I asked President Biden to visit #Taiwan and meet with President Tsai @iingwen during his trip to Asia. I sincerely hope he will consider doing so. America doesn't need a permission slip from #China to talk to our friends and partners.
