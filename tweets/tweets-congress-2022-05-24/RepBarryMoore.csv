RepBarryMoore,As a veteran and a small business owner I know our veterans' unique experiences &amp; skillsets often dovetail perfectly with the demands and opportunities of being a franchisee. I'm proud to introduce a resolution with @RepMikeLevin to honor the 30th anniversary of @VetFranIFA. 
RepBarryMoore,Today the national average is $4.598. While the American people battle crippling prices at the gas pump we have a president waging war on American energy.Thanks Joe Biden.
RepBarryMoore,This is happening at our southern border every single day. Our border patrol agents are working overtime to protect our border but illegal immigrants will stop at nothing to cross the border illegally and come into our communities. 
RepBarryMoore,Great news! This decision is a victory for the safety and well-being of the American people but also a sobering reminder of the dangers we face from an America Last administration. 
RepBarryMoore,If Pelosi can use the pandemic to justify continued proxy voting we can use it to keep Title 42 in place.
RepBarryMoore,Fake news organizations terrorists &amp; dictators are allowed a platform on Twitter so why is Project Veritas banned?@elonmusk can we do something about that?
RepBarryMoore,I agree Coach! With Americans suffering so terribly from inflation we shouldn't flood our overheated economy with billions of dollars in spending that lacks sufficient oversight mechanisms. 
RepBarryMoore,I firmly believe that there are two genders. Male and Female. The radical left doesn't. I joined my GOP colleagues to introduce the Women's Bill of Rights to reaffirm legal protection for women. 
RepBarryMoore,I think Biden just found his next Minister of Truth! 
RepBarryMoore,Under President Biden drug smugglers and drug cartels have exploited our southern border to bring drugs into our country killing dozens every single day. This is extremely alarming. We need to secure our southern border. 
RepBarryMoore,"Biden's Ministry of Truth is his most outrageous attempt to crush free speech.But the American people don't want to be silenced and fought back and now the Biden admin appears to be ""pausing"" their effort.This is why we fight. Don't let them silence you! "
