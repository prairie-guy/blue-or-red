RepBoebert,Today at 5:12pm the Forest Service sent me an email saying they are pausing all prescribed fire operations for 90 days. This bureaucratic decision will only result in more catastrophic wildfires as more fuel will stay on the ground. Chief Moore will be hearing from me about this! 
RepBoebert,The China-controlled WHO should have 0 control over America. They covered up the COVID pandemic lied for China and were the number 1 purveyor of disinformation during the early days of the pandemic. Let’s put America first for a change! 
RepBoebert,Rest In Pieces 
RepBoebert,The FDA caused the baby formula shortage by unfairly closing the Abbott plant based on charges proven untrue.Now Pelosi wants to give the FDA a $28 million raise!Democrats should be ashamed for pushing messaging bills &amp; not real solutions. End the games and feed the babies!
RepBoebert,"Giving the FDA $28 million more for bureaucrats' salaries won't solve the baby formula crisis the Biden regime created. I joined 192 Republicans in voting no on the Democrats' fake ""solution"" to spend millions of your tax dollars without getting more formula on the shelves."
RepBoebert,Prayer is powerful. Join me in praying for our Supreme Court Justices. 
RepBoebert,Today is a great day for free speech!  The Disinformation Board is effectively dead and Scary Poppins is out of work and won’t be able to censor conservatives as the Biden regime’s Minister of Truth.  Grateful to all that contributed to this victory.
RepBoebert,Don't rely on the Fake News! Read about my work to protect free speech honor our veterans back the blue and defend Colorado's rural communities in this week's newsletter. 
RepBoebert,Today is a great day for free speech.For Nina Jankowicz…not so much.
