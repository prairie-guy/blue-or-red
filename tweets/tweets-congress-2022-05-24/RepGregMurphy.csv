RepGregMurphy,Washington liberals are openly fueling a national gun registry. This is an unacceptable violation of our constitutional right to keep and bear arms. We must protect #2A. 
RepGregMurphy,Bidenâ€™s #BabyFormulaCrisis has created a third world problem in a first world country.
RepGregMurphy,The Biden Administration is tone-deaf to the needs of the American people. 
RepGregMurphy,ðŸš¨ Iâ€™ll be joining @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness at 9:15am ET to discuss President Bidenâ€™s baby formula shortage and his latest gaffe regarding #Taiwan. Tune in!
RepGregMurphy,Hillary Clinton @HillaryClinton is a crook and should go to prison for her deceit. 
RepGregMurphy,Happy #ArmedForcesDay! Today we honor and celebrate all those who have bravely answered the call to serve. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸#MilitaryAppreciationMonth 
RepGregMurphy,Excellent news. Trump-appointed federal judge blocks Biden from ending Title 42 â€” one of the last remaining lines of defense at our border. 
RepGregMurphy,So I spent the last couple days looking back through all my medical school books and all my journals. The verdict is inâ€¦Men cannot become pregnantâ€¦Itâ€™s called SCIENCE #EggPlusSpermEqualsBaby
RepGregMurphy,Great to visit @nature_org preserve at Nags Head Woods â€” one of the largest maritime forests on the East Coast! During our hike we discussed waterway management and preservation efforts in OBX Pamlico and Roanoke River. Thank you to Will Robinson for hosting us! 
RepGregMurphy,Bidenâ€™s self-inflicted disasters are causing approval ratings to plummetâ€” especially among Democrats. Only 33% of Democrats say our country is on the right track (down from 49% last month). 
RepGregMurphy,Iâ€™m joining @DavidAsmanfox on @FoxBusiness at 1:39pm ET to discuss the #BabyFormulaCrisis and Bidenâ€™s decision to invoke the Defense Production Act. Tune in! ðŸ“º
RepGregMurphy,Amazing that far-Left Socialists are blaming capitalism for the #BabyFormulaShortage. At this point maybe @PressSec will take a page from the #Bidenflation playbook and say the shortage is transitory? a good thing? Putin's fault? The American people see right through it.
RepGregMurphy,Let's be clear: the #BabyFormulaShortage is just the latest example of the Biden Administration's systematic failure to lead. @HouseGOP called for action months ago and as usual this Administration is dazed and confused. American families are suffering as a result.
RepGregMurphy,ðŸš¨ Biden is overseeing the 9th STRAIGHT day of all-time record gas prices. Families and job creators in my district cannot afford the #BidenGasHike ðŸš¨ 
RepGregMurphy,A win for free speech!
