SenAmyKlobuchar,With voting already underway we’ve heard of many challenges facing election administrators. Thank you to @RoyBlunt for joining me to hold a Rules Committee hearing on what we can do to support election officials working on the frontlines of our democracy. 
SenAmyKlobuchar,Competition. Innovation. This is what’s at stake if we don’t pass my bipartisan bill with @ChuckGrassley to stop Big Tech companies from preferencing their own products and services. It passed Committee. Now it’s time for the Senate to get it done.
SenAmyKlobuchar,Grateful to local officials from Swift Stevens Todd Polk &amp; Koochiching Counties who joined me to share how storms &amp; the cold wet spring weather have impacted their communities. As we work to rebuild and recover I'll be with you every step of the way.
SenAmyKlobuchar,Our state is so beautiful 🌻🌹🥀🌷🌼 
SenAmyKlobuchar,It’s simple: just because Big Tech companies are “Big” doesn’t mean they shouldn’t have to play fair with small businesses and entrepreneurs. We must pass my bipartisan legislation to put common sense rules of the road in place for digital platforms.
SenAmyKlobuchar,Thanks to my next door neighbor  @SenatorBaldwin for standing up for privacy 
SenAmyKlobuchar,This week the women senators joined forces with Admiral Linda Fagan the first woman to lead the @USCG and any U.S. military branch! 
SenAmyKlobuchar,Paula referred to herself as a ‘pragmatic optimist’ with a plaque in her room reading ‘nothing is impossible!’ It is that spirit that she brought to her work to her friendships and of course to her loving family. She will be deeply missed.
