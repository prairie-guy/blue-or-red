MichaelCBurgess,This is heartbreaking news. Praying for the Robb Elementary School students teachers and families along with wisdom for local police doctors and nurses.
MichaelCBurgess,#ICMYI I joined @FoxandFriends about the upcoming @HouseCommerce #BabyFormula hearing. I mentioned that you did not have to be a mind reader to see this crisis coming.   More here ⬇️ 
MichaelCBurgess,In #TX26 we have watched gas rise over $1 since the beginning of February when it was $3.39 per gallon. This week we saw prices at $4.47 per gallon. It is time to end the #BidenGasHike. 
MichaelCBurgess,Once again @WHO bows to China and excludes Taiwan from the annual World Health Assembly.While China worked against the world during the #COVID19 pandemic the world knew #TaiwanCanHelp.
MichaelCBurgess,President Biden - it's time for a trip down south.When will the President stop ignoring the #BidenBorderCrisis? 
MichaelCBurgess,After the @WHO so mishandled the #COVID19 outbreak in Wuhan President Trump wisely took us out of the WHO. Since President Biden foolishly put us back in there need to be reforms to hold bad actors such as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) accountable.
MichaelCBurgess,Title 42 is the last barrier keeping the southern border from complete chaos. #BidenBorderCrisis 
MichaelCBurgess,Picture of history or picture of the future? This is what America will look like if Dems succeed with establishing price controls. #FlipTheSwitch #BidenGasHike #ThrowbackThursday 
MichaelCBurgess,When will this admin wake up to the #BidenBorderCrisis?Just last month over 221K migrants attempted to enter this country illegally not including got-aways.Thank you @RepTroyNehls for leading the effort to once again try &amp; hold this admin accountable for their failed policies. 
MichaelCBurgess,Instead of accepting the reality of the energy crisis Americans are facing at the pump Dems are once again attempting to shift the blame and trying to implement socialist price controls on gasoline. #FlipTheSwitch #BidenGasHike More here: 
MichaelCBurgess,What is the @US_FDA trying to hide? 
MichaelCBurgess,May is #MotorcycleSafetyAwareness month. My passion for motorcycles began in college. #ThrowbackThursday 
MichaelCBurgess,Bureaucracies don't heal the sick and apparently can't put baby formula back on the shelves.
MichaelCBurgess,TODAY I sent a letter to @SpeakerPelosi @GOPLeader @rosadelauro @RepKayGranger @RepGregoryMeeks &amp; @RepMcCaul asking for a detailed briefing on the next steps for U.S. support to #Ukraine.This sudden &amp; significant spending must be backed up by an informed plan for success. 
MichaelCBurgess,I agree with @ColinAllredTX - “We have seen this model can succeed with the Defense Department’s similar agency so let’s put North Texas’ best and brightest minds in biotech research to work solving our health care problems.”
MichaelCBurgess,For the implementation of ARPA-H to be thoughtful and intentional it must be located outside of Washington D.C. North Texas is ready. @RepColinAllred and @RepVeasey lets work together to get this done. 
MichaelCBurgess,"B/c Americans called BS on the @DHSgov Disinformation Governance Board the Biden Admin decided to ""pause"" it.Maybe the Admin should also listen to the American people and take steps to end #Bidenflation the #BidenBorderCrisis and the #BidenGasHike."
MichaelCBurgess,"March 1 2022: @POTUS - ""We are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs."" May 18 2022: Biden Admin announces it will ease energy sanctions on Venezuela.What happened to buy American Mr. President? #FlipTheSwitch #BidenGasCrisis #bidenpricehike"
MichaelCBurgess,Here is an idea for @POTUS - ease the restrictions that you put on AMERICAN energy producers. #FlipTheSwitch
MichaelCBurgess,When it came to re-opening schools there should have been a rejection of one-size-fits-all solutions and a focus on ensuring that each student is able to receive the education that best fits his or hers personal needs.
