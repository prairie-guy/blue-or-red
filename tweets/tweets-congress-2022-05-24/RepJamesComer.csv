RepJamesComer,There is now a growing wave of violence perpetrated by radical far left extremists seeking to intimidate and influence Supreme Court Justices at their own homes.The Biden Administration has refused to condemn this behavior. @GOPoversight is taking action. @FoxFriendsFirst 
RepJamesComer,The Biden admin is still trying to force you to wear masks on planes but they’re apparently fine with potentially COVID-positive illegal immigrants coming to the U.S.Make no mistake ending Title 42 will turn the #BidenBorderCrisis into a catastrophe. @FoxFriendsFirst 
RepJamesComer,"The job of DHS is to defend the homeland - not censor criticism of Biden's Border Crisis!The last thing we needed was Biden's ""Disinformation Governance Board"" to cover up the truth. @MorningsMaria "
RepJamesComer,Maybe now Biden’s DHS will have time to do their job and…SECURE THE BORDER?!
