RepScottPerry,Heartbroken and sickened I send my strongest prayers and love to the families and loved ones of Uvalde Texas. This pure evil has no place in America  — or the world for that matter. We ask God for strength grace healing and justice.
RepScottPerry,421 days since @POTUS made absentee VP Harris Border Czar — maybe a good time to share those “root causes” as 234000 illegal migrants tried crossing our border in April a new record. Crickets from the one-party rule crowd. #BidenBorderCrisis
RepScottPerry,We MUST secure our border.
