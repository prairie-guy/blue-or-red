RepKatiePorter,Robb Elementary students went to school today ready to laugh with friends exchange ideas and learn. Fourteen aren‚Äôt ever coming home.These deaths come days after shootings in Buffalo Houston and here in Orange County. Another day is too long to wait to reduce gun violence.
RepKatiePorter,Americans lost ~$5.8 billion to fraudsters last year. With scams against seniors on the rise it's critical people know how to protect themselves and their loved ones. This Wednesday I'm going live with experts from @FTC and @AARP to discuss how older Americans can stay safe ‚¨áÔ∏è 
RepKatiePorter,Our entire economy will suffer if Americans aren't free to decide for themselves if and when to become parents. Women contribute trillions to our economy and many could be forced to forgo promotions cut their educations short or leave the workforce if Roe is overturned. 
RepKatiePorter,Antitrust enforcement has been plummeting for years enabling corporations to gobble up competitors and raise prices on families far beyond the inflation rate. I testified before @HouseBudgetDems and stressed the need to give @TheJusticeDept resources to crack down on monopolies. 
RepKatiePorter,A medical innovation is only a miracle if it reaches patients in need‚Äîand right now we are chronically underfunding medical studies in AAPI communities. I'm urging my colleagues to follow @UCIrvine's lead and invest in representation that could save lives. #AAPIHeritageMonth 
RepKatiePorter,ü•© 4 companies control 85% of the beef marketü´ò 4 companies control 80% of the soy marketüçù 3 companies control 78% of the pasta marketü•£ 3 companies control 72% of the cereal marketThese companies hike prices with impunity‚Äîespecially in uncertain times. We need competition.
RepKatiePorter,Families are suffering the consequences of market consolidation right now. Food monopolies are price gouging at the grocery store while a supply chain issue is limiting the amount of baby formula‚Äî90% of which is produced by 4 companies. We need more competition in our economy. 
RepKatiePorter,Oil and gas executives are publicly admitting to price gouging families at the pump. They've announced they're going to use their record profits to buy back stocks‚ÄîAKA pad Wall Street's pockets.
RepKatiePorter,ICYMI: The House passed my bill to lower gas prices by cracking down on Big Oil's price gouging. While families struggle to afford fuel the industry is reaping record profits and CEOs are bragging about keeping supply low so gas prices stay high. There must be accountability. 
RepKatiePorter,That's me with the gavel! (And that's my bill üòá) 
RepKatiePorter,Our bill the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act would lower gas prices by making predatory price hikes unlawful holding market manipulators accountable and boosting transparency in the market.The House passed my bill. Families need the Senate to do the same. (7/7)
RepKatiePorter,The oil gas industry shows why capitalism needs guardrails to work: Big Oil is purposefully limiting supply of an essential good to enrich shareholders.Today the House took action and approved my and @RepKimSchrier's bill to crack down on this price gouging. (6/7)
RepKatiePorter,REMINDER: Big Oil is sitting on 9000 unused drilling permits on ~14 million acres of public land. I confronted the CEOs of @bp_plc @exxonmobil @Shell and @Chevron about this hoarding. They all said they still want more taxpayer-owned land. (5/7)
RepKatiePorter,"The CEO of @exxonmobil touted on a recent earnings call that their goal ""is less about volume and volume targets [supply] and more about the quality and profitability of the barrels."" The scheme is working: the oil giant doubled its quarterly profits from a year earlier. (4/7)"
RepKatiePorter,"We have quantitative and qualitative data documenting Big Oil's price gouging. The CEO of @PXDtweets which has pledged not to raise production despite sky high prices bragged that ""whether it's $150 oil $200 oil or $100 oil we're not going to change our growth plans."" (3/7)"
RepKatiePorter,A majority of surveyed executives admit to not increasing supply because Wall Street doesn't want them to. Profits are at a 7 year high and shareholders don't want to give that up‚Äîespecially since Big Oil is planning $40 billion in stock buybacks. (2/7)
RepKatiePorter,Price gouging is anti-capitalist. Big Oil is threatening our entire economy by keeping supply low and jacking up prices at the pump far beyond the inflation rate to satisfy Wall Street.Oil and gas company executives are *literally* admitting it. (THREAD ‚¨áÔ∏è) 
RepKatiePorter,Big Oil is publicly bragging about keeping supply low to juice profits. This textbook price gouging is hurting families and threatening our entire economy. I'm grateful the House will consider my and @RepKimSchrier's bill to hold Big Oil accountable today.
RepKatiePorter,Too many communities including ours in Orange County know the pain of gun violence. It's unacceptable that online gun marketplaces can freely sell weapons to criminals. Today @RepJasonCrow and I introduced a bill to close the loophole that lets retailers escape accountability.
RepKatiePorter,Quid pro quo is the clearest form of corruption there is. Officials shouldn't be let off the hook just because they've left office.
RepKatiePorter,U.S. Fish and Wildlife refused to allow construction near an endangered river‚Äîuntil the Trump Administration intervened following $241600 in campaign donations from a developer and his friends.Led by @RepRaulGrijalva and me @NRDems has made a criminal referral for bribery. 
RepKatiePorter,Dr. John Cheng undoubtedly saved lives when he charged a shooter at his mother's church this past Sunday. Today I joined my Orange County colleagues for a moment of silence on the House floor to honor Dr. Cheng's life legacy and sacrifice. 
RepKatiePorter,Our country is confronting an opioid epidemic a gun violence epidemic and a humanitarian crisis at our southern border‚Äîall at the same time. I'm urging @HouseBudgetDems to provide our law enforcement agencies and key organizations with the tools they need to keep people safe.
