SenatorCarper,As a father I'm heartbroken. As a Senator I'm sickened by our inaction.How many more kids have to be murdered how many elementary schools attacked before we act? It doesn't have to be this way. We must act. 
SenatorCarper,Prioritizing environmental justice means providing all communities with a seat at the table. It's clear that @POTUS and his administration are committed to engaging with stakeholders as part of #Justice40 — something I appreciate as a co-chair of @EJusticeCaucus. 
SenatorCarper,RIGHT NOW: I'm on the Senate floor talking about the threat of harmful solar tariffs that would impede our ability to combat the climate crisis.TUNE IN⤵️ 
SenatorCarper,About a year ago @JohnCornyn and I argued that in order to have a shot at writing the rules of global trade you must have a seat at the table. I applaud @POTUS for launching the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework today which puts the US back in action.
SenatorCarper,Giving blood saves lives especially in Delaware where we need donors. Thank you to the fantastic @delmarvablood team and all those who make a difference by donating. 
SenatorCarper,Welcome @AFThunderbirds and @BlueAngels to Dover AFB! As a former Navy captain I couldn’t think of a better way to celebrate #ArmedForcesDay yesterday than at #ThunderOverDover2022 
SenatorCarper,During Asian Pacific American Heritage Month we celebrate the strength resilience and culture of our Asian American communities and the contributions they’ve made in our pursuit of a more perfect union. #APAHM 
SenatorCarper,Cleaner air and healthier students. These are investments worth making. 
SenatorCarper,This Endangered Species Day I’m thankful for @POTUS signing my bill with @senrobportman into law to sell all remaining @USPS conservation stamps. By buying one you can help protect at risk animals! 
SenatorCarper,It was great to join @christianacare to see a demonstration showing how my Hospital at Home Bill is working to bring care into homes across America. We should do all we can to expand access to care for more Americans—even after this pandemic is in our rearview mirror.  
SenatorCarper,This is a huge moment — earned by every @USWNT player who fought on and off the field for their right for #EqualPay.For years I joined @SenateDems in calling to right this wrong. I couldn't be more proud of what @USWNT has accomplished. 
SenatorCarper,From empty store shelves to shipping delays Americans are feeling the effects of supply chain disruptions daily.That's why @JohnCornyn and I are holding a hearing Wednesday in the @SenateFinance Trade Subcommittee to examine how we can make our supply chain more resilient.
SenatorCarper,This National Police Week we honor all who serve to protect our communities and remember those who've fallen in the line of duty. We must also give them the resources to build trust in our communities from body worn cameras to community mental health support. 
SenatorCarper,A jumpstart on education means a jumpstart on more life changing opportunities. And for 57 years the Head Start program has given millions of children in Delaware and across the country the help they need to prepare for elementary school and beyond. #HappyBDayHeadStart!
SenatorCarper,Millions of parents are scrambling to find infant formula after a nationwide shortage emptied shelves across America—including right here in Delaware. I joined @PattyMurray in writing a letter urging suppliers to increase production and get formula back out to parents ASAP. 
SenatorCarper,Congratulations to Delaware’s newest Presidential Scholars! We’re so proud of all your hard work. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for these five stand outs from the First State!
