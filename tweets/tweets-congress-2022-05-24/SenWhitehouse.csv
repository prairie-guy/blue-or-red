SenWhitehouse,Those who stand against progress on common-sense gun protections should take stock.  We must do something.
SenWhitehouse,We are all too familiar with this kind of tragedy in America. Uvalde joins a long list of American communities torn apart by gun violence in our schools. The slaughter of our students happens with grim regularity and it is met with equally grim inaction here in Congress.
SenWhitehouse,Today we sustained another mass murder of innocent children. My heart breaks for the families of those killed and for the community of Uvalde. I wish them comfort.
SenWhitehouse,It makes one wonder why we let corporations have such a dominant role in our politics.Their climate behavior is showing corporations to be unprincipled and untrustworthy a menace not a friend in dealing with climate change.
SenWhitehouse,I was just in Davos hearing lots of corporate happy talk on climate and trying to explain the actual political effort from corporate America in Congress.  Basically it’s the disinterested the opposed and the rabidly opposed which sums to huge negative pressure.
SenWhitehouse,Add up the lobbying the election spending and the trade associations and you have huge anti-climate pressure in Congress from corporate America — led by the @USChamber but it’s only one of a hundred negative corporate forces.
SenWhitehouse,Behind climate change inaction in Congress is climate change obstruction by corporate America. 
SenWhitehouse,A corporate climate pledge means nothing – absolutely nothing – if the company is still giving money to @USChamber. Their anti-climate lobbying has ost us precious years and brings us closer to disaster. 
SenWhitehouse,Thank you Rolling Stone and @Jaymichaelson for digging into what dark money did to our court system. Infuriating. Unpatriotic. Corrupt.
SenWhitehouse,Or you could consider DOING SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE for God’s sake!
SenWhitehouse,Last week we strengthened the enforcement tools the U.S. govt. uses to go after dirty money &amp; hunt down the international criminals who prop up Putin. We’ll keep making it harder for oligarchs to support Russia – nobody is getting off the hook for the invasion of Ukraine.
SenWhitehouse,Met with NATO military &amp; civilian leadership last week to discuss freedom for Ukraine. Every day the Ukrainian people fight bravely; our support must match their courage. 
SenWhitehouse,There are few individuals who’ve made a bigger difference in the lives of Rhode Islanders than @NeilDSteinberg. Under Neil’s energetic and thoughtful leadership @RIFoundation has stepped up as a force for good every time the state needed it. We are grateful. He’s been a friend.
SenWhitehouse,Read the rest here – more to do but this part is moving in the right direction.
SenWhitehouse,Here’s some good news - the Biden administration’s Justice40 Initiative is making progress. That means: - Replacing polluting diesel school buses - Creating public transit hubs - Removing barriers to employment in the green workforce
SenWhitehouse,Meanwhile it is actually SNOWING IN BRAZIL.
SenWhitehouse,Nothing going on here. Please believe fossil fuel funded climate deniers.
SenWhitehouse,Long article but a strong reminder of the disgusting effect dark money has had in our politics.⬆️
SenWhitehouse,I always expect American ingenuity and innovation to win the day — but particularly where we start with a 3x carbon intensity advantage!
SenWhitehouse,This @TheCLCouncil report shows how a carbon border adjustment levels the playing field &amp; rewards businesses that are doing things right. I’ll introduce my own soon.
SenWhitehouse,Americans are slashing carbon emissions &amp; making manufacturing cleaner. A border adjustment can help us benefit from that.
SenWhitehouse,The rotten Big Oil cartel is holding up the whole world while trying to brainwash people that the solution is more oil. Can we truly be that stupid?
SenWhitehouse,Oh dear. I’ve been sanctioned by a mass-murdering kleptocrat.
SenWhitehouse,Angus and Josh raise an important question: how is it that across the entire national security establishment (not just the IC) there was no dissenting voice anywhere suggesting Ukraine might win? Why such a blind spot? How to fix that?
SenWhitehouse,This week I met with a group of Ukrainian writers &amp; human rights defenders who experienced Russian’s brutal invasion firsthand. Thank you @PENamerica for facilitating this visit and defending free expression. 
SenWhitehouse,Smells like message-massaged masquerade to me. It’s not enough to “accelerate the energy transition” particularly not in tandem with more fossil fuel; we need to avoid a looming full-on catastrophe while we still can. 
SenWhitehouse,Dark money spending for the 2022 election cycle already totals more than $115 million – I’d like to knock that number down to zero. Let’s pass my DISCLOSE Act to empower voters and bring big donors out of the shadows.
SenWhitehouse,Big corporations are pouncing on this moment to boost profits and enrich their buddies on Wall Street. It’s time to stop them from jacking up prices for working Americans.
SenWhitehouse,Fun visit with @AnchorToffee Rhed’s Hot Sauce and all the amazing food businesses set up at @FarmFreshRI Food Hub. I’m glad to support the work Farm Fresh does to get healthy food into the community by delivering $581k in federal funding to help complete its Harvest Kitchen. 
SenWhitehouse,Proud to announce that @universityofRI has been awarded funding from Sea Grant DOE and NOAA to advance the stakeholder engagement process for future offshore wind projects. This is important work for our fishing &amp; coastal communities and I’m glad to see it happen in RI.
SenWhitehouse,Happy birthday to my pal @alfranken! Miss you.
SenWhitehouse,Drip drip drip...
SenWhitehouse,Great news! Under @RichGlickFERC's leadership @FERC has begun really important efforts like looking at ways to build more transmission infrastructure. That will boost our resiliency to extreme weather and better serve American consumers.
SenWhitehouse,You could knock a dollar off the price of gas tomorrow and the fossil fuel industry would still make money – that’s how grotesque their excess profits are. The industry is riding high on cartel prices and it’s time to bring them back down to earth. 
SenWhitehouse,Pretty astounding that the Department of Justice turns a blind eye to this to abundant academic research documenting the fraud to litigation under way all around the country and to its own successful tobacco case — an obvious litigation template.  
SenWhitehouse,These stories are real. These programs are good. They lifted Rhode Island families. We need permanent child tax credit and robust child/elder care support.
SenWhitehouse,
SenWhitehouse,
SenWhitehouse,It’s not just North Carolina. Rhode Island is losing homes to the sea and if you go to StormTools you can see how much worse it’s going to get.  
SenWhitehouse,To say the Court is “conservative” misses the role of dark-money interests in packing the Court their record of partisan wins at the Court and the variance from “conservative” doctrine in so many of those wins.
SenWhitehouse,Understanding what’s happening at the Court requires understanding the problem of “regulatory capture” (often called “agency capture”).
SenWhitehouse,Unitary executive theory in the 5th Circuit ruling: 
SenWhitehouse,This is what the Trump justices were appointed for. They auditioned for Senate Republicans &amp; big conservative donors by writing fringe opinions like this one. They want to see radical doctrines accepted by the Court that Dark Money Built – and imposed on the American public.
SenWhitehouse,Embracing this framework would grant a President nearly unchecked authority to use the government to do his political bidding. 
SenWhitehouse,But the court didn’t stop there. Anticipating a Republican president it weaponized another far-right legal doctrine that gained steam under Trump—the “unitary executive theory.”
SenWhitehouse,That means environmental protections would go out the window. It means predatory behavior from lenders. It means an America where corporations can buck off regulations and make life worse for everybody who isn't a shareholder or a CEO.
SenWhitehouse,If these judges had their way corporations &amp; special interests would be free of most regulation by agencies with political independence &amp; subject-matter expertise. Consumer safety &amp; well-being would be an afterthought beholden to the agenda of right-wing dark money groups.
SenWhitehouse,"The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals just used one of those hothouse theories to limit the SEC’s power to crack down on investment fraud. Known as the ""non-delegation doctrine"" it would gut public-interest regulations and make life in America look very different."
SenWhitehouse,First you need know it isn’t enough for right-wing donors to pack the courts with reliable judges; those judges need legal theories to justify their rulings. Enter the Scheme’s legal theory hothouse.
SenWhitehouse,The right-wing scheme to control our courts just scored a big win in the 5th Circuit – a win that threatens a huge array of protections for Americans’ health safety and environment. Here’s how -&gt; THREAD
SenWhitehouse,Our asset seizure plan will send a signal to Putin’s oligarchs that their days of thievery are numbered. All of their ill-gotten gains will be auctioned off and the proceeds will be sent to aid Ukraine. 
SenWhitehouse,It’s Quahog Week here in Rhode Island which means our local businesses &amp; markets are featuring this delicious mollusk on their menus. Check out @RhodeIslandDEM’s list of participating businesses here:  
SenWhitehouse,There’s a lot the administration can do right now to cut emissions and expand renewable energy in this country. Let’s get moving! 
SenWhitehouse,Full funding for FinCEN enforcement means better enforcement of my Corporate Transparency Act which will help bring kleptocrats drug traffickers and other bad actors to justice.
SenWhitehouse,This was not a real contest it was an operation.
SenWhitehouse,Please stop talking about this as a “win.” That implies something no longer true about the Court.  In fact Republican senators and the Roberts Six are working in tandem to change American democracy for right-wing dark-money oligarchs.
SenWhitehouse,And the folks funding that Court-packing effort and the folks funding Senate Republicans and the folks who benefit from the decision are the same folks.
SenWhitehouse,Talk about a closed loop: McGahn and McConnell get Gorsuch Kavanaugh and Barrett onto the Court then do a brief together telling them to unleash more special interest money and influence which they then do.
SenWhitehouse,Sad but true. It’s institutional — there’s no place in the great Democratic cat-herd where long-term strategy is the day-to-day job.
SenWhitehouse,Happy Birthday to #HeadStart! These programs have helped children and families succeed for 57 years – it’s an investment in our future that keeps paying off and generations of Americans are better off for it.
SenWhitehouse,The Court pretends that’s no problem while helping the secret donors with more and more secrecy: won’t fix amicus disclosure; won’t enforce spending transparency; opened the door to new constitutional right to dark money for political group.
SenWhitehouse,This is not a  “one bad apple” problem; it’s a problem of a Court captured by special interests full of judges chosen by big donors in back room of Federalist Society.
SenWhitehouse,Very glad to meet with advocates from @alzassocri to discuss ways Congress can support patients &amp; caregivers. You’re doing important work - thank you. 
SenWhitehouse,A great overview here from @RFF on how to craft what’s called a carbon border adjustment – a way to cut carbon pollution and boost cleaner American manufacturing. It’s a clear win-win. I’ll be putting this idea to use in a new bill – stay tuned.
SenWhitehouse,Those right-wing forces spread the white supremacist hate that fueled the violence in Buffalo.  They should answer for it.
SenWhitehouse,Thank goodness for courts where the victims of this horror can hold accountable news outlets politicians and far-right leaders who foment violence by amplifying racist messages. 
SenWhitehouse,We ought to be the City on a Hill; instead we’re a dark repository for dirty money. We need to close the loopholes end the secrecy and fund our enforcement agencies like Treasury’s FinCEN. 
SenWhitehouse,.@ZEROTOTHREE reports that in Rhode Island 67% of infants &amp; toddlers have moms who work. Affordable child care can change lives and open doors for families – let’s make it happen.
