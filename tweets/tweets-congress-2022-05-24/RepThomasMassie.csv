RepThomasMassie,Thank you to @CongressmanHice for cosponsoring my bill to audit the Federal Reserve HR 24. The American people benefit when we work to increase government transparency.
RepThomasMassie,A searchable federal registry of gun owners is illegal in this country so why is the ATF digitizing individual purchase records‚Ä¶ to be kept indefinitely?A national gun registry is a pre-requisite to gun confiscation. This must be stopped.
RepThomasMassie,Thank you to @HerreraBeutler for cosponsoring my bill to audit the Federal Reserve HR 24. The American people benefit when we work to increase government transparency.
RepThomasMassie,Cut all foreign aid. 
RepThomasMassie,@JayLock89590369 Everyone on that airplane was tested.
RepThomasMassie,In general elections you vote for a party.In primary elections you vote for a person.
RepThomasMassie,@NoahWWall I will never submit to political science! üòâ
RepThomasMassie,Mask wearing is a ritual. 
RepThomasMassie,.@Newsweek is still publishing fake news and promoting a false fact check by @BrowneEdd. They should delete the fact check or issue a correction. Comirnaty is not available in the United States. It was an agreed upon ‚Äúbait and switch‚Äù by the @US_FDA and @pfizer and @SecDef. 
RepThomasMassie,@AriellePruitt7 Typos and all. lol
RepThomasMassie,This Brit got the ratio he so richly deserved‚Ä¶ but I perhaps he deserves more. The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed‚Ä¶ and we‚Äôre sure as heck not going to take advice from the SOBs our founding fathers battled to gain our independence. 
RepThomasMassie,@JohnnyRebel0117 Done.
RepThomasMassie,Although the hue of my hair and the number of my chins has changed in 10 years my message has not: Printing money is going to destroy this country! Here‚Äôs a blast from the past: 
RepThomasMassie,Ross Ulbricht's (@RealRossU) sentence is the greatest violation of the Eighth Amendment that I'm aware of in the United States today. The Eighth Amendment prohibits the federal government from exacting cruel and unusual punishment. 
RepThomasMassie,@nhrulz Are you saying my algo for follows is simple? #sassywithmassie
RepThomasMassie,@BiblicalLift Not enough of my colleagues asked this question before rubber stamping the spending.
RepThomasMassie,This is an epic waste of taxpayer dollars and a depressing misdirection of human capability. 
RepThomasMassie,@singleplayerguy Why did you vote for the people who voted for the policies that caused this problem to start with?
RepThomasMassie,
RepThomasMassie,@JGreenblattADL Shame on you for not reading the resolution. 
RepThomasMassie,@SbredOldFriends It wouldn‚Äôt be the first time.See March 27 2020.
RepThomasMassie,I don‚Äôt hate anyone based on his or her ethnicity or religion. Legitimate government exists in part to punish those who commit unprovoked violence against others but government can‚Äôt legislate thought.This bill promoted internet censorship and violations of the 1st amendment 
RepThomasMassie,Thank you @NTU for keeping score and for letting taxpayers know who is looking out for them here in Congress. 
RepThomasMassie,If we just voted based on the names of the bills I‚Äôd vote for almost all of them.
RepThomasMassie,I condemn the Radical Left's last ditch effort to influence the Supreme Court through intimidation. 
RepThomasMassie,The biggest loser in last night‚Äôs primaries was @KyChamber.They backed all of the incumbent state representatives in NKY who lost their elections and they backed @SavannahLMaddox‚Äôs challenger who lost his. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èArticle by @joesonka
