RepYoungKim,As a mother and new grandmother I am gutted to hear of this tragic news at a Texas school. Whether it‚Äôs a place of learning or of worship no one should feel unsafe. My heart is with the victims their loved ones and the Uvalde community as we learn more.
RepYoungKim,I joined the Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church outside the Laguna Woods Church over the weekend to pray for strength and healing and to honor Dr. John Cheng's heroism. There is no place in our community or our society for hate.  
RepYoungKim,Looking forward to joining the @GuyBensonShow with @guypbenson in a few minutes around 1:05pm PT! Tune in on @foxnewsradio üéß:  
RepYoungKim,Amazing to be with @csuf ROTC students for their commissioning ceremony and to witness their first salute. These new officers will go on to a basic officer leadership course per their assigned branch and then to their first unit. Thank you for your service! üá∫üá∏ 
RepYoungKim,Another smash-and-grab theft in Orange County. Organized retail crime hurts small business owners &amp; endangers our communities. I introduced the Federal Investigations of Organized Retail Crime Act to help address these crimes &amp; keep communities safe. 
RepYoungKim,More evidence confirming what we already knew‚Äîthe Chinese government is committing genocide in Xinjiang against Uyghurs by brainwashing torture rape &amp; beatings.  We must pass my Uyghur Policy Act to strengthen U.S. leadership &amp; save lives in Xinjiang.
RepYoungKim,Thank you for having me! 
RepYoungKim,The government has no business controlling how Americans spend or save their hard-earned money. That's why I'm proud to join @RepDonaldsPress to introduce the Financial Freedom Act to protect retirement savers' ability to make their own investment choices.
RepYoungKim,Americans cannot afford more reckless spending.
RepYoungKim,Border security is vital to maintain our national security public safety &amp; economy. As we see the border crisis continue to reach record-high illegal migrant &amp; illicit drug encounters we must ensure our government makes border security a top priority. 
RepYoungKim,As long as this border crisis persists our communities suffer. That's why I introduced a bill to create a Southern border strategy and continue to urge the Biden administration to take action.Read my full thoughts for @ocropinion @ocregister üóûÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è
RepYoungKim,Freedom is not free. Thank you to the brave men and women who have answered the call to serve in our nation‚Äôs uniform. We are grateful for your service and sacrifice always! üá∫üá∏ #ArmedForcesDay 
RepYoungKim,The impact of inflation is felt by every American.  Enough with the tax-and-spend spree. It's past time for common sense pro-growth policies to get our economy moving again. 
RepYoungKim,I always enjoy seeing #CA39 faces in our nation's capital! I enjoyed visiting with students and teachers from Loving Savior of the Hills Lutheran School in #ChinoHills this week. 
RepYoungKim,Great to meet with @endalzoc advocates Vy &amp; Bill from #CA39 to discuss Alzheimer‚Äôs disease research &amp; treatment.I'm proud to support the Alzheimer's Caregiver Support Act &amp; the Comprehensive Care for Alzheimer‚Äôs Act to support individuals &amp; families facing this disease. #ENDAlz 
RepYoungKim,Amelia Earhart became the first woman to make a nonstop solo transatlantic flight #OTD in 1932 piloting a Lockheed Vega 5B. She was a trailblazer and her courage continues to inspire generations of women in #STEM.  üõ©Ô∏èüë©‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è 
RepYoungKim,Border security is national security! RT if you agree.
RepYoungKim,Taiwan has proven to be a leader in global health security and deserves to have a seat at the table at #WHA75. 
RepYoungKim,Rising crime endangering the public safety of our Southern California communities and state and local policies are incentivizing criminals.  Supporting our law enforcement who put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe should not be controversial.
RepYoungKim,Inflation is making it harder for families to put food on the table and pay bills.The Biden administration blames everyone but themselves for inflation that has soared under their watch. That's why I introduced the CPI Act to ensure the federal government prioritizes this.
RepYoungKim,As a mom who relied on baby formula to feed my kids &amp; a new grandma to two babies I'm outraged that parents are struggling to find formula. I voted in support of the Access to Baby Formula Act which I cosponsor &amp; will keep fighting to fix this crisis.
RepYoungKim,Speaker Pelosi and Democrats blocked a bill promoting U.S. energy six times and are instead taking a step out of Venezuela's economic playbook with government price controls. This isn't the way to lower prices hold companies accountable or help our economy. It's socialism.
RepYoungKim,Lowering energy costs reducing emissions and keeping communities running requires use of all of the tools in our arsenal.That's why I was proud to help introduce H.R. 4394 to support environmentally-friendly options like nuclear energy and hydropower. 
RepYoungKim,All students should have the opportunity to reach their potential and achieve their dream.California's proposed math equity framework standardizes a race to the bottom limiting opportunities for students and hurting U.S. competitiveness.
RepYoungKim,President Biden continues to cozy up to socialist authoritarians in Venezuela and Cuba by relaxing sanctions.  Appeasement for dictators will only tighten their grip on power undermine freedom and democracy and fuel more human rights abuses.
RepYoungKim,After witnessing hate crimes assaults &amp; robberies in his community Chuck Sun launched the Together Against Crime Foundation (TACF) which is now about 1000 members strong. Before founding TACF he spent nearly 40 years as a successful aerospace engineer. #APAHM 
RepYoungKim,Inflation does not discriminate ‚Äì it impacts every American and is hurting workers families and small businesses. We need pro-growth policies to support our job creators create meaningful workforce opportunities and get our economy back on track. 
RepYoungKim,May is Mental Health Awareness Month and an important reminder to check in on one another. We all can do our part to create kinder communities. I encourage anyone who may be struggling to call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) and press 1 if you are veteran. 
RepYoungKim,The Biden administration is still pushing to end the Title 42 policy. The border crisis continues to get worse. That's why @RepMichaelGuest &amp; I introduced a bill to create a Southern border strategy.  
RepYoungKim,Sacramento is RAISING the gas tax in July while gas prices are $6 per gallon in California &amp; the state has a $98B budget surplus.This makes no sense.  @RepDavidValadao &amp; I wrote to @GavinNewsom in March to suspend the gas tax. I continue to urge him to reverse course.
