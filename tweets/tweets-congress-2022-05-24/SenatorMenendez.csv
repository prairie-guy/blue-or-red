SenatorMenendez,This CAN and MUST change. Thoughts and prayers are not enough. #EndGunViolence
SenatorMenendez,There are just no words to express the pain these parents are feeling today.My prayers are with each of these families and with the teachers and employees at this school. No matter how much Republicans say otherwise this is not just some inevitable cost of freedom. 
SenatorMenendez,Among my conversations with world leaders this weekend I spoke with our Ambassador in Switzerland who helped negotiate these shipments of baby formula. I’m happy to report that the first pallets have already arrived in the U.S. and more are headed to our area this week. 
SenatorMenendez,We will never stop trying to protect our communities from gun violence. But the reality is that there have been two constants throughout the decade since Sandy Hook… More mass shootings and yet not a single Republican with the courage to stand up to the gun lobby. 
SenatorMenendez,And don’t forget to sign up so you don’t miss future updates ➡️ 
SenatorMenendez,ICYMI: Yesterday I sent out an update on our efforts to address the baby formula shortage along with some resources for families that are struggling.Read the full update HERE:
SenatorMenendez,Too often survivable injuries turn fatal because of a lack of access to bleeding control kits. Last week on STOP THE BLEED Day I introduced My Prevent BLEEDing Act to provide resources that can save lives while waiting for first responders to arrive.
SenatorMenendez,Make no mistake our foreign policy has a tremendous impact on our state our economy and our day-to-day lives. That’s why I’m working to get our China competition bill over the finish line to help create and preserve over 91000 NJ jobs. 
SenatorMenendez,Congratulations to John P. Stevens High School for advancing to the National Science Bowl Finals! Good luck in today’s competition I know you’ll make New Jersey Proud! 
SenatorMenendez,To all the men and women in our military we are so thankful for the sacrifice you make each and every day to keep our country and our people safe and we greatly appreciate your families who share in that sacrifice. Happy #ArmedForcesDay! 
SenatorMenendez,An incredible win for the World Cup-dominating @uswnt — but we can’t stop here. Let this announcement by @USSoccer propel us forward as we work to close the wage gap for ALL women and guarantee equal protection under the law.
SenatorMenendez,I commend the Biden Administration for announcing their intent to appeal and I urge them to continue their preparations for the eventual end of Title 42 as determined by the CDC.
SenatorMenendez,This is a misguided decision that will continue to erode our immigration laws. Title 42 is a public health policy that undermines border security and Democrats should stand united in opposing it.
SenatorMenendez,COVID boosters are now available for kids 5+. If you're a parent now is a good time to consult with your doctor and take the necessary steps to keep your kids happy AND healthy.
SenatorMenendez,Hell no.If Republicans are looking for another safe space for their hatred and bigotry New Jersey ain't it.Here we support our neighbors and welcome them with open arms no matter who they are or who they love.
SenatorMenendez,🧐 Shot:                              Chaser: 
SenatorMenendez,38 states have already ratified the #EqualRightsAmendment but an arbitrary deadline is standing in the way of making it the law of the land. This should not be a partisan issue. There should be no time limit on equality. We need the #ERANow. 
SenatorMenendez,🤔I’m not sure “You would know better if you’d read every word of the racist’s disgusting manifesto like I have” is the witty burn that @TuckerCarlson thinks it is…The fact of the matter is that his non-stop spewing of conspiracy theories is part of the problem. 
SenatorMenendez,Every American household can now order another round of free at-home COVID tests right to their door. These tests are essential as we continue to live with this virus but the $10-$20 per test can quickly overwhelm family budgets. Thank you @POTUS for easing this burden. 
SenatorMenendez,The research conducted by Rutgers' @NJGVRC lays bare the cowardice of my Republican colleagues who would rather hide behind thoughts and prayers than lift a finger on common-sense gun reforms.Tune in on Friday as we discuss how we can keep you and your family safe. 
SenatorMenendez,Together with @SenatorLujan and @RepCardenas I'm more committed than ever to holding these companies accountable for preventing bad actors from undermining public health efforts and instilling distrust in our democratic institutions.
SenatorMenendez,Mis/disinformation is a problem in every corner of social media but Spanish-language mis/disinformation is especially pervasive. WhatsApp Signal and Telegram ought to invest in tools to slow and prevent the spread of such content in Latino communities.
SenatorMenendez,This #NationalPoliceWeek we honor all the brave officers who selflessly protect our communities in New Jersey in our nation’s capital and all over the country. 
SenatorMenendez,Unfortunately stories like Nahema's are becoming all too common; we can't rely on the big banks and Zelle to hold each other accountable because the only interest they share is making profits.That's why I will continue holding their feet to the fire. 
SenatorMenendez,That’s why I was proud to report I am introducing new legislation with @SenatorCollins to reauthorize the National Alzheimer's Project which will provide and modernize resources to defeat this disease and promote prevention. 
SenatorMenendez,I truly believe that - thanks in no small part to the hard work of the dedicated advocates I met with today - we’re closer than ever to putting an end to this disease I refuse to let up on the critical work of securing the programs and funding we need to finish the fight.
SenatorMenendez,Great to welcome members of @AlzAssnGNJ to talk about our shared commitment to fighting for Alzheimer’s patients their families and caregivers. My passion for emerging victorious in this fight has only grown in the years since I lost my mother to this devastating disease.
