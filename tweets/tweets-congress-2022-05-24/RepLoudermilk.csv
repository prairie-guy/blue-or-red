RepLoudermilk,
RepLoudermilk,[2/2] if Title 42 ends➡️May 23  – The date President Biden said he will allow Title 42 to expire The courts must not allow Title 42 to end!
RepLoudermilk,[1/2] Border crisis facts: ➡️750000 – number of illegal immigrants Biden’s DHS has released into the U.S.➡️1.8 million – number of times Title 42 has been used to expel illegal immigrants➡️18000 – number of daily encounters CBP predicts – more than double current average...
RepLoudermilk,To put ONE month of immigrants crossing our border (234088) in perspective…that's more people illegally coming across our southern border than exists in 99% of the cities or towns in the United States. 
RepLoudermilk,"Biden's pick to head this board engaged in misinformation herself by supporting the discredited Steele Dossier and saying the Hunter Biden laptop story wasn't true. Leave it to the mainstream media to characterize facts as ""right-wing attacks."" "
RepLoudermilk,President Biden is doing everything possible to make the crisis at our southern border worse. But the solutions are simple: ➡️Finish the border wall➡️Enforce “remain in Mexico” policy➡️Reinstate asylum agreements with El Salvador Guatemala &amp; Honduras➡️Continue with Title 42
