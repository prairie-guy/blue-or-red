RepMondaire,Team Mondaire is on the move!Two members of my casework team will be at the Finkelstein Library tomorrow from 3:30-5:30pm to answer your questions and lend a hand—and they've got take-home COVID tests available for you.Be sure to stop by!
RepMondaire,Raise your hand if you believe that billionaires shouldn’t be paying less in taxes than teachers and firefighters. ✋
RepMondaire,Exxon BP and Chevron raking in record profits while raising prices for working families isn’t “capitalism”—it’s corporate greed.
RepMondaire,Today would be a great day to #CancelStudentDebt.
RepMondaire,Call me radical but four companies shouldn’t control 90% of the baby formula market.
RepMondaire,I just voted to ban Big Oil's price-gouging—working families are simply paying too much at the pump.Enough is enough.
RepMondaire,My Republican colleagues want to end the right to abortion and let the government imprison patients and their doctors.Apparently to them that's what democracy looks like.That isn’t democracy—it’s servitude. 
RepMondaire,Abortion is health care. Pass it on.
RepMondaire,Labor unions are key to building a strong middle-class—and I'm fighting tooth and nail to protect their right to organize.Proud to stand alongside @UAW workers today and always. 
RepMondaire,Happy birthday to this little guy who wanted to change the world—but didn’t know if he could. Take it from me it’s damn worth trying. 😉 
RepMondaire,Raise your hand if you’re one of the 55% of Americans who support expanding the Supreme Court. ✋
