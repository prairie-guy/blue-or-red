RepAlGreen,
RepAlGreen,Tonight at 8pm CT I’ll be joining Houston’s Community Station KPFT 90.1. Tune in to hear more about the importance of denouncing white supremacy and invidious discrimination in all its evil forms. 
RepAlGreen,Today I spoke on the House floor about how everybody has a duty to stand up and speak out against hate and acts of hatred. My full remarks: 
RepAlGreen,We must continue speaking out against hate in light of the Buffalo NY mass shooting. If we fail to prosecute hate we fail our country. 
RepAlGreen,Homophobia is antithetical to American ideals &amp; has no place in our society. On International Day Against Homophobia Biphobia &amp; Transphobia and every single day I’m standing with the LGBTQ+ community to continue fighting for equal opportunity to love &amp; happiness. 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
RepAlGreen,Every May we observe Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month to honor the history contributions and accomplishments of the AAPI community. I could not have been prouder to celebrate it this year than with a visit to the @WhiteHouse alongside @POTUS and my AAPI friends. 
RepAlGreen,It was a pleasure to welcome Prime Minister of Greece Kyriakos Mitsotakis to our nation’s Capitol today. 🇬🇷Thank you @kmitsotakis for reminding us of the common values and shared democratic principles that continue to unite our countries. 
RepAlGreen,I VOTED! ✅The foundation security &amp; success of our democracy relies on the power of the vote. So please dear friends I implore you to head to polls &amp; be the change you wish to see in the world. For more on the May 24th election visit:
