RepJohnRose,I don’t think “incredible” when every gas station I pass is charging more than $4.10/gal. This administration could lower prices at the pump by embracing American energy and ending our dependency on foreign oil. It’s that simple.
RepJohnRose,This formula shortage is about more than Biden's FDA dragging their feet.  It's about a pattern of misguided priorities and poor leadership. It all adds up.  Unfortunately I wouldn't be surprised to see other shortages in the future. 
RepJohnRose,There's no good reason why businesses should be able to deny cold hard cash. I'm glad a bill I cosponsored to require businesses to accept cash passed the Financial Services Committee this week. Cash is still king! 
RepJohnRose,Every third Saturday in May we honor the many men and women serving in the various branches of the military. Thank you for your service! 
RepJohnRose,"Big thanks to @tennesseetech Child Development teachers &amp; staff for a great end of school ""Flip Out"" for our boys &amp; all their buddies. It was an awesome summer send off. "
RepJohnRose,This is another example of Democrats not seriously legislating.  When faced with a serious crisis they choose to score political points instead of helping families struggling to feed their children.  Just another day in Democratic one-party rule Washington.
RepJohnRose,"I voted ""No"" on this clearly partisan bill that faces serious challenges by the Senate because of its partisan nature.  I support Republicans' plan to use existing funds for food-related supply chain disruptions to be used to address the current shortage of infant formula."
RepJohnRose,Speaker Pelosi's baby formula funding bill will do nothing to address the root causes of this problem.  President Biden's FDA has mismanaged this crisis from the get and now Congressional Democrats want to send them millions more to increase their bureaucracy and red tape. 
RepJohnRose,234088. That's how many illegal immigrant encounters were reported last month at the southern border.It's obvious this administration which had no problem stopping border wall construction or ending Title 42 doesn't take the crisis seriously.President Biden must do better. 
RepJohnRose,I want to thank everyone on the Arnold Community Council for coming to D.C. to advocate for AEDC the communities that surround it and the small businesses that directly benefit from the important work going on there. 
RepJohnRose,The FDA has moved too slowly to reopen the Abbott baby formula plant in Michigan.Now instead of American producers and the free market fixing this supply issue parents will be forced to rely on foreign manufacturers to feed their babies much like we're doing with oil. 
RepJohnRose,I'm concerned by the growing crime rate across the country. Murders assaults and robberies are all up from previous years. We must stand with law enforcement - and reject any ridiculous demand to defund the police. 
RepJohnRose,I ran for Congress to fight for hard-working Tennessee families. I never expected I'd have to fight for them to be able to feed their newborns. President Biden and the FDA need to stop dragging their feet and provide answers on how they plan to address the #BabyFormulaCrisis 
RepJohnRose,This #NationalPoliceWeek I hope you’ll join me in saying thank you to all those who so bravely work to keep our neighborhoods safe. I will always Back the Blue and condemn any effort to defund them.
