RepMcGovern,I'm sick &amp; tired of the excuses. As an American. As a Congressman. As a dad. I'm disgusted by this senseless violenceâ€”and by the fact that some in Congress care more about the NRA's money than about kids getting shot at school.Thoughts &amp; prayers aren't enough. We need ACTION! 
RepMcGovern,Putin barred Biden from entering Russiaâ€¦ but not Trump.Of course! Why would he want to sanction his #1 fan?Clearly Trumpâ€™s persistent praise and twisted affinity for Putin continue to buy his love and respect.
RepMcGovern,Telling the story of the horrors of the Armenian Genocide will help make sure never again means never again.  Soledad your fatherâ€™s story is an inspiration. I was honored to meet you &amp; the Cotter family. Thank you for your part in preserving his story for posterity. 
RepMcGovern,Ginni Thomasâ€™ conduct only gets worse. We now know she was directly involved in the planning of January 6 &amp; lobbying officials to overturn the election results. We need answers about just how seriously conflicted Justice Thomas really is.  
RepMcGovern,President Biden &amp; @HouseDemocrats are taking action on behalf of Americaâ€™s parents &amp; taking the baby formula shortage head on. Operation Fly Formula is importing 1.5 million bottles of formula to the U.S. to immediately be stocked on store shelves. 
RepMcGovern,When push came to shove 192 Republicans voted against baby formula. I guess legislating doesnâ€™t play well on MAGA Twitter. 
RepMcGovern,Today I learned that Putinâ€™s government has permanently banned me from entering Russia. I accept this sanction as a badge of honor for speaking up for human rights opposing Russiaâ€™s war crimes in Ukraine &amp; standing on the right side of history. 
RepMcGovern,Uxbridge Millville Bellingham &amp; Mendon I really enjoyed listening to your thoughts and answering your questions.Â These are just the first two stops for this yearâ€™s coffee with your congressman listening tour. Keep an eye out because Iâ€™ll be in your neighborhood soon! 
RepMcGovern,Grafton Sutton Northbridge &amp; Upton thanks for getting coffee with me!Â I loved hearing directly from you about how I can best advocate for you and your families in Washington. 
RepMcGovern,Hunger is a political condition. We have the money. We have the food. Yet millions of Americans go hungry every day.Itâ€™s time we ditched the old playbook â€“ and went big! Itâ€™s only with that kind of thinking how weâ€™ll end hunger in America. 
RepMcGovern,Thanks for having me @chamberworc to talk about the economy current events and how we can help local companies thrive.

RepMcGovern,Remember when you pay at the pump: Big Oil companies like Exxon Shell BP and Chevron are making huge profits by price gouging consumers.@HouseDemocrats just passed a bill to hold them accountable for their greed &amp; deception.Every single Republican in Congress voted no. 
RepMcGovern,House Democrats just passed an emergency bill to get baby formula back on the shelves help the FDA ensure existing products are safe &amp; make sure this never happens again.192 Republicans voted no. They voted against baby formula. 
RepMcGovern,@JPJones1812 This is an âœ¨entire thread âœ¨about things we are doing to fix it.
RepMcGovern,Next tonight @HouseDemocrats will vote on an additional emergency measure to provide urgently-needed flexibility so low-income parents can purchase safe formula with their WIC benefits during these extenuating circumstances.I hope this bill gets strong bipartisan support.
RepMcGovern,Meanwhile @POTUS Biden &amp; the @WhiteHouse are taking swift decisive coordinated steps on behalf of parentsâ€”invoking the Defense Production Act launching Operation Fly Formula to import safe products rapidly &amp; working directly with producers to get formula on the shelf ASAP. 
RepMcGovern,This is a scary situation and Democrats are taking immediate action on behalf of parents.Yesterday as Chairman of the Rules Committee I helped advance an emergency bill to address the formula shortage. 
RepMcGovern,The baby formula shortage is happening because of corporate negligence &amp; greed.Four companies control nearly 90% of the market for formula. And formula manufacturer Abbott made huge profits while their leadership ignored safety warnings that led to this recall. 
RepMcGovern,Creative workers are integral to our economy in Massachusetts. The Workforce Innovation &amp; Opportunity Act the house just passed included my amendment inspired by @MASSCreative to support creative workers &amp; ensure they are integrated into in-demand industries &amp; occupations!

RepMcGovern,57 years ago Head Start welcomed its first class of students giving them a strong foundation to take on lifeâ€™s biggest challenges. Today the program has benefitted millions of children and families across American.Happy Birthday @NatlHeadStart! 
RepMcGovern,Putin doesnâ€™t care if he creates a global food crisis. By holding up Ukrainian agricultural exports &amp; destroying farming equipment Russian troops are wreaking havoc on the worldâ€™s supply.Thank you @SecVilsack for offering Americaâ€™s full support to those who are hungry. 
RepMcGovern,Shell just made $9.1 billion in quarterly profits. Exxon Mobil &amp; Chevron brag about enriching their shareholders.Yet the GOP won't say a single bad word about big oilâ€”theyâ€™d rather defend corporate price gouging &amp; blame President Biden than work with us to solve problems.
