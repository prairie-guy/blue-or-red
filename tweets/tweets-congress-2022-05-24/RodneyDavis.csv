RodneyDavis,This is pure evil and heartbreaking - 14 children and 1 teacher were murdered in an act of senseless violence. Please pray for the victims their families and the Uvalde Texas community. 
RodneyDavis,You can learn more about my bill here: 
RodneyDavis,In these challenging economic times with record inflation &amp; rising input costs we need to do everything we can to ensure burdensome regs aren't hindering growth. More than ever farmers &amp; ranchers need good farm policy across the board not more bureaucratic Biden Admin red tape
RodneyDavis,.@farmcredit is a key part of the economy in rural America. The Biden Admin’s attempt to impose additional financial regulations on the System will make credit less available to farm families &amp; rural areas. That's why I introduced the Farm Credit Admin Independent Authority Act. 
RodneyDavis,Fortunately @RepBost and I were successful in blocking Pritzker in the House but Senators are pushing this policy in the Senate. As debate over WRDA continues Rep. Bost and I will continue to advocate for these provisions to stay out of the final bill.
RodneyDavis,Pritzker and his left-wing allies are already forcing electric rates higher with their energy policies. On top of rising energy costs and historic inflation the last thing communities in central and southern IL need to pay more for is water which is what Pritzker is pushing. 
RodneyDavis,Assisting with disaster preparedness and mitigation is an important partnership the federal government has with our local communities. Taxpayers are well-served when investments are made on the front-end to mitigate natural disasters like flooding before it occurs.
RodneyDavis,I’m honored to be recognized by the @floodcoalition. I represent many river communities who face flood risk and I’m working in Congress to make sure they have tools and resources to protect their infrastructure property and lives from natural disasters. 
RodneyDavis,I’m here to serve you. This #ConstituentServiceSpotlight is another example of how my office and I can help. Reach out if we can ever be of assistance:
