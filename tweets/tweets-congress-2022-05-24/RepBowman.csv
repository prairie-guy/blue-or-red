RepBowman,14 babies lost today. Our kids are our pride and joy. When will they finally be prioritized?
RepBowman,Have you followed me on TikTok yet?Make sure to give me a follow to keep up on everything I’m doing in Congress some occasional rap videos and watch my first TikTok live tomorrow with @EliseJoshi from @genzforchange.
RepBowman,These insane conspiracies that are showing up in white supremacy screeds and Tucker Carlson’s show must be formally condemned at the highest levels of government.They’re rooted in hate fear and violence and they have to go.
RepBowman,Make sure to incorporate a little self-care into your life each and every day.You and your mental health are so important.
RepBowman,Every child including undocumented kids deserves access to earn childhood education and care. That’s why #CareForAllFamilies is demanding that NYC’s FY23 budget allocates $10 million to expand programming to every kid no matter their immigration status.
RepBowman,Our public schools are in desperate need of funding and The Green New Deal for Public Schools would solve so many of the issues they’re facing.It would fund green retrofits hire and train more teachers make sure our kids have clean water and more.Our kids deserve more.
RepBowman,Throughout the pandemic we’ve seen how corporations and billionaires have increased their worth by billions.Meanwhile Americans are struggling to pay their bills. That’s why we need to tax the rich with my Ending Corporate Greed Act and my Babies Over Billionaires Act.
RepBowman,The monopoly on baby formula that exists in this country is unbelievably detrimental to our society and to our kids. We need to break them up so our babies don’t continue to go hungry.
RepBowman,Join myself and @EliseJoshi from @genzforchange live May 25th on TikTok! We’ll be discussing everything from the Green New Deal for Public Schools to Babies Over Billionaires to how you can help get these pieces of legislation passed.Follow here:  
RepBowman,I’m one of the 43 million Americans experiencing what it’s like to have thousands in student debt.@POTUS must cancel student debt today so that millions can finally have the financial freedom they deserve.
RepBowman,Meet one of the newest members of Team Bowman Morgan!Morgan is a District Aide and is always helping constituents. She’s also in the middle of completing her Master’s in Public Administration.We always support getting more education in this office! 
RepBowman,Today’s SCOTUS decision of Shinn v. Martinez Ramirez is an abomination.The ruling will force many who were convicted to remain incarcerated and once at a federal court not allow them to present evidence of ineffective counsel at a state court.
RepBowman,I’m grateful to @POTUS for enacting the Defense Production Act to help ease the baby formula shortage.Our babies need food. Yet almost 200 Republicans thought their constituents’ kids didn’t.
RepBowman,This weekend I was able to go to so many events in our community including visiting the Williamsbridge NAACP a dinner with Muslim Indian Americans and a legislative breakfast. Check it out! 
RepBowman,We’ve experienced immense trauma over the past few years and our kids are suffering.That’s why on Friday I met with the @Surgeon_General to discuss how we can support our youth throughout this mental health crisis.
RepBowman,We need to root out the evil that is white supremacy and the great replacement theory. It has no place in our country.At all levels of government we must condemn this evil.
RepBowman,Why did nearly 200 Republicans vote against providing $28 million to ease the baby formula shortage?It’s because Republicans always prioritize profits over people. Including our babies. It’s sickening.
RepBowman,Make sure to spend some time this weekend taking care of yourself.Whether it’s going to the gym cooking reading or hanging out with friends and family you deserve to take time for yourself.
RepBowman,This Wednesday at 7pm I’ll be going live with @EliseJoshi from @genzforchange on TikTok!You’re not going to want to miss this. We’ll be talking about how we can push for progressive policies what you can do to help and more.Follow me on TikTok here:  
RepBowman,Today may be one of the hottest days on record in New York for May. There’s no question the climate is warming and that we don’t have the infrastructure in place to help those who are struggling.We need the Heating and Cooling Relief Act so everyone can turn on their AC.
RepBowman,There’s a lot of hatred and racism in our society. We need to do better.It’s time we lead with love.
RepBowman,The housing market has been exclusionary and unaffordable for decades. It has purposely left behind Black and brown people.That’s why I introduced the Affordable CO-OP Act to work towards ensuring housing works for everyone not just the wealthy.
RepBowman,If we really wanted to have the best schooling system in the world we wouldn’t commodify education.Yet over 43 million Americans are in debt for wanting an education. @POTUS it’s time to cancel student debt.
RepBowman,Monopolies are not meant to serve people they’re meant for corporations to earn insane profits.Our babies are suffering at the hands of the baby formula monopoly. Their profits are not more important than our kids.
RepBowman,This morning I met with the @Surgeon_General to discuss what we can address the youth mental health crisis.There's no question that our youth are suffering and they need more support than ever. 
RepBowman,This weekend the East Coast will be undergoing record high temperatures. Yet many will be unable to turn on their AC and may experience heat related illnesses.@SenMarkey and I wrote the Heating and Cooling Relief Act so one has to choose between their health and their bills.
RepBowman,A few months ago @SenBooker and I released the African American History Act to urge everyone to tell the truth about our nation’s history.We have a history of racism and white nationalism and now more than ever we must face it head on.
RepBowman,One thing we can do help the economy is cancel student debt.If @POTUS cancels student debt 43 million Americans will receive financial freedom. All they wanted was an education.
RepBowman,No parent should have to struggle to find their child’s baby formula on the shelves.Abbott Nutrition must be held accountable for their monopoly on our baby’s food.Thank you @POTUS for enacting the Defense Production Act to ensure baby formula gets to our babies. 
RepBowman,I’ve been working towards ensuring all of our students get a Green New Deal for Public Schools. Yesterday several amendments of mine were passed to bring some of the GND4PS into the Rebuild America’s Schools Act. Our students deserve the best. 
RepBowman,Our kids are going through the worst youth mental health crisis of their lives.We need to pass legislation to provide our kids with the mental health support that they require. It’s non-negotiable.
RepBowman,The fight to protect Roe v Wade isn’t over.Abortion rights must be secured. Justice Alito’s draft opinion was written with a white supremacy mindset. It’s despicable.
RepBowman,My National Day of Healing Resolution designates today May 18th as a National Day of Healing. Our country has experienced immense trauma violence and more over the past few decades but we’ve never stopped to heal.Let’s take the time we need to heal. 
RepBowman,Two of my amendments to the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act passed the House last night.I’m proud to always be fighting for our youth. 
RepBowman,Rabbi Robinson is an incredible member of our community and we wanted to highlight him for Jewish Heritage Month. Check it out! 
RepBowman,Hey @POTUS I think it’s time to cancel student debt.
RepBowman,We have another mark up session in @EdlaborCmte today. Make sure to check it out we have some great bills in committee.You can watch here: 
RepBowman,We are experiencing a nationwide baby formula shortage due to Abbott Nutrition’s corporate greed.That’s why myself along with @RepPressley @RepJayapal and @RepGraceMeng wrote to @POTUS asking him to do everything in his power to get baby formula to those who need it.
