SpeakerPelosi,Last week @HouseDemocrats passed an Emergency Supplemental Appropriation providing $28 million to give the FDA the resources needed to address the baby formula shortage and help ensure that it never happens again. 192 Republicans shamefully voted against it. 
SpeakerPelosi,I also salute President Biden for signing @RepJahanaHayes &amp; @HouseDemocrats’ Access to Baby Formula Act a strong action improving access to infant formula through the Women Infant and Children’s program &amp; for issuing new FDA guidance to bring more formula into the U.S. market.
SpeakerPelosi,Democrats are continuing our work to address the infant formula shortage. I applaud the strong action that @POTUS is taking #ForTheChildren and his leadership in responding to the baby formula shortage in a way that is swift &amp; safe. 
SpeakerPelosi,Harvey often spoke about “hope for a better world hope for a better tomorrow.” In honoring his remarkable legacy let us recommit to preserving that hope for a new generation rooting out bigotry &amp; living up to the full promise of American Democracy. 
SpeakerPelosi,#HarveyMilkDay is an opportunity to celebrate the strength passion and vision of an extraordinary leader whose legacy continues to inspire people around the world. Today and every day we remember the joyful fight he waged to overcome hate and build a brighter future. 
SpeakerPelosi,See what else happened around the United Sates Capitol this week with my Medium post ‘Madam Speaker.’ 
SpeakerPelosi,This week I joined Members of Congress for @CAPAC’s candle lighting in remembrance of lives lost to anti-AAPI hate. Democrats will never relent in our fight to stop AAPI hate. 
SpeakerPelosi,As Speaker of the House I offered a full endorsement of their request to join NATO the greatest defense alliance in the history of the world. Their courage in responding to the Russian invasion has been a lesson and a model to the world. 
SpeakerPelosi,It was a great honor to welcome two champions of liberty Democracy and security to the United States Capitol this week: His Excellency Sauli Niinistö President of the Republic of Finland and Her Excellency Magdalena Andersson Prime Minister of Sweden. 
SpeakerPelosi,The domestic terrorism legislation we passed this week will help save lives protect communities and uphold our founding ideal: E Pluribus Unum.

SpeakerPelosi,Today @HouseDemocrats passed the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act to prevent Big Oil from #RippingOffAmericans at the pump. This legislation will crack down on oil companies imposing exploitive excessive unfair energy prices on America’s families.

SpeakerPelosi,The children of Northern Ireland who have never known the bloody conflict and do not want to go back deserve a future free of the violence where all may reach their fulfillment.
SpeakerPelosi,Respectful of the will of the British people and of Brexit I urge constructive collaborative and good-faith negotiations to implement an agreement that upholds peace.
SpeakerPelosi,As I have stated in my conversations with the Prime Minister the Foreign Secretary &amp; Members of the House of Commons if the United Kingdom chooses to undermine the Good Friday Accords the Congress cannot &amp; will not support a bilateral free trade agreement with the U.K.
SpeakerPelosi,It is deeply concerning that the United Kingdom now seeks to unilaterally discard the Northern Ireland Protocol which preserves the important progress and stability forged by the Accords. It continues to enjoy strong bipartisan &amp; bicameral support in the United States Congress.
SpeakerPelosi,The Good Friday Accords are the bedrock of peace in Northern Ireland and a beacon of hope for the world. Ensuring there is no physical border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland is necessary for upholding this landmark agreement which transformed Northern Ireland.

SpeakerPelosi,Bringing to bear awe-inspiring strength and fortitude these patriots braved dangerous waters to help defend democracy in our nation – and for the world. Nearly eight decades later Americans owe our Merchant Mariners an enormous debt of gratitude. 
SpeakerPelosi,Facing aerial bombings from above and submarine attacks from below America's Merchant Mariners dutifully delivered weapons and supplies to every theater of the war. President Roosevelt called their mission “the most difficult and dangerous transportation job ever undertaken.” 
SpeakerPelosi,Today it was my honor to present the Congressional Gold Medal to the Merchant Mariners of World War II in recognition of their bravery and outstanding service. May this medal serve as an expression of our nation's profound respect and admiration for these American heroes.
