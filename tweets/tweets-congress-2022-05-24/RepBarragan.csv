RepBarragan,I'm so sick of this! My heart hurts right now.Another mass shooting in this country.We've barely said goodbye to those we lost in the  #Buffalo mass shooting - now 14 CHILDREN &amp; a teacher shot dead in #Uvalde TX. There are too many guns &amp; they're too easy to get. PERIOD.
RepBarragan,Kevin Cardoso is training for a job in healthcare - to improve health outcomes in his community.I secured $925k in federal funding for ⁦@EastLACollege⁩ South Gate for new equipment &amp; labs to enhance training for local residents like Kevin. #CA44 
RepBarragan,This is not about public health. This is about keeping Latino &amp; Black migrants out. Why would any state need notice that FEDERAL GOVT is returning to status quo of following THE LAW &amp; processing asylum seekers at the border. Same way we'd done it for decades prior to pandemic.
RepBarragan,This ruling is absolute nonsense. So @CDCgov has unilateral emergency authority under #Title42 to take action - but when they determine emergency conditions no longer exist they must rely on a protracted notice &amp; comment period to end the action? Would set dangerous precedent. 
RepBarragan,Great news! @AFSCMECouncil36 @cwuafscme and @MOCAlosangeles reached agreement on a union contract. This is good for workers the museum the community and the arts in LA. #ArtforAll #faircontract 
RepBarragan,Proud to speak for @HispanicCaucus alongside @SpeakerPelosi @WhipClyburn @RepBrianHiggins &amp; our @TheBlackCaucus &amp; @CAPAC sisters &amp; brothers today.  Spoke out against hate &amp; right-wing domestic terrorism. Against racist lies that led to the loss of 10 Black lives in #Buffalo. 
RepBarragan,It is critical that moms across #CA44 are able to find &amp; buy formula to feed their babies. The current shortage is unacceptable.Took action alongside my fellow @HouseDemocrats tonight to loosen WIC restrictions for buying formula &amp; help FDA end the current shortage. 
RepBarragan,On CA Education Support Professionals Day I want to recognize our wonderful #CA44 office workers bus drivers food service workers custodians paraprofessionals maintenance staff &amp; other support staff in our local schools. You keep our education system running. Thank you!
