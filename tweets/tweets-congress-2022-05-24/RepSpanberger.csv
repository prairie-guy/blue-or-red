RepSpanberger,I am praying for the wounded the families forever changed and our nation.
RepSpanberger,14 children and a teacher were murdered at their school today in Texas.This cannot be the violent reality that we accept for our children. Parents are mourning their babies tonight and Congress must act to take up commonsense gun violence prevention legislation. 
RepSpanberger,I began pushing the White House to invoke the Defense Production Act when I started hearing from Virginia parents who were terrified of not being able to find the formula their babies need.Iâ€™m glad to see it is making a differenceðŸ‘‡ 
RepSpanberger,Happy CTE Signing Day Bulldogs!Career &amp; technical education programs give Virginians tangible training and skills to be leaders in our workforce and military.I was happy to celebrate with graduating Goochland High School students today as they move on to their next chapter. 
RepSpanberger,Virginiaâ€™s cattle farmers and beef producers go to work each day to raise their livestock and help put food on the table for families across our Commonwealth and our country.Be sure to thank a farmer this #NationalBeefMonth! ðŸ¥© 
RepSpanberger,Last night @60Minutes showed how prescription drug shortages threaten the health of Americans.I'm working to advance my bipartisan bill to support the researchers and companies who seek to prevent future shortages and increase production here at home.
RepSpanberger,I pressed the White House to invoke the DPA to help contend with the baby formula crisis and these new authorizations will help increase American manufacturing.I look forward to the administration finding additional ways to use this strategy to get formula on the shelves. 
RepSpanberger,We owe an immense debt of gratitude to the men and women who put on the uniform and sacrifice to keep us safe.Today on Armed Forces Day we honor the brave Americans serving our country.Thank you for answering the call. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ 
RepSpanberger,ALL patients should be able to make decisions about their own healthcare without the government breathing down their necks.That includes women seeking abortions.
RepSpanberger,I'm encouraged that the White House is taking some steps to aggressively combat the nationwide baby formula shortage.But I won't be satisfied until formula is on the shelves.And once this crisis is contained I am working to make sure a disaster like this never happens again. 
RepSpanberger,I am proud that my office has returned more than $16 MILLION in backlogged tax refunds federal veterans benefits Social Security checks and more to where that money belongs: Virginiansâ€™ pockets.If you need assistance with a federal agency please be in touch with my office. 
RepSpanberger,Retired Virginia police officer Wally Bunker â€” and thousands of retired officers across the country â€” cannot access a key tax benefit to help pay for his health coverage.Today I shared Wallyâ€™s story and encouraged my colleagues to join me in working to fix this issue. 
RepSpanberger,The White House must use all options to resolve America's baby formula shortage. After pressing them Iâ€™m glad they are invoking the DPA â€” but we can do more. The administration must also prioritize more immediate actions like increasing formula imports.More from @7NewsDC: 
RepSpanberger,ðŸš¨ The White House JUST announced that it will invoke the DPA in response to the national baby formula shortage.Over the last week Iâ€™ve been pressing @WHCOS &amp; @POTUS to take this step and Iâ€™m glad they are listening to the concerns of Virginia parents. 
RepSpanberger,Thank you Senator Tester for using your expertise to shape our bipartisan bill! 
RepSpanberger,My bipartisan TRUST in Congress Act would ban Members of Congress from buying trading or selling individual stocks while in office â€” ensuring that access to inside information cannot be abused for personal gains.
RepSpanberger,ðŸš¨ My bill to crack down on consolidation in the meat processing industry is heading to the House floor!As the big four meat packers rake in record profits this bill would help enforce anti-trust laws and lower grocery costs for families in Virginia and across the country. 
RepSpanberger,When retired Virginia police officer Wally Bunker told my office of a requirement blocking him from accessing a tax benefit for his health coverage we listened.And we are determined to resolve this issue for Wally and thousands of officers nationwide.
RepSpanberger,#HappyBDayHeadStart! Head Start supports thousands of Virginia children.But a recent survey found almost 1 in 3 staff positions are going unfilled.I'm proud to lead a bill to make these positions eligible for Work-Study funding supporting those who support these children. 
RepSpanberger,As Americans face high prices at the grocery store I am proud to work with my Republican colleague @RepAGonzalez on legislation to support our producers combat supply chain challenges and lower food costs for American families.
