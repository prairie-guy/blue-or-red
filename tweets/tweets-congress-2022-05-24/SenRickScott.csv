SenRickScott,Ann &amp; I are heartbroken to hear about the horrific shooting at Robb Elementary School. No student should ever be afraid to go to school. The violence must end. We are praying for all of the victims their families &amp; all affected by this senseless act.
SenRickScott,Under the failed leadership of @DrTedros the @WHO has become a puppet for Communist China &amp; now believes it can force compliance with global health policy.As long as Tedros is in charge the WHO cannot be trusted. 
SenRickScott,Every family in America is paying record-breaking high gas prices thanks to @JoeBiden’s war on American energy - but the president doesn’t care.The only “incredible transition” we want from Joe Biden is his transition to retirement. 
SenRickScott,Communist China has constantly shown that it poses big risks to U.S. companies &amp; investors. With Xi &amp; his communist regime’s increasing aggression against Taiwan &amp; support of Putin’s murderous war against Ukraine it’s time every U.S. investor &amp; company take note &amp; decouple. 
SenRickScott,🚨I’ll be joining @AmericaRpts on @foxnews at 1:00 PM. Tune in! 
SenRickScott,My team is hosting a mobile office hours event today in Oviedo! If you or a family member need help with a federal agency we are here to help.  
SenRickScott,The Chinese Communist Party is guilty of genocide in the Uyghur Homeland. We must decouple from this evil regime. See it for yourself. ⬇️ 
SenRickScott,Congratulations to the @FlaPanthers on a great season! Wishing the best of luck to @TBLightning in the next round. Let’s keep the @StanleyCup in Florida! #GoBolts
SenRickScott,How many other terrorists have crossed our borders due to Joe Biden’s lax policies? It’s time to secure our southern border NOW. What will it take for @JoeBiden to actually take this threat seriously? 
SenRickScott,As Americans struggle to make ends meet thanks to his raging inflation @JoeBiden celebrates their suffering. Biden is incompetent &amp; incoherent but he’s made one thing very clear: he couldn’t care less about the problems he’s caused for your family. 
SenRickScott,Last week I was proud to join a bipartisan group of my colleagues urging the Biden admin to recognize Taiwan as an important trading partner to the U.S. by including it in the proposed IPEF. Failing to do so will go against U.S. economic interests in the region. 
SenRickScott,Good. Any company remaining in Russia only fuels Putin’s murderous war &amp; genocide against Ukraine.Every American company needs to STOP DOING BUSINESS WITH RUSSIA &amp; #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦🇺🇸 
SenRickScott,"🚨ICYMI: America must lead the world in renewing our commitment to ""never again"" &amp; defending human rights freedom &amp; democracy. 🇺🇦🇺🇸#StandWithUkraineRead more in my op-ed for @WashTimesOpEd: "
SenRickScott,I’ve been saying this for years: the @WHO has turned into a puppet for Communist China and cannot be trusted.I’ll be introducing a bill this week to protect American families and taxpayers from the gross overreach of corrupt organizations like the WHO.
SenRickScott,Taiwan is one of America’s most valued &amp; strategic partners in the Asia-Pacific &amp; strengthening our economic ties is in our best interests. If @JoeBiden actually wants to support our democratic ally he’d stop appeasing Communist China &amp; give Taiwan a seat at the table. 
SenRickScott,Twice @POTUS has said America would defend Taiwan if invaded and twice the White House has walked it back.The Senate should take Biden at his word end the confusion and pass my Taiwan Invasion Prevention Act to clearly say that we have Taiwan’s back. 
SenRickScott,It was great to meet with British Ambassador to the United States @KarenPierceUK last week! We discussed the long-standing special relationship between the United States and Britain and continuing our efforts to promote freedom and democracy around the world. 🇬🇧🇺🇸 
SenRickScott,I was proud to meet with Floridians Paul Emily Justin Alastia and Anne last week and hear about the work they do in caring for orthotic and prosthetic patients. Thanks for all that you and @AmericanOandP do! 
SenRickScott,From his raging inflation to his massive supply chain shortages @JoeBiden has proven again &amp; again that he is incapable of solving the problems he’s created for families.Americans deserve better &amp; Republicans are fighting every day to fix it. 
SenRickScott,🚨I’ll be on @FaceTheNation with @margbrennan at 10:35 AM. Tune in! 
SenRickScott,Hardworking Florida families deserve to have their investments under their control &amp; used according to their best interests. I’m proud to join @SenDanSullivan &amp; our colleagues to introduce the INDEX Act to return power back to where it belongs - with individual investors. 
SenRickScott,EE. UU. y nuestro gran aliado Colombia compartimos un fuerte compromiso con la libertad los DD. HH. y la democracia en la región. Es un orgullo reunirme con funcionarios locales y líderes colombianos en Orlando no dejaré de luchar por la libertad y la democracia en LATAM.
SenRickScott,The U.S. &amp; our great ally Colombia share a strong commitment to freedom human rights &amp; democracy across the Western Hemisphere. I was proud to meet w/ local officials &amp; Colombian business leaders in Orlando today &amp; will never stop fighting for freedom &amp; democracy in LATAM. 
SenRickScott,It was great to meet with members of the @alzassociation this week! As a member of @SenateAging I’m proud to be their partner in Washington &amp; grateful for all their efforts to raise awareness for this terrible disease that affects so many families in Florida &amp; across the U.S. 
SenRickScott,.@DiazCanelB &amp; @RaulCastro_Ruz aumentan las torturas contra @jdanielferrer. Quieren silenciar a los líderes de UNPACU y a los valientes cubanos que luchan por la libertad. @JoeBiden debe revertir su detestable apaciguamiento del ilegítimo régimen comunista cubano AHORA. #SOSCuba
SenRickScott,.@DiazCanelB &amp; @RaulCastro_Ruz are increasing torture against @jdanielferrer. They want to silence UNPACU leaders &amp; the brave Cubans fighting for freedom. @JoeBiden must reverse his gross appeasement of the illegitimate communist Cuban regime NOW. #SOSCuba 
SenRickScott,I’m proud to honor our service members today on #ArmedForcesDay. As a Navy veteran &amp; the son of a WWII veteran I understand the sacrifices of those who serve. We owe endless gratitude to the brave men &amp; women in uniform who risk their lives every day to defend our freedoms. 
SenRickScott,Mientras tanto Biden suaviza las sanciones contra el régimen cubano en lugar de unirse con el pueblo cubano en su lucha por libertad y democracia. El repugnante apaciguamiento de Biden está permitiendo este maltrato. #SOSCUBA (2/2)
SenRickScott,Raúl González activista cubano por la democracia y miembro de UNPACU sufre de una grave afección cardíaca y debe ser operado para sobrevivir pero @DiazCanelB y @RaulCastro_Ruz le negaron atención médica por ser parte del movimiento de libertad. (1/2) 
SenRickScott,Drug cartels are pushing fentanyl across our southern border &amp; it’s taking more young lives every day. We had over 100000 drug deaths in the U.S. last year &amp; each one devastates a family.It’s clear that @JoeBiden &amp; @SecMayorkas don’t care. Why won’t they SECURE THE BORDER? 
SenRickScott,Meanwhile Biden softens the sanctions against the Cuban regime instead of fighting with the Cuban people for freedom &amp; democracy. Biden’s disgusting appeasement is enabling this mistreatment. #SOSCUBA (2/2)
SenRickScott,Raul Gonzalez Cuban activist for democracy &amp; member of UNPACU suffers from a serious heart condition &amp; must undergo surgery to live but @DiazCanelB &amp; @RaulCastro_Ruz denied him any medical attention just b/c he belongs to the freedom movement. (1/2) 
SenRickScott,Thank God for good judges. The #BidenBorderCrisis is raging out of control &amp; lifting Title 42 now would be disastrous for our country. It’s time for Biden to get serious &amp; SECURE THE BORDER. 
SenRickScott,El apaciguamiento de @JoeBiden del ilegítimo régimen comunista cubano no solo canalizará toneladas de efectivo al malvado régimen sino que también potenciará la tiranía de Irán y amenazará aún más nuestra seguridad nacional y económica. Biden debe revertir su decisión AHORA.
SenRickScott,.@JoeBiden’s appeasement of the illegitimate communist Cuban regime will not only funnel tons of cash to the evil regime but will prop up Iran’s tyranny &amp; further threaten our national &amp; economic security. Biden must reverse his dangerous decision NOW. 
SenRickScott,Under @JoeBiden’s failed leadership food prices are up 10.8% - the HIGHEST increase in decades. Our poorest families like mine growing up are suffering most. It’s time to fix it. Americans are SICK &amp; TIRED of seeing Biden blame others for the inflation crisis he created. 
SenRickScott,El pueblo cubano ha sufrido por mucho tiempo la horrible opresión y abusos contra los DD. HH. del ilegítimo régimen comunista cubano pero se acerca un nuevo día de libertad. Estoy con los valientes cubanos luchando por libertad democracia y DD. HH. #DíaDeLaIndependenciaDeCuba 
SenRickScott,The Cuban people have long suffered horrific oppression &amp; human rights abuses under the illegitimate communist Cuban regime but a new day of freedom is coming. I will always stand with the brave Cubans fighting for freedom democracy &amp; human rights. #CubaIndependenceDay 
SenRickScott,.@JoeBiden’s radical tax&amp;spend agenda &amp; war on American energy has been a DISASTER for America:❌Raging inflation &amp; rising costs ❌Sky-high gas prices❌Empty shelves of baby formulaBlame-Game Biden is unfit for office &amp; Americans have had ENOUGH 👀🔽 
SenRickScott,Even when I gave @SenateDems a 3RD CHANCE yesterday to help stop reckless gov’t spending if inflation reaches 12% - hurting families with 50% higher costs than we’re seeing now Democrats REFUSED to help. It’s heartless.I won’t stop fighting for Florida families. 👀🔽 
SenRickScott,It was great to be with my friend @JimDeMint &amp; all of @CPInst last night &amp; congratulate them for 5 years of great work to advance conservative policies &amp; fight for American families. I wish CPI many more years of success! 
SenRickScott,🚨ICYMI🚨It took @marcorubio &amp; I to introduce a bill for @JoeBiden to take urgent action to fix the baby formula shortage that was completely AVOIDABLE - just like every one of Biden’s crises. Families are FED UP with Biden’s failures &amp; incompetence. 👀🔽 
SenRickScott,Supporting Israel &amp; promoting democracy must continue to be one of America’s top nat’l security priorities. That’s why I’m urging @SenateApprops Subcommittee on State Foreign Operations &amp; Related Programs to include funding for Israel’s security for FY23. 
SenRickScott,🚨WATCH🚨 I just secured a MAJOR commitment from Biden’s Energy Secretary. @SecGranholm: “The United States will not be importing any oil from Iran or Venezuela.” 👀⬇️ 
SenRickScott,Just left @SASCGOP where I demanded answers from @SecGranholm on skyrocketing gas &amp; diesel prices. Like everyone in @JoeBiden’s admin she just blamed others.Biden created this problem. He needs to own &amp; fix it by restoring U.S. energy independence. 👀⬇️ 
SenRickScott,.@JoeBiden only acted after @marcorubio &amp; I filed a bill to demand it. This was completely avoidable &amp; Biden has failed families AGAIN. There's NO excuse for a baby formula shortage in America. Biden is unfit for the job &amp; Americans are suffering from his incompetence. 
SenRickScott,On behalf of @TheCHLI I was proud to honor my colleague @SenatorTimScott with our Leadership in Public Service Award. He is a fierce advocate for greater opportunity for all Americans &amp; less gov’t. I’m proud to be his partner in the Senate. 
SenRickScott,🚨WATCH🚨 @SenateDems shamelessly defend green lighting reckless deficit spending when @JoeBiden’s raging inflation is already at 8%. Democrats would rather cover for a confused failed president than help families struggling under Biden’s inflation-fueling agenda. 👀🔽 
SenRickScott,.@SenateDems proved again today that they don’t care about American families suffering from @JoeBiden’s record-breaking inflation crisis &amp; skyrocketing prices.Even when inflation is way up Democrats will throw fuel to the fire with more reckless spending. 👀🔽 
SenRickScott,🚨I’ll be on @foxbusiness with @dagenmcdowell at 5:00 PM. Tune in! 
SenRickScott,🚨I’m on the Senate floor to speak about my proposal to combat @JoeBiden and the Democrats’ reckless tax &amp; spend policies and inflation-fueling agenda. Tune in! 
SenRickScott,.@DHSgov’s “disinformation board” is nothing but another dangerous attempt by Democrats to crack down on Americans’ free speech. Biden’s federal thought police is straight out of Orwell’s 1984. It has no place in America &amp; should be shut down permanently. 
SenRickScott,As Biden’s gas price crisis gets worse every day truckers are feeling even more pain at the pump. It’s time for @JoeBiden to put American energy first &amp; ditch his failed radical Green New Deal agenda. 
SenRickScott,Full shelves of baby formula in Guatemala but parents in United States are driving hours &amp; finding nothing.The @WhiteHouse &amp; @US_FDA are not doing enough to keep parents updated. This is an unbelievable crisis hurting babies. @JoeBiden needs to fix it NOW. 
SenRickScott,Looking forward to watching the @FlaPanthers &amp; @TBLightning battle for the Sunshine State &amp; the @StanleyCup!Who are you rooting for? #GoBolts #TimeToHunt
