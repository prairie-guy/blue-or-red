RepBentz,Great point here by my friend from Texas. It seems like we are reminded every single day as to why border security is indeed a matter of national security yet our President - and Congressional Democrats -refuse to implement policies that reflect such thinking. 
RepBentz,Biden’s disastrous open-door immigration policies have led us to the catastrophe we are witnessing at the southern border.His policies have turned every state into a border state. More from me and @SteveScalise ⬇️
RepBentz,A perfect example of @POTUS' failed immigration and border security policies. President Biden's policies have led us to scenes like this one right here. ⬇️ 
RepBentz,Say you drive diesel like many in my district do. You're looking at well over $100 to fill up your pickup in some cases $150. It does 𝗻𝗼𝘁 have to be this way. This administration is deliberately making this situation worse by not unleashing American energy.
RepBentz,Record breaking migrant encounters in April and record breaking gas prices for the ninth day in a row. I always wanted a President that brought about change but this sure isn’t the change I had in mind.
