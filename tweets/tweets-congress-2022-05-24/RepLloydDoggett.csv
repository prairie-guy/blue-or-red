RepLloydDoggett,No words can capture the pain of the loss of these fourteen young lives and their teacher in Robb Elementary School. Our hearts break. What must also break is the gun lobby‚Äôs control over some in Congress.
RepLloydDoggett,Whichever runoff you participate in our democracy is stronger when we all participate. Polls are open today until 7 PM‚Äîand @KUT has a guide to all you need to know:  
RepLloydDoggett,I‚Äôm pressing for more action faster from TSA to ensure travelers at the Austin airport are not stuck in long lines. From @KVUE: 
RepLloydDoggett,There‚Äôs an election underway! If you haven‚Äôt voted yet in the Democratic or Republican runoff election TODAY is the only day to vote.üó≥Ô∏èPolls are open now until 7 PM.‚¨áÔ∏èHead to the polls to make your voice heard: 
RepLloydDoggett,üö®Where have all the voters gone?üö®‚ÄúThe combined early voting turnout between the Republican and Democratic primary runoffs sat at 3.2 %.‚Äù
RepLloydDoggett,This takes real courage‚Äîto speak the plain and ugly truth while under Putin‚Äôs regime. May others abroad and here be inspired by this brave example to denounce those who seek power through violence.   
RepLloydDoggett,This is the Lone Star state but we do not stand alone. Across the country we're joined by fellow Americans standing up against these attacks on reproductive rights.Greater engagement by all of us every day can push back on backwards judges and politicians.#BansOffOurBodies 
RepLloydDoggett,Visited with TX autoworkers led by Jimmy Mack about ending monopoly prices for prescription drugs building a fairer tax system &amp; importance of ensuring workers engaged in manufacturing gasoline-powered vehicles aren't left behind in the important transition to electric vehicles. 
RepLloydDoggett,While this @nytimes article highlights some individual actions businesses are taking there is no substitute for nationwide reform and expansion of child care access.
RepLloydDoggett,America‚Äôs child care affordability and access crisis harms children and parents‚Äîespecially mothers. This holds back families and this holds back our economy.
RepLloydDoggett,The Erdogan regime in Turkey needs a major upgrade of its respect for human rights and freedom of the press‚Äînot an upgrade of military hardware. More weapons from America should be off the table. No blank checks on more arms for authoritarians.
RepLloydDoggett,A wonderful partnership between @AustinHabitat and @AustinISD.¬†I commend Habitat for their dedication to building affordable housing‚Äîa critical need in our community‚Äîand for their investment in our AISD families. 
RepLloydDoggett,Infants cannot wait to get the formula they need amidst this shortage. A shocking 192 colleagues many of them who support forcing people to give birth voted against one of our bills helping infants now.
RepLloydDoggett,Happy National Bike to Work Day üö≤! My advisor Mark joined other cyclist staffers as he commutes to my DC office. Proud to support those who choose to burn calories instead of carbon. More must be done to make bicycling a safe and affordable form of transportation #B2WD2022 
RepLloydDoggett,Ensuring individuals obtain the skills needed for a rewarding life must not be a privilege reserved for the wealthy few. 
RepLloydDoggett,57 years ago President Johnson said ‚Äúmore can and must be done‚Äù to support those in need; Head Start was created. Though we have so much more to accomplish millions of families across Texas and our Nation are far better off through Head Start‚Äôs efforts.
RepLloydDoggett,@JulieOliverTX We have to overcome the deniers and cynics we have to win over more neighbors to the urgency for action and we have to work together on our shared goals.¬†I certainly welcome your participation and ideas.
RepLloydDoggett,@JulieOliverTX Meanwhile our Progressive Caucus is urging the Administration to use its authority to the maximum extent possible and declare a climate emergency. I continue to join our local leaders at the Sierra Club Windsor Park Climate Committee and others to speak out and demand action.
RepLloydDoggett,@JulieOliverTX But as long as one woman Kyrsten Sinema and one man Joe Manchin permit the GOP blockade and refuse to end the filibuster neither these efforts nor protecting reproductive freedom‚Äînor much more‚Äîcan become law.
RepLloydDoggett,@JulieOliverTX You‚Äôre right about Ways &amp; Means‚Äîand that‚Äôs why last September with my active participation we approved an extensive package of incentives for renewables going electric more energy efficiency and new green jobs.
RepLloydDoggett,Wonderful discussion with Austinite Vienna a 14-year-old star who gives me hope for the future‚Äîand who had one of the best speeches at the #BansOffOurBodies event on Saturday. 
RepLloydDoggett,THANK YOU Austin!! Humbled and honored to receive this Best of Austin award for the 13th time from @AustinChronicle readers‚Äîthis vote of confidence from neighbors wouldn't be possible if not for the commitment of my staff local leaders and so many determined community members. 
RepLloydDoggett,Early voting is underway right now through Friday and polls are open every day 7 AM to 7 PM. Whether voting in the Democratic or Republican runoff elections have you made your plan yet to make your voice heard?üìç Find your polling location:
RepLloydDoggett,Productive meeting with Czech senators and the Czech Ambassador @hynekkmonicek to discuss our mutual interests supporting Ukraine and weaning our countries from fossil fuels‚Äînot just to combat the climate crisis but also as a part of our national security. 
RepLloydDoggett,One million lives lost‚Äîno words to describe this tragedy. @CNN looks at how disinformation and public health wrongs kill:
