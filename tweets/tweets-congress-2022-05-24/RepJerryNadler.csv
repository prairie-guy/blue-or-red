RepJerryNadler,After 2 years of the pandemic it’s good to be back with so many friends at the Annual Legislative Breakfast of @Met_Council. Met Council serves over 300k New Yorkers annually who are in need. 
RepJerryNadler,Great meeting with Special Envoy Deborah Lipstadt @StateSEAS yesterday. We are fortunate to have her leading the fight against rising antisemitism and the dangerous threats facing the Jewish communities across the globe. 
RepJerryNadler,ICYMI 
RepJerryNadler,As families are struggling to find formula for their children the @HouseGOP voted against a critical bill that will not only make formula cheaper but more accessible. The party that claims to be “pro-family” once again has voted against the interests of American families.
RepJerryNadler,Today @HouseDemocrats passed the long overdue Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act greatly enhancing the federal government’s efforts to combat violent extremism and helping to keep families and communities safe. 
RepJerryNadler,This bill which the House will consider today is the least we can do to signal our opposition to white nationalism and this rising menace of organized intolerance.A special thanks to @RepSchneider for his tremendous work introducing this bill. 
RepJerryNadler,Domestic terrorism is a serious and well-documented problem facing our country. H.R. 350 the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act is a bipartisan solution to this growing threat.

RepJerryNadler,In so doing it would revoke the constitutional right to abortion—a fundamental right it first recognized almost 50 years ago in Roe v. Wade and one that millions of Americans have relied on for half a century. (3/5)
RepJerryNadler,Two weeks ago in an unprecedented leak of a draft opinion from the Supreme Court we learned that—for the first time in its history—the Court may be on the precipice of overturning precedent to take away a constitutional right. (2/5)
RepJerryNadler,"RIGHT NOW: @housejudiciary is holding a hearing ""Revoking Your Rights: The Ongoing Crisis in Abortion Care Access"" to examine the existential threats to the constitutional right to abortion. (1/5) "
