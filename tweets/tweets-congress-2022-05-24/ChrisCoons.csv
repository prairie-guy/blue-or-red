ChrisCoons,In Brussels this weekend I met with @NATO leadership. The alliance is stronger than it’s been in decades and will only get stronger with the accession of Finland and Sweden. We must maintain our commitment to Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s invasion. 
ChrisCoons,This weekend I stopped at the Russian War Crimes House in Davos and took in the horrific images and details of war crimes committed by Russian troops against Ukrainians. It's impossible to hear these stories and not be moved to action in support of the Ukrainian cause. 
ChrisCoons,When my late friend and colleague John McCain was banned from travel to Russia he said ‘I couldn’t be more proud.’Well John I couldn’t be more proud to join you on the list. Glad my efforts to support the Ukrainian people have been noticed in Moscow:  
ChrisCoons,The US has the resources expertise and vision to be a global leader in carbon removal technology. Glad to see the @WhiteHouse taking important steps to meet the moment. 
ChrisCoons,Building on the investment in CO2 removal technology in the #BipartisanInfrastructureLaw I intro'd a bill last week to create a market for removing CO2 and meet our climate goals. Thanks to @RepScottPeters @SenWhitehouse and @RepPaulTonko for partnering on this issue.
ChrisCoons,"""Across the world across dozens of cultures millions and millions of people want to have a hand in determining their future. Democracy is the best form of government... if we're going to have any hope of addressing existential challenges like climate change."""
ChrisCoons,"""Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine is going to cause a lot of folks to reevaluate whether freedom is worth fighting for and whether freedom must be fought for. Ultimately I believe they will conclude that it's worth the fight."""
ChrisCoons,"""You could have made the case that an an authoritarian state was faster at delivering a response to development... I don't think you can make the argument that they delivered a  better response to the pandemic.. or with response to climate change."""
ChrisCoons,"""The single most important thing we can do to advance democracy globally is to advance democracy domestically. The single most important thing we can do to advance democracy domestically is to actually solve problems."""
ChrisCoons,Starting now: I'm speaking on a panel on 'The Future of Democracy' at @wef. Tune in here ▶️

ChrisCoons,The Russian blockade of the port of Odessa is causing a crisis for countries that rely on Ukraine as the Breadbasket of Europe. I talked to @GarrettHaake about why the $5B in global hunger relief I fought to secure in the funding package passed by Congress is so crucial. 
ChrisCoons,"""If Putin's critical goal in invading Ukraine was to prevent the expansion of NATO he has failed."" "
ChrisCoons,@JudiciaryDems @ChuckGrassley Last but not least I was happy to support the Strong Communities Act that encourages departments to recruit officers who will live in the communities they serve. Officers who live in their precincts know them better and serve them better. #NationalPoliceWeek
ChrisCoons,@JudiciaryDems @ChuckGrassley I supported the Law Enforcement De-Escalation Training Act because it will help officers better respond to situations involving mental and behavioral issues. When officers are better prepared to handle these crises they keep their communities safer and respond more effectively.
ChrisCoons,@JudiciaryDems @ChuckGrassley Smaller law enforcement departments that struggle to get grants also struggle to recruit and retain officers or trainings that keep their community safer. That’s why I supported the Invest to Protect Act which will ensure smaller agencies can get a fair share of federal funds.
ChrisCoons,@JudiciaryDems My bill which I introduced with my colleague @ChuckGrassley will help recognize treat and prevent PTSD among officers. Many of our Finest live with the toll that comes with putting their lives on the line each day. We need to look after their physical and their mental health.
ChrisCoons,Yesterday I joined my @JudiciaryDems colleagues to advance important legislation to support law enforcement including my bill to help fight PTSD among law enforcement. Nobody should suffer alone and I'm glad these efforts have bipartisan support during #NationalPoliceWeek.
ChrisCoons,The men and women who protect and serve our neighborhoods in Delaware and across the country deserve our thanks and our support. Glad to join my colleagues in unanimously adopting a resolution to commemorate #NationalPoliceWeek.
ChrisCoons,Read my full statement about the Senate's passage of our emergency spending bill to aid Ukraine here ☞
ChrisCoons,Today the United States has sent a clear message that we will continue to stand with Ukraine against tyranny and in defense of the rule of law by sending them an additional $39 billion in military economic and humanitarian aid -- but we still have more work to do.
ChrisCoons,Congratulations to @NatlHeadStart on 57 years of changing the lives of young Americans! Head Start helps kids develop language cognitive and literacy skills at an early age – that’s why I’m proud to support efforts to fully fund it each year. 
ChrisCoons,I'm glad Abbott and the @FDA have worked out a deal to speed up production of baby formula but we never should have reached this point. Congress must now work to understand the failures that led us here so that we can prevent families from struggling with this in the future. 
ChrisCoons,As co-founder of the Senate ALS Caucus I know that increasing awareness for this debilitating disease moves us closer to a cure. This week the Senate adopted my resolution designating May as ALS Awareness Month – an important sign of support for patients and their loved ones.
