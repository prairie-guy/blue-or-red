RepRonKind,This is absolutely heartbreaking news. Please join me in praying for the children families and teachers affected by this horrific act of violence at Robb Elementary and the entire Uvalde community tonight. 
RepRonKind,Itâ€™s Armed Forces Day. Today and every day we honor the brave men and women who have answered the call to serve.Â While we can never repay the debt we owe weâ€™re forever grateful to our service members. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ 
RepRonKind,Since the founding of our nation we're at our best when we work together. That's why I'm proud to be named one of the most bipartisan members of Congress by the nonpartisan Lugar Center. Great to talk with @JohnMercure about this recognition and more - thanks for having me! 
RepRonKind,I voted to pass a bipartisan relief package last week to provide Ukraine with urgent humanitarian economic &amp; military aid as they continue to fight off Putin's brutal attack. Glad to see the Senate follow suit &amp; deliver this bill to @POTUS' desk. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

RepRonKind,Happy Birthday @NatlHeadStart. Since 1965 #HeadStart has provided critical support to families and changed the lives of more than 37 million children nationwide. Thanks for all you do! 
RepRonKind,The @NewDemCoalition turns 2âƒ£5âƒ£ this year! As a past Chair I'm proud to be a #NewDem and work with my colleagues to find common ground and tackle the challenges facing workers and families across the nation.
