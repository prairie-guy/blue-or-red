RepMikeCarey,I’ll be joining @GOPLeader @RepBalderson and @OhioAG soon. Watch live! 
RepMikeCarey,Biden has gone from blaming record gas prices on everyone but himself to calling the energy crisis an “incredible transition.”There is nothing incredible about the pain his failed policies are inflicting on the American people.
RepMikeCarey,Despite what the Biden Administration claims out of control spending has driven U.S. inflation higher than other nations. 
RepMikeCarey,Trying the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Let’s try unleashing American energy independence instead! 
RepMikeCarey,Reducing pain at the pump has never been a priority for the Biden Administration.Their Green New Deal agenda will only make things more painful for American families &amp; workers. 
RepMikeCarey,The Biden Administration’s attempt to end Title 42 was reckless and would have made our historic border crisis even worse.The court made the right decision! 
RepMikeCarey,Thank you for the meeting. It was great to learn more about the important work you are doing. 
RepMikeCarey,"Biden: ""I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump.""Reality: Anti-energy policies continue to drive record high gas prices with no end in sight. "
