RepSherrill,I am more concerned about thoughtfully addressing this unacceptable level of violence than pandering to NRA extremism. And if you care about our children you need to hold your elected representatives accountable.
RepSherrill,I can‚Äôt tell you the number of votes I‚Äôve taken to enact gun safety legislation because I care about our children I care about our vets I care about victims of domestic violence and I care about people with mental health issues.
RepSherrill,We are living under a tyranny of the minority: extremists who fail to pass laws that provide even the most basic of protections.
RepSherrill,The news of Robb Elementary School &amp; the 14 young children &amp; the teacher who died has made me increasingly furious at people in this country that continue to elect representatives who 1) refuse to address this horrible level of gun violence &amp; 2) put all of our children in danger.
