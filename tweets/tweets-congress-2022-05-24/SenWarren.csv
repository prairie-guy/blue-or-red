SenWarren,My bill was signed into law last year to rename military assets that celebrate traitors who took up arms against the United States to defend slavery.These recommendations are a significant step to reckon with our past end decades of injustice and honor American heroes. 
SenWarren,If Republicans achieve their goal of overturning #RoeVWade women across this country will bear the consequences.This is a five-alarm fire and we need to use every tool possible to protect the right to safe and legal abortions.
SenWarren,Workers at Maximus call centers do critically important work to ensure millions of Americans can access their healthcare. I stand with these workers in their fight for better pay affordable healthcare and a union and I'm in this fight with you all the way. 
SenWarren,Private equity giant @KKR_Co bought up dozens of group homes for people with disabilities — then made big money providing grossly substandard care and risking patient safety. My colleagues and I are calling for answers on these disturbing practices.
SenWarren,We should cap insulin costs at $35 a month and lower the price of prescription drugs for all Americans. Let’s do this.
SenWarren,Congratulations to @PPFA workers across Massachusetts who will vote to unionize! A union will ensure these workers are empowered to do their critical work of providing safe abortions and other reproductive health care services to women across the Commonwealth. 
SenWarren,Nearly 9 million federal loan borrowers are 50 years of age and older. With a stroke of his pen @POTUS can #CancelStudentDebt and bring relief to millions of Americans.
SenWarren,The American people support canceling student debt even those who don’t have loans. One of the reasons? There's scarcely a working person in America who doesn't have a friend family member or coworker weighed down by this burden. @POTUS should #CancelStudentDebt.
SenWarren,Justice Thomas refused to recuse himself from cases involving the 2020 election while his wife was leading efforts to overturn it.I’ve got a plan to root out these corrupt practices by Supreme Court Justices and fix our broken judicial ethics system.
SenWarren,"Over and over @Wellsfargo gets caught cheating. And this time they've been caught giving fake job interviews to candidates to ""boost diversity efforts on paper"" —even though they had already given the job to someone else. This bank needs to be broken up."
SenWarren,Four corporations control 85% of the beef market—they're using their market power to raise prices to pad their bottom line. @SenatorRounds and I have a new resolution to direct the @FTC to investigate antitrust violations in the beef packing industry.
SenWarren,.@linakhanFTC is right: unchecked market concentration contributes to the baby formula shortage &amp; the high prices Americans are paying for meat. I've got a plan to crack down on monopolies and create competition in our markets to lower costs.
SenWarren,Private equity has been buying up everything from homes to hospitals — hurting families and workers and potentially breaking U.S. laws. @JusticeATR is right to enforce our antitrust laws to promote competitive markets and lower consumer prices.
SenWarren,A Trump appointee (whose boss tried to overturn an election) staged her own coup to try and override President Biden’s FDIC majority to protect big banks from oversight. Rs still defend her like they defend Trump. But it was illegal and she resigned in disgrace. 
SenWarren,If Roe is overturned the consequences of this decision will fall hardest on low-income women and women of color but make no mistake—every American will feel the impact. This is a five-alarm fire and Democrats need to use every tool possible to protect the right to choose. 
SenWarren,Big corporations are jacking up prices lining shareholder pockets and making inflation worse. But while American families are hurting CEOs are getting huge raises.
SenWarren,I’ve been fighting to enhance transparency &amp; I’m glad more Pentagon officials understand our moral &amp; strategic imperative to prevent civilian casualties. But we must do more. It's critical that this year's annual defense bill include my bills.
SenWarren,I'll be reviewing the Pentagon’s report carefully. Investigations must be independent and comprehensive including interviewing witnesses on the ground. I recently reintroduced a bill to prevent future civilian harm &amp; hold leaders accountable when failing to follow laws of war.
SenWarren,The 2019 US airstrike in Syria is among the most devastating instance of civilian harm. We need accountability &amp; transparency—and that's why I called for an investigation into this strike. We can't continue accepting civilian death &amp; harm as a cost of war.
SenWarren,The shortage of baby formula today is due in part to a lack of competition.While Abbott raked in massive profits in this highly consolidated industry their execs ignored safety warnings and gave away billions to investors.@SenBooker &amp; I want answers.
SenWarren,Democrats need to use every tool possible to protect a woman's right to choose. With an extremist Supreme Court poised to overturn Roe I’m calling out data brokers for their disturbing practice of selling location data of women visiting abortion clinics.
SenWarren,The majority of student loans are held by those with no household wealth. That’s not surprising. It’s the reason why they had to borrow money in the first place to try and advance their education. @POTUS should #CancelStudentDebt to help millions of hardworking Americans.
