RepGregoryMeeks,The court’s decision to block the end of Title 42 is disappointing. I applaud @POTUS’ decision to appeal the decision and ensure this Trump-era rule comes to an end. 
RepGregoryMeeks,Today I joined @SpeakerPelosi my colleagues in the @TheBlackCaucus @CAPAC and @HispanicCaucus to condemn this past weekend's shooting in Buffalo. White supremacy is a threat to our democracy and we must do everything we can to stop these acts of hatred. 
RepGregoryMeeks,It’s important to prioritize your mental health. During #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth remember that you do not deserve to suffer in silence. Let's bring awareness to the importance of mental health ending the stigma and seeking support.
RepGregoryMeeks,Congrats @StJohnsU for officially breaking ground! I'm proud to have secured $1.25M in funding to contribute to the new facility which will strengthen the learning environment for a new nursing program.
