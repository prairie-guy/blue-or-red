HerreraBeutler,Southwest Washington residents: I’m hosting a live teletown hall on Wednesday June 1st @ 5:30PM where I’ll be providing an update from Congress and answering your questions. 
HerreraBeutler,Today is #ArmedForcesDay. Please join me in thanking the men and women serving in our U.S. Armed Forces who keep us safe and defend the freedom we enjoy. 
HerreraBeutler,I’d like to know – if you were old enough to remember the blast – where were you and what do you remember from that day? ⬇️
HerreraBeutler,Today marks 42 years (hard to believe that many years have passed!) since Mount St. Helens blew its top. It tragically killed 57 people and forever altered the surrounding landscape. Our communities still feel the mighty impact of that historic eruption even to this day.
