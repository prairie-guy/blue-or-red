RepCleaver,I have been blessed with incredible interns over the years and it’s always exciting to see what they accomplish after their internship ends.Congratulations to former intern (but always #TeamCleaver!) Shera Bhala on receiving a Fullbright fellowship!
RepCleaver,Black mothers are 3x as likely to die from childbirth than their white counterparts. That’s unacceptable—and @POTUS @VP and the @BMHCaucus are taking action to address these disparities and improve maternal health across the country. 
RepCleaver,While my Republican colleagues in Congress are blocking legislation that would provide funding to more quickly get safe baby formula back on shelves @POTUS and the Biden Administration are working tirelessly to #FeedOurInfants with Operation Fly Formula.

RepCleaver,The impact of Putin’s despicable invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated the desperate need to end our reliance on volatile fossil fuels. We need to accelerate our transition to an independent sustainable energy efficient economy. I’ll keep fighting to do just that. 
RepCleaver,“It is by any account the most significant international economic engagement that the United States has ever had in this region.” Good to see @POTUS continuing to demonstrate American leadership and strengthen economic ties on the global stage.

RepCleaver,2 companies control 80% of U.S. baby formula production. This kind of market consolidation leaves us vulnerable to shortages if one factory fails to uphold safety standards—and American families are the ones who feel the pain. Proud to join @Ilhan’s call for more competition. 
RepCleaver,Following the tragedy in Buffalo it is clear and critical that Congress do more to combat domestic terrorism. @HouseDemocrats took action this week to bolster federal resources dedicated to preventing these hate-fueled attacks.

RepCleaver,Last night @HouseDemocrats and I voted for critical legislation to get baby formula back on shelves #FeedOurInfants and ensure a shortage never happens again. 192 of my GOP colleagues voted to keep shelves empty. 
RepCleaver,From replacing harmful lead pipes to expanding public transportation and shortening commute times the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is already making an impact in communities across the country!
RepCleaver,No parent should ever have to wonder how or when they will be able to feed their child. Until this unacceptable shortage is addressed I will continue working with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to #FeedOurInfants!
RepCleaver,Additionally we’re passing a bill I cosponsored that would provide low-income families the flexibility needed to get other safe formula products with WIC benefits—which account for roughly 50% of formula sales nationwide.
RepCleaver,First we’re voting for a bill that would provide emergency funding to ensure the FDA has the resources necessary to get formula on grocery store shelves end the shortage and do it in a way that guarantees infant formula meets health and safety standards.
