RepAnthonyBrown,Children should be safe in school.We grieve for the 14 kids and one teacher whose lives were cut tragically short.We have to muster the courage to do something to stop this from happening again and again and again.We have to end this cycle. 
RepAnthonyBrown,This is about more than symbolism. Who our military chooses to honor sets a path forward for other necessary reforms to make our armed services more inclusive diverse and just. Today’s announcement is another step forward in this effort. It’s long past time to see this change.

RepAnthonyBrown,In MD we banned assault weapons and that’s the model we need nationwide.Absent that we need to #RaiseTheAge to purchase these weapons to ensure they don’t get into the hands of young people.This simple change could’ve saved lives in #Buffalo. I joined @TheRevAl to discuss. 
RepAnthonyBrown,🗣 Be Clear 🗣I don’t believe that any American civilian regardless of age should be allowed to purchase assault weapons. Period. Full stop. 
RepAnthonyBrown,Looking forward to joining @TheRevAl and @PoliticsNation soon to discuss the way forward to tackle hate crimes and gun violence. Join us.
RepAnthonyBrown,@MJMusicEars @DNC Thank is a fantastic idea! Thank you for sounding off.—ACW 
RepAnthonyBrown,Biking especially for our short trips is made easier by the Bipartisan #InfrastructureLaw. It provides $12B for people walking biking and rolling. This #BikeToWorkDay we're celebrating our progress on making biking accessible for all. 
RepAnthonyBrown,Cars trucks and SUVs make up 60% of trips one (1) mile or less. That’s a lot of CO2 😯Today is #BikeToWorkDay and participating in events like this is an example of common-sense #ClimateAction.

RepAnthonyBrown,That’s why I and @HouseDemocrats voted ✅YES for a bill that will:🍼 Provide the @US_FDA with the resources it needs to address this shortage.🍼  Improve WIC participants’ access to formula products and ensure they are not left behind.

RepAnthonyBrown,Yesterday I went on @Morning_Joe  to discuss the crisis of gun violence in this country. If Congress is going to prevent tragedies like the attack in #Buffalo from occurring again they should pass common sense reforms like the Raise the Age Act &amp; expanding background checks. 
RepAnthonyBrown,Yesterday the House took decisive action to tackle white supremacy head on by passing the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act. In the wake of the horrific terror attack in Buffalo we need to get serious about tackling this threat.
