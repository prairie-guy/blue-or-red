SenTinaSmith,Just an incredible speech by my colleague @ChrisMurphyCT. 
SenTinaSmith,Horrific news. No words. The blockade of gun safety bills has caused an untold number of unnecessary deaths in this country.
SenTinaSmith,Thanks for listening.
SenTinaSmith,There’s no magic cure for depression and no one bill will fix everything.But we can make progress and help more people get help and support and that’s what matters.
SenTinaSmith,I have several bills that would make a big difference. I'll share more details very soon but the big theme is access. When I was ready to get help for my depression I had resources. That’s not true for everyone and we need to change that.
SenTinaSmith,Last year when I shared this story we were at a different place with mental health in the Senate. But the conversation has advanced. There are now two committees that are actively working in a bipartisan way to pass mental health legislation.
SenTinaSmith,I share this because 1) I want to let people know they are not alone. We can all work to break the stigma around talking about this. And 2) I'm a U.S. Senator and I'm using my position to make positive change.
SenTinaSmith,"When I was a young mom in my 30s I struggled again. I remember my heart breaking when our son said ""Mom are you OK?""I got help sooner this time and I with treatment and care got better."
SenTinaSmith,My roommate tried to talk to me about it but I was in denial. Eventually I realized I needed help and went to see a counselor. That experience changed my life. Happier IS possible.
SenTinaSmith,I've experienced depression twice in my life.The first time I was in college.  At first I thought it was just a rough patch. As time went on it became harder to cope.
SenTinaSmith,Millions of Americans struggle with their mental health.I’m a U.S. Senator. And I’ve struggled with depression. Because it’s mental health awareness month I’m sharing my story here.
SenTinaSmith,I don't think we paused enough to acknowledge one million American deaths from COVID. It didn't have to be this way. What an unimaginable loss.
SenTinaSmith,All Americans deserve equal protection under the law. I’m a proud supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment. We need the #ERANow.
