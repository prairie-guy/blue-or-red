MazieHirono,I'm horrified and heartbroken for the Uvalde community and our nation.It's been nearly 10 years since Sandy Hook and still our children are getting gunned down in our schools.What is it going to take for Republicans to find the basic decency to help us end this nightmare?
MazieHirono,Despite APIAs' many contributions to our country our communities have largely been excluded from American history.  A National Museum of APIA History &amp; Culture would share our stories on an unprecedented scale and we are now one step closer to making such a museum a reality. 
MazieHirono,Telesforo De La Cruz Trinidad is the only Filipino in the U.S. Navy to have ever been awarded the Medal of Honor. Last year I wrote to @SECNAV encouraging the Navy to name a ship in his honor and I'm glad to see them heeding that call.
MazieHirono,No parent should have to worry about how to keep their baby fed. I'm glad to see @POTUS treating the formula crisis with the urgency it demands and am encouraged by this news. This is an important step but we’ll keep fighting to make sure this never happens again. 
MazieHirono,No parent should have to worry about whether they can find the formula their baby needs. That's why I joined @PattyMurray in calling on @POTUS to appoint a White House Coordinator in charge of ending this crisis and getting formula back on shelves. 
MazieHirono,As working families struggle to afford high gas prices from Putin’s war and the Covid recovery oil &amp; gas companies are focused on rewarding their executives and wealthy shareholders rather than investing in production to lower prices. They must be held accountable. 
MazieHirono,Researchers at @UHawaiiNews &amp; @Chaminade_Univ are doing exciting work using data to combat climate change. With a $20 million @NSF grant they'll be able to invest in more groundbreaking research to better understand climate change &amp; protect our planet.
MazieHirono,One year ago today @POTUS signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law. Today we must reaffirm our commitment to combatting the discrimination prejudice &amp; racism that communities of color the LGBTQ+ community women and more continue to face.
MazieHirono,Thank you @RepGraceMeng for your leadership! 
MazieHirono,I joined Asian &amp; Pacific Islander American leaders at the Capitol to celebrate #APAHeritageMonth and discuss our ongoing efforts to eradicate anti-Asian hate. We also chatted about the exciting possibility of a National Museum of APA History &amp; Culture. 
MazieHirono,Parents across Hawaii: keiki ages 5-11 are now eligible to get a booster. It’s up to all of us to end this pandemic. So please protect your keiki yourself and your community and get your kids vaccinated and boosted. 
MazieHirono,Women in our country are going to wake up one morning soon &amp; realize they no longer control their own bodies.This is about who gets to decide what we do with our bodies—women or government?@SenateDems are fighting to protect women's fundamental right to control our bodies. 
MazieHirono,I’m glad the Senate passed much-needed aid for the people of Ukraine. But it shouldn’t have taken this long. Republicans need to stop playing politics with what should be an unwavering commitment to help Ukraine fight back against Putin’s reckless and inhumane war.
MazieHirono,I just went to the Senate floor to pass a bill to establish a commission to study the creation of a National Museum of #APA History and Culture.Thank you @RepGraceMeng for your leadership on this issue.This bill now heads to @POTUS's desk.
MazieHirono,Joining my Senate Democratic women colleagues to discuss our fight for abortion rights and reproductive freedom.Tune in: 
MazieHirono,My bill to name the ALOHA VA Clinic after the late Senator Daniel Kahikina Akaka is on its way to @POTUS's desk to be signed into law. The facility spearheaded by Sen. Akaka will serve thousands &amp; honor his legacy of service to Hawaii &amp; our veterans.
MazieHirono,It was great to join my friends @SenDuckworth and @VP Harris and AANHPI leaders at the White House to celebrate APA Heritage Month. I'm grateful for their partnership as we work to strengthen AANHPI communities in Hawaii and across our country. 
MazieHirono,Amid a disturbing assault on LGBTQ+ rights today and every day I stand with LGBTQ+ people everywhere. On International Day Against Homophobia Biphobia and Transphobia I call on all of us to reaffirm that hatred of any kind has no place in our society.#IDAHOBIT2022
