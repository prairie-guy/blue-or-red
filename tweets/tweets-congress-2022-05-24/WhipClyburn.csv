WhipClyburn,I'm not giving up on this country.Every democracy has its own challenges and ours is no different.But we must come together as Americans — Democrats and Republicans Black and white rich and poor — to keep this pursuit of a more perfect union going. 
WhipClyburn,I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration for their efforts to get baby formula back on shelves across the country. Operation Fly Formula just delivered more than 70000 pounds of specialty formula to the U.S. and a second flight is scheduled for later this week.
WhipClyburn,Today I had the distinct honor of accepting an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters during the 321st commencement ceremony at @Yale University.It was a privilege to share a stage with such bright and distinguished graduates.Congratulations and best of luck in your next chapter. 
WhipClyburn,In just 6 months the bipartisan infrastructure bill has delivered over $1.3 billion in funds to South Carolina.This once-in-a-generation investment in our roads bridges public transportation and broadband will bring our rural communities into the 21st century. 
WhipClyburn,This week nearly all House R's voted against legislation to:- Crack down on gas price gouging- Provide funds to address the baby formula shortage- Curb white supremacy and domestic terrorism@HouseDemocrats are working for the American people. Who is @HouseGOP working for?
WhipClyburn,Today @HouseDemocrats joined together to denounce the white supremacist violence in our communities and honor the memories of those lost in Buffalo NY. The tragedy in Buffalo echoes the 2015 shooting at Mother Emanuel AME Church. Hatred is destructive and we must combat it. 
WhipClyburn,How well do you know the history of Brown v. Board of Education?In honor of its 68th anniversary I sat down with SC Judge Richard Gergel for a conversation on the landmark decision and the surprising role our Palmetto state played.
WhipClyburn,House Democrats have been working closely with the Biden-Harris Admin to solve the infant formula shortage.Tonight the House passed legislation to provide the FDA with emergency funding to address the shortage and to improve access to formula for low-income Americans.
WhipClyburn,We cannot allow our country to turn a blind eye to white supremacist vigilantes. Their hatred impacts all of us. The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act will give federal agencies the tools they need to ensure peace and justice prevail. 
WhipClyburn,My bill just passed the House that expands my anti-poverty targeted funding approach throughout the federal gov’t.We’ve made significant progress since LBJ declared war on poverty.Let's take this next step to help communities that've been left behind.
WhipClyburn,As a former teacher I'm grateful for the unparalleled educational resources @HeadStartgov has given our students over the last 57 years.Thank you for your efforts to make education more equitable and accessible for all. #HappyBdayHeadStart 
WhipClyburn,The infant formula shortage currently facing our nation is at a crisis point.Today @HouseDemocrats are voting on two pieces of legislation to get the FDA resources it needs to address the shortage and expand WIC participants' access to formula. #FeedOurInfants
WhipClyburn,From driving tech advances to playing a key role in the ACA passage the @NewDemCoalition has gotten things done for 25 years.They are a stalwart example of how to develop and implement public policy.As a founding member I'm honored to help celebrate this milestone.
WhipClyburn,On this 68th anniversary of Brown v. Board let us remember this: anything that has happened before can happen again.We must preserve our history.My bill which is now law will do just that by expanding the historic sites associated with the landmark ruling.
