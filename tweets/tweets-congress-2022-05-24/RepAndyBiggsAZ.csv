RepAndyBiggsAZ,Thank you to the experts from @azwater @CAPArizona @PinalCounty and @AZFB for joining me for a roundtable on water policy. I'm grateful for their insight as we discussed innovative solutions to ensure Arizona’s water supply is plentiful for decades to come. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,The FBI reports an ISIS operative was hoping to smuggle four Iraqi men via the southern border to take out President Bush. This is why border security matters. In many cases we have no idea who is coming into our country under Biden’s policies. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,In Japan President Biden said his record-high gas prices are part of an “incredible transition” that will make America and the world better off. Biden is completely out of touch with everyday Americans.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,WATCH:While touring the Yuma border sector today I witnessed firsthand the horrible environmental damage created by Biden’s Border crisis. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,I’m in the Yuma Sector and illegal alien groups–mostly comprised of single adult men-are overwhelming Border Patrol.Take a look: 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,America needs a new leader. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,My congressional colleagues are sending billions of dollars and resources to secure borders far away from America. Let’s secure our own border before anything else.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,The border crisis we are witnessing is due to the Biden Administration violating the law instead of doing their constitutional obligation to enforce the law. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Today is National Armed Forces Day. I thank all of the courageous men and women who protect our nation and make us all safer. Thank you for your service.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,These folks don’t respect our sovereignty and the rule of law. We need to build the wall fully reimplement the Remain in Mexico program and impeach DHS Secretary Mayorkas. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,A federal judge just ruled to keep Title 42 in place for now. This is a major win for Arizona and the entire nation but there is still much left to do. We must continue to hold the Biden regime accountable for its reckless decision making. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,The Biden Administration knows the consequences of ending Title 42 will be catastrophic. They think the suffering caused by the border crisis is worth it to implement their open border agenda. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Best of luck Stephanie. It's been a pleasure going on your show. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,No surprise here. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Biden's DHS has released nearly 1 million illegal aliens into the country in violation of the law.  It is only going to get worse when Title 42 ends next week.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,The Left’s pro-abortion agenda is highly disturbing.  An unborn child is a human life.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Biden’s decision to end Title 42 will fuel the current catastrophe at the border created by the Biden Administration’s open border policies. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,More than 234K encounters in April.More than 70K gotaways in April. It's time we build the wall fully reinstate the 'Remain in Mexico' policy and renegotiate the Asylum Cooperation Agreements with the Northern Triangle countries. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,A gallon of gas in all 50 U.S. states is hovering above $4.This is the highest average ever recorded.We must invest and prioritize American energy production.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,.@RepTroyNehls is right President Biden must reverse his disastrous catch and release policies and secure our border. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,We must open up America's oil and gas resources for extraction and development.We must bring small business taxation down to stimulate our economy.We must secure our border. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Looks like the Facebook overlords are attempting to censor me and @FreeBeacon.These folks don’t want Americans to know the truth. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Congress is sending $40 billion to Ukraine and is ignoring serious issues here at home. Under the Biden Administration we have:Empty shelves at grocery stores.Historic gas prices.Crumbling infrastructure.  Rampant crime. A wide-open southern border.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,The southern border is wide open right now.The Biden Admin is failing the brave men and women serving on the front lines. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Biden's solution for everything? Spend more. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,The better solutions are to distribute formula currently in the hands of federal agencies and reduce regulatory barriers that would allow for the expansion of domestic formula production.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,This legislation would make baby formula shortages worse for most Americans. It will allow WIC to utilize a far greater portion of the baby formula market crowding out many hard-working American families.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Throwing tens of millions of dollars at the FDA–an agency arguably responsible for facilitating this crisis—is not a viable solution. Empowering the Secretary of the USDA so that they can waive administrative requirements for the WIC program is ineffective and artificial.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,THREAD re: Baby Formula Vote. It is imperative to find solutions to address Biden’s baby formula crisis.But what my congressional colleagues have proposed tonight does not address the core issues of this crisis.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Biden’s open border policies are directly responsible for creating an unprecedented border crisis that is continuing to get worse. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Biden does not have the authority to deploy American troops to Somalia. What is even our national interest here?I guess Biden didn't learn from Afghanistan. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Biden’s solution to address the nation’s baby formula shortages? Ask your doctor for free samples. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,65 MILLION innocent babies have been killed since the Roe v. Wade decision.Many Democrats see no problem with this. We need to change our attitude towards the most precious humans in life. 
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Details below:
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Today I joined @RepMullin's effort to expunge the second impeachment of President Trump.The radical Left exploited the power of impeachment for political purposes. This institution and the American people deserve better.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Looks like Biden's ""Ministry of Truth"" is already shutting down after barely operating for a month. This board was a total joke since Day One. Nina Jankowicz was a bigger joke.  I'm proud to see Americans stand up and oppose this radical board and its dangerous views."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Border officials encountered 234K illegal aliens at our southern border last month–the most in U.S. history. But it's actually even worse. This figure does not account for ""got-aways"" or folks who cross the border illegally but cannot be apprehended due to bandwidth issues. "
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Crime is skyrocketing across the country especially in Democrat-run cities. During National Police Week House Democrats brought no bills to the floor in support of law enforcement. We must support our nation's law enforcement. Period.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,As National Police Week comes to an end we will continue to honor the heroes who dedicate their lives to keep our communities safe and remember the fallen who gave the ultimate sacrifice.#NationalPoliceWeek
