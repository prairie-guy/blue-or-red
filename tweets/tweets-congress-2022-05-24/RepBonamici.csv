RepBonamici,Take a listen to the AANHPI Heritage Month playlist put together by @CAPAC! I chose to highlight two artists with ties to Oregon: @jbrekkie (same with @RepPeteAguilar) and @Beaubeaubarina. 
RepBonamici,This is another major accomplishment; we are excited to see what Rishab does next!
RepBonamici,Congratulations to @RishabJainK for winning the top award at the 2022 #RegeneronISEF science competition! Rishab from Westview High School was previously named America’s Top Young Scientist when he attended @StollerMS. 
RepBonamici,@FGSchools' partnership with @Childinst's Early School Success program is an impressive example of how we can help our children and families thrive with the right policies and resources. (2/2) 
RepBonamici,We know that getting our kids off to a strong start in school sets them up for success later in life. (1/2)
RepBonamici,Lack of affordable housing affects all Oregonians but falls hardest on our low-income and historically marginalized communities. I am grateful for the work and leadership of West Tuality Habitat for Humanity to expand our affordable housing stock in NW Oregon.
RepBonamici,Thank you to @WestTualityHFH for hosting me today! The project they submitted is one of 15 priority projects I submitted for federal funding. This investment will create affordable housing with a focus on promoting racial equity. 
RepBonamici,Oregon farms like the Duyck’s have gone through devastating losses in the past year from record heat drought wildfires &amp; smoke &amp; winter storms. I supported extending farm relief funding for the 2020 &amp; 2021 seasons which will help cover losses caused by natural disasters.
RepBonamici,It was great to start the day by touring the Duyck Family Farm (and getting a ride in the quad)! The farm was established in 1907 and today they grow Kotata blackberries blueberries grass seed wheat and more. 
RepBonamici,Thank you @SMeieran for inviting @JoannPDX and me to this important youth mental health forum on Saturday. Many students have been struggling over the last few years and I appreciated hearing their stories. 
RepBonamici,I am troubled by reports of companies employing illegal union-busting tactics like firing pro-union workers and limiting discussions of workplace conditions. The Senate should pass the PRO Act to protect the right to organize.
RepBonamici,Congratulations to the workers at four Portland Starbucks stores who voted to unionize! Unions give workers a seat at the table to negotiate for better pay benefits and working conditions.
RepBonamici,Although the initial cost is higher than conventional diesel buses the long-term benefits are more than worth the investment. I’m glad to see the EPA help more schools afford low and zero-emission school buses. 
RepBonamici,I got to ride in one of these buses last year! Electric buses are good for the health of our children our community and our planet. 
RepBonamici,The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law dedicates $12 billion to driving alternatives including $5 billion to make our streets safer for everyone who uses them. After a year in which 42915 people died on our roads these investments are long overdue. (3/3)
RepBonamici,Unfortunately too many of our streets are designed for motorized vehicles and not for people biking walking or rolling. If we want to get more people of their cars we must make our streets more friendly to non-car users. (2/3)
RepBonamici,Happy #BikeToWorkDay! Biking reduces carbon emissions traffic congestion and is good for your health. (1/3)
RepBonamici,The most recent @IPCC_CH report has an urgent message: we must cut emissions and we must do it now. We owe it to the next generation and to the many communities in Oregon and across the country threatened by rising seas wildfires and extreme heat. (2/2)
RepBonamici,I have met many of the young climate activists in our state and they are clear-eyed and convincing. It’s on the leaders and elected officials of this country to finally take bold action on climate to save lives and our planet. (1/2)
RepBonamici,Full letter here (3/3): 
RepBonamici,Many restaurant owners have told me that the Paycheck Protection Program was complicated and confusing. Many are now saddled with debts they understood would be forgiven. I am a co-sponsor of the bipartisan House version of this bill and called for its passage. (2/3)
RepBonamici,This vote is disappointing and will hurt small businesses. Many of our restaurants and entertainment venues have not recovered from the pandemic and the aid in this bill is essential to their survival. (1/3) 
RepBonamici,Congratulations to the St. Helens HS Band for winning the OSAA 5A State Championship! I commend your dedication to music and your superb performance on high school’s biggest stage. You should all feel proud of your accomplishment and the hours of practice that went into it. 
RepBonamici,The support contained in this package will help protect a free Ukraine.
RepBonamici,I applaud the Senate for sending the $40 billion Ukraine aid package that the House passed last week to the President’s desk. The immoral war Putin is waging threatens the lives and livelihoods of everyday Ukrainians. 
RepBonamici,Many of my @HouseDemocrats colleagues and I gathered today to unequivocally denounce the horrific and hateful mass shooting carried out by a white supremacist in Buffalo and the racist rhetoric espoused by the shooter. (2/2)
RepBonamici,Hate has no home here. Not in our country and not in the People’s House. (1/2) 
RepBonamici,Read more here (3/3): 
RepBonamici,As long as we remain dependent on fossil fuels we will be at the mercy of the oil and gas industry. We must transition to renewable energy for the sake of our economy and our planet. (2/3)
RepBonamici,While prices at the pump have been soaring over recent months oil and gas companies have been raking in record profits and sending large dividends to their shareholders. I’m glad the House has passed legislation to prevent price gouging at the pump. (1/3)
RepBonamici,The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act will provide greater resources and a renewed directive to monitor investigate and prosecute cases of domestic terrorism. Congress must address the distressing rise in homegrown mass violence. (2/2)
RepBonamici,As recent tragic events remind us domestic terrorism remains a serious threat to our communities. This is especially true for communities from historically marginalized groups. (1/2)
RepBonamici,Full press release here: 
RepBonamici,I am pleased to reintroduce the Alan Reinstein Ban Asbestos Now Act with @SenJeffMerkley to protect workers and families by finally banning the importation manufacture and distribution of asbestos.
RepBonamici,It is long past time for the United States to ban asbestos. It is unacceptable that this known carcinogen continues to threaten our communities.
RepBonamici,It would also require higher education institutions to give clear information about their learning accommodations. 3/3
RepBonamici,Currently students with disabilities are frequently required to get expensive new evaluations before they can access special education services. My bill will allow students to use existing documentation of disability to access support services on campus. 2/3
RepBonamici,Before bills can get a vote on the floor they go through the committee process. Today the @EdLaborCmte moved my bipartisan RISE Act legislation forward in as part of the Mental Health Matters Act. RISE will help ease the transition to college for students with disabilities. 1/3 
RepBonamici,Equal work deserves equal pay whether you sell concessions in the stands or play on the pitch. Congrats to the @USWNT on their historic contract win! I look forward to seeing the team continue to dominate the international field and inspire the world with their activism. 
RepBonamici,You can order more free COVID-19 test kits! After filling out this short form USPS will ship 8 free test kits to your mailbox. 
RepBonamici,By easing non-safety related regulations WIC can help provide proper nutrition to our underserved and low-income families during this infant formula shortage.
RepBonamici,It’s hard to see so many families struggle to find formula and feed their babies. Today I will help the House pass a bill to grant emergency authority to the WIC program so it can address supply chain disruptions and recalls. #FeedOurInfants 
RepBonamici,Today we celebrate the 57th anniversary of #HeadStart! Millions of children and their families have benefitted from this important anti-poverty program and it’s on us to make sure Head Start has the support it needs to serve all children in need in our community. 
RepBonamici,Our state has been leading the effort to electrify our transportation system and this funding will help move us to a better greener future.
RepBonamici,Oregon will receive $52 million over the next 5 years to support the expansion of EV charging stations across the state along with the opportunity to apply for $2.5 billion in EV charging grant funding.
RepBonamici,6 months ago @POTUS signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This historic investment championed by our very own @RepPeterDefazio will allow us to repair our aging roads and bridges improve transit expand broadband internet and more.
RepBonamici,I've long advocated for the updates included in this legislation which will foster more partnerships like Oregon's OMIC increase access to supportive tools like child care and expand apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships.
RepBonamici,Workforce development programs have the power to change lives and strengthen our local economies. Today I helped the House pass this important update to the Workforce Innovation &amp; Opportunity Act.
