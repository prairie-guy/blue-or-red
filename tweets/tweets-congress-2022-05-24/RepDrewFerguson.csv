RepDrewFerguson,Absolutely tragic - praying for the children teachers and the entire Uvalde community. üôè 
RepDrewFerguson,Join me today at 1pm for a virtual event on ‚ÄúAntibiotic Resistance: A Looming Public Health Crisis.‚ÄùWe‚Äôll discuss the looming threats antibiotic-resistant superbugs pose and the importance of the #PASTEURAct.‚û°Ô∏è 
RepDrewFerguson,Biden‚Äôs big government socialist policies are hurting hardworking Americans. Instead of working to bring back energy independence and relief at the pump the administration is doubling down on their radical Left agenda. 
RepDrewFerguson,Today and every day we honor those who serve in our Armed Forces. To all past and present service members a grateful nation thanks you for your selfless service commitment and dedication to our country and the preservation of America‚Äôs freedom. 
RepDrewFerguson,In April alone there were 234088 illegal crossings at our southern border. Despite the dramatic increase from previous years Biden plans to lift Title 42 and supercharge the already unmitigated crisis.Why won‚Äôt Joe secure the border and keep Americans safe? 
RepDrewFerguson,Coming up soon on @FoxBusiness‚Äô Cavuto: Coast to Coast. Tune in!
RepDrewFerguson,.@RepMeuser nails it on the head.¬†If Central America accounts for 29% of COVID infections then @JoeBiden and Congressional Democrats need to explain why lifting Title 42 ‚Äî a public health authority ‚Äî is a good idea.¬†Or are they intentionally trying to make matters worse...? 
RepDrewFerguson,Great to be with you today! If we invest in #AntibioticResistance and pandemic preparedness to correct market failures now we can save millions of lives and #SquashSuperbugs later.The PASTEUR Act will accomplish just that. 
RepDrewFerguson,"A big win!Following strong opposition from @HouseGOP &amp; backlash from the American people Biden is finally abandoning his ""Disinformation Governance Board"" idea.¬†DHS should focus on combatting terrorism and securing our border not suppressing our First Amendment rights. "
RepDrewFerguson,It was great speaking with Pike Middle School students this morning in D.C. to discuss my job as their Congressman and service to the 3rd District of Georgia. Thank you for your insightful questions and I hope you have an outstanding rest of your trip to our nation‚Äôs Capital! 
RepDrewFerguson,I've long advocated for workforce development &amp; apprenticeships.Unfortunately Democrats' Workforce Innovation &amp; Opportunity Act (WIOA) prioritizes unionizing &amp; reporting requirements over enacting critical reforms to these programs.This is not the bill Americans need.
