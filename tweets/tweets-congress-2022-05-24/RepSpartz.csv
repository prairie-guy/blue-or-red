RepSpartz,Anyone who harms innocent children is a coward. We join together in prayer for the victims of todayâ€™s shooting in Uvalde TX. Let us all rally around the victimsâ€™ families &amp; their community during this heartbreaking moment.
RepSpartz,A special thank you from the bottom of my heart to all who served our Great Nation and protected our Freedoms! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸#ArmedForcesDay 
RepSpartz,Great conversation with the French Senate and EU Parliamentarians during our bipartisan 84th Transatlantic Legislatorsâ€™ Dialogue visit to Paris. Thank you to the Embassy of Romania for hosting us today! 
RepSpartz,The Judge made the right decision given the ongoing humanitarian and security crisis on our border. Ending Title 42 restrictions without proper replacement mechanisms is reckless. 
RepSpartz,The situation in Ukraine further exacerbated the effects of bad energy &amp; manufacturing policies of the radical left which can also destabilize the whole world not just Europe politically &amp; economically if nothing is done about the blocked Odessa ports. 
RepSpartz,Today I co-chaired the first classified hearing of@GOPoversight on U.S. aid to Ukraine. I appreciate Chairwoman @RepMaloney &amp; Ranking Member @RepJamesComer for supporting proper accountability to the U.S.Congress in a bipartisan manner.More here:
