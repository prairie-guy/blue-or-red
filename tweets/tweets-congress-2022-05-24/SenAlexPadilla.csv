It‚Äôs past time.

SenAlexPadilla,Keeping Title 42 in place is a violation of our asylum laws that will continue to put people in danger.  Using a misguided public health regulation for border enforcement isn't a solution to our broken immigration system -- it is unlawful immoral &amp; inconsistent w/ our values.
