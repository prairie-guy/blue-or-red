RepLaTurner,I am heartbroken to hear the news out of Uvalde Texas. Join me in praying for the families of the victims and the entire Uvalde community as they navigate this horrific event. Thank you to the brave law enforcement officers and first responders that arrived on the scene.
RepLaTurner,An ISIS plotter was planning to assassinate George W. Bush w/ a team of terrorists he wanted to smuggle across our wide-open southern border.27 ppl on the terror watch list were already caught trying to cross the border this fiscal year.Border security is national security! 
RepLaTurner,Thanks to soaring inflation caused by Democrats' reckless federal spending Americans will be forced to pay more for their travel plans this summer.Inflation is a tax on ALL Americans. It's time to pass the Inflation Prevention Act and get control of this crisis. 
RepLaTurner,"Gas prices are $4.59 per gallon. Instead of discussing ways to unleash American energy &amp; lower prices at the pump President Biden praised this crisis as an ""incredible transition."" Democrats are clearly fine with $6 gas if it advances their radical Green New Deal agenda. "
RepLaTurner,Fentanyl is the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18-45 and continues to devastate families across Kansas.It's great to see Kansas Sheriffs down at the border addressing this worsening crisis head-on with @RogerMarshallMD.
RepLaTurner,The Biden Administration was supposed to lift Title 42 today—resulting in roughly 500000 illegal immigrants crossing our border each month. But a federal judge blocked President Biden's reckless plan. Now let's pass the Border Security for America Act &amp; end this crisis. 
RepLaTurner,Last year Democrats passed the radical American Rescue Plan &amp; pumped trillions of taxpayer dollars into the economy. As a result Americans are now facing the highest inflation in four decades. 
RepLaTurner,Today on Armed Forces Day we honor the brave servicemen and women who sacrifice so much to protect our country and defend our freedoms.We can’t thank these heroes enough for their continued service to our nation. 
RepLaTurner,Criminals weapons &amp; drugs are all coming across our border in record numbers. So far in FY22 CBP arrested or seized: - 393 known gang members- 27 people on the terrorist watch list- 50578 lbs of illegal drugs- 6600 pounds of fentanyl We must secure the southern border. 
RepLaTurner,My office is here to help you navigate the burdensome red tape and regulations of the federal government. If you are having an issue with the VA the IRS the State Department or any other federal agencies visit  or give us a call at 785-205-5253. 
RepLaTurner,As a father of four young children I understand how scary the current baby formula shortage can be for Kansans. This week I was proud to vote for the Access to Baby Formula Act introduced by @RepSteel to address the current crisis and help ensure it never happens again. 
RepLaTurner,Today is the 10th straight day of record-high gas prices in America. Experts predict the price of gas will surpass $𝟔 𝐩𝐞𝐫 𝐠𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐧 nationwide by August. Americans can't keep footing the bill for President Biden's anti-American energy agenda. 
RepLaTurner,Law enforcement officers across this nation put their lives on the line for the well-being of our communities.Last night I was proud to vote in favor of this legislation to expand mental health benefits for police officers and first responders.👇👇 
RepLaTurner,Great news → After overwhelming pushback from Americans President Biden's ridiculous Disinformation Governance Board is paused and Nina Jankowicz has resigned. This is a big win for free speech! 
RepLaTurner,It's the best when I get to spend time with Kansans in Washington D.C.Today I got to meet with students from Humboldt Middle School and show them the U.S. Capitol Building! 
RepLaTurner,🚨 APRIL BORDER UPDATE 🚨 Over 234000 illegal immigrants crossed our southern border in April—the highest in DHS history and a 1200% increase from 2020. This crisis is out of control and President Biden refuses to act.
