RepSteveChabot,This morning I had the honor of meeting with an outstanding group of Veterans at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport on their way to DC for an #HonorFlight. Our nation is indebted to you for your service and sacrifice. Thank you and God bless all of you! 
RepSteveChabot,Also that #Taiwan wasn’t invited is unconscionable. Taiwan is a high-standards economy &amp; one of our top trading partners. Its inclusion in what amounts to an economic club would have greatly benefited each of the IPEF’s pillars. Leaving Taiwan out is a needless bow to the #CCP.
RepSteveChabot,The biggest problem with the IPEF is that the Administration failed to include market access provisions which is what the region really wants and which would have given us something to offer in exchange for advancing the interests of American workers and businesses.
RepSteveChabot,But there are major problems with IPEF. First the Administration has been working on the IPEF for months now but today’s announcement said that members would start “discussions toward future negotiations.” In other words at this point we are just talking about talking.
RepSteveChabot,Therefore it’s good to see that in addition to the United States the IPEF will include Australia Brunei India Indonesia Japan Republic of Korea Malaysia New Zealand the Philippines Singapore Thailand and Vietnam which collectively make up 40% of global GDP.
RepSteveChabot,The Indo-Pacific has 60% of global population and will be the top driver of the world’s economic growth for decades to come. It’s absolutely critical that the United States shows economic leadership in a region on which our economic future will increasingly depend.
RepSteveChabot,China is setting the trade rules in the Indo-Pacific to the detriment of American consumers and businesses. The President’s announcement today of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is a welcome step to get us back in the game but the framework leaves much to be desired.
RepSteveChabot,It was an honor to welcome over sixty new American citizens from over 30 countries last week. May their strength and determination to become U.S. citizens persevere as they pursue the American Dream. God bless you your families and this great nation. 
RepSteveChabot,Recently I had the opportunity to meet everyone at King’s Honda. After a quick tour we discussed the supply chain crisis workforce shortages and tax relief. Thank you for your time! 
RepSteveChabot,
RepSteveChabot,To commemorate #NationalPoliceWeek  I spoke on the House Floor urging my colleagues to support the brave men and women who serve in law enforcement. Specifically we must make sure they receive the care and benefits they so desperately need and deserve. Watch my remarks below ⬇️
RepSteveChabot,It was an honor to speak at the opening of the Darnesha: A Glimpse into Hindu Civilization exhibit in Mason. This informative exhibit helps to dispel misconceptions about and promote understanding of Hindu culture. Thank you so much for having me!
