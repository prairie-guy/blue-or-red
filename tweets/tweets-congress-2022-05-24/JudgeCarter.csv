JudgeCarter,As a father and grandfather Erika and I are devastated to hear of the shooting in Uvalde today. Our hearts go out to the victims their families and the first responders. We are lifting up Uvalde in prayer.
JudgeCarter,Having a porous border has real national security implications. Every day that the border is overwhelmed increases the risk of terrorism on our soil b/c we have no idea who is coming into our country. President Biden must act now to secure the border. 
JudgeCarter,The leak of the Dobbs draft opinion was a direct assault on the independence of SCOTUS. The Leak &amp; Lose Act establishes $ penalty &amp; permanent forfeiture of admission to practice in fed courts for any individual found guilty of unlawful removal of SCOTUS opinions or draft opinions 
JudgeCarter,"In Democrats' world up is down down is up men can get pregnant and 65% of people saying the President is ""slow to react"" is a positive. "
JudgeCarter,It is crazy that we are seeing the numbers at the border that we are seeing and this administration still wants to end Title 42.
JudgeCarter,I'm fighting to secure the border! I've secured $4.8 billion for the border wall stopped the housing of illegal immigrants at Ft. Hood and introduced the USA Act to stop asylum fraud. 
JudgeCarter,We are now on our tenth day of record setting gas prices. Don't forget Biden promised they would drop when he announced he was releasing from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve....another broken promise from this administration.
