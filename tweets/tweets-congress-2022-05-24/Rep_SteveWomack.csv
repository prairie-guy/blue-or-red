Rep_SteveWomack,To Isaac Rebecca Dominik Samuel and every graduating member of the Class of 2022—congratulations! A grateful nation salutes you!  @WestPoint_USMA 
Rep_SteveWomack,They have sworn a solemn oath to defend at all costs—and I know the principles of Duty Honor Country will always guide them. It has been an honor to watch their journey as Chairman of the BOV. 
Rep_SteveWomack,The Long Gray Line never ceases because courageous young men and women continually step forward to serve America. Four years ago these cadets walked onto these grounds ready to start their path of service. Now they leave as the next generation of the Army. #USMA2022

Rep_SteveWomack,We honor their service—and the knowledge and experiences they gained in uniform. The high school diplomas they are receiving today recognize the leadership and tremendous foundation of service to community and service to country they embody. Congrats to the Class of 1956! #Heroes
Rep_SteveWomack,Carl Stults Bobby Burke Charles Leroy Moon and Bob Self were arguably “just kids” when they put their lives on hold for the sake of their country. They left high school and served in the Korean War to defend freedom. Today @sdaleschools presented them with their diplomas! 
Rep_SteveWomack,The Corps is formed! These strong young men and women are prepared to defend America and join the greatest Armed Forces in the world. @WestPoint_USMA 
Rep_SteveWomack,"Under a perfect blue sky we're watching the Corps of Cadets complete the traditional pass and review for the commemorative Graduation Parade. This moment is historic to West Point and symbolizes the passing of leadership from seniors aka the ""firstie class"" to the junior class. "

Rep_SteveWomack,As Ranking Member of the @HouseAppropsGOP FSGG Subcommittee I participated in a hearing on the Fiscal Year 2023 budget request for the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. You can watch my remarks and questioning here:  
Rep_SteveWomack,It’s unthinkable knowing families are struggling to find formula. There is no time to waste in addressing this crisis and ensuring this vital source of nutrition is readily available. It's why I'm supporting the Formula Act alongside @RepBice @RepFeenstra.
