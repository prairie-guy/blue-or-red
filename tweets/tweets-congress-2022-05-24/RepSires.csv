RepSires,My heart breaks at this senseless loss of life. I am thinking of the families and loved ones of those killed and the entire Uvalde community. This should not be happening. School should be a place of learning and growth for our kids not one of fear and death. 
RepSires,Yesterday I joined all of my @HouseDem colleagues in approving $28 million supplemental appropriations to address the baby formula shortage crisis and prevent any future shortages which put additional strain on millions of families with young children.
RepSires,Head Start began 57 years ago today as a project to expand access to pre-K as part of LBJ’s War on Poverty. Head Start has proven to improve emotional and behavioral development and educational outcomes demonstrating that investment in our nation’s children benefits our future.
RepSires,This month encourage loved ones in need to seek the mental health care they deserve. We must do more to break down the stigma surrounding mental health and increase access to mental health care for all who need it. #MentalHealthMonth
