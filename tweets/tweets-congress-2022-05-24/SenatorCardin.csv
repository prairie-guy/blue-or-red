SenatorCardin,To combat the dual epidemics of hate and gun violence lawmakers – at every level of government – need to put saving the lives of our constituents ahead of any political pressures.
SenatorCardin,As I’ve said many times before thoughts &amp; prayers are comforting for the victims &amp; their families but not sufficient. We must work together translate our grief into collective action that demands change to make our neighborhoods safer for every American.
SenatorCardin,The root cause of the baby formula shortage? Four companies control about 90% of the market for baby formula. Work stoppages in one plant means trouble for families. I am grateful for @POTUS’ leadership and action to increase the baby formula supply. 
SenatorCardin,Federal #TeamMaryland is using every resource we have to help modernize MD’s infrastructure. Today I joined @LeaderHoyer to highlight the $1M we secured in FY22 funding to support the widening of MD 4 and Thomas Johnson Bridge replacement. 
SenatorCardin,Delegate @RobbynLewis46th continues to lead by example. This is true bravery. Speak up when you see wrong. #StopAsianHate

SenatorCardin,Marylanders this weekend temperatures are likely to soar through the 90s. The sudden temperature rise creates a higher risk of heat-related illness. Stay hydrated. Check on your neighbors. Don’t forget about your pets.

SenatorCardin,While we didn’t get the 60 votes we needed today I remain committed to being a voice for small businesses in the Senate and will continue pushing to provide them with the support they deserve from the federal government.
SenatorCardin,The House already acted. @SBAgov is prepared to process RRF applications if they receive additional funding. The only roadblock is the Senate so I am deeply disappointed that despite bipartisan support from a majority of Senators we were unable to move forward on this bill.
SenatorCardin,At the beginning of the pandemic Congress made a commitment to help #SmallBiz navigate this crisis. For the #SmallBiz that are still struggling the COVID-19 pandemic remains an emergency that requires emergency spending from Congress to #ReplenishRRF.
SenatorCardin,The #EqualRightsAmendment will improve protections against violence unequal pay for equal work pregnancy discrimination LGBTQ+ discriminatory laws restrictions on health care and more. We need #ERAnow
SenatorCardin,How a nation treats its women is a barometer of success. Equality for all Americans is long overdue. We need the #ERANow.
SenatorCardin,Many Americans believe that our Constitution already protects against discrimination on the basis of sex but it does not. We must change that by adding the #EqualRightsAmendment to the Constitution. #ERANow 
SenatorCardin,We must #ReplenishRRF to save the beloved restaurants that are staples in our daily lives. If we allow these restaurants to disappear through inaction they will leave holes in our communities that cannot easily be filled.
SenatorCardin,Throughout this war Ukraine has shown strength and resilience. It is important to see the U.S. resume operations in Kyiv and to see the U.S. flag once again flown above the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. #StandWithUkraine 
SenatorCardin,National Public Works Week allows us to celebrate the outstanding people who build operate and maintain the essential systems that support our daily lives. Thank you to all those who work hard to maintain our critical infrastructure.
SenatorCardin,This Mental Health Awareness month we must ensure all Americans get the care they need and that they never feel afraid to ask for it.
SenatorCardin,All Americans deserve equal pay for equal work like the women of the @USWNT. That is why I am the lead sponsor on #SJRes1 legislation to remove the deadline on the #EqualRightsAmendment.
SenatorCardin,GOAL! Last year we introduced the Give Our Athletes Level Salaries (GOALS) Act to require the U.S. Soccer Federation to agree to provide equitable pay to both the women’s and men’s national teams in order to receive federal funds related to the 2026 World Cup.
SenatorCardin,The U.S. Women’s Soccer team are reigning champions on the field but also champions in leading the national conversation on equal pay.Well done @USWNT and @ussoccer. More should follow this model. 
SenatorCardin,More than two years into the pandemic restaurants and bars are still struggling and nearly 200K are still waiting for grants from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. Congress must #ReplenishRRF. It’s a matter of basic fairness.
