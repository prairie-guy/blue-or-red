RepKirkpatrick,When will enough be enough? Our Country has failed on taking action on gun violence and innocent people pay the price. From Buffalo NY to a TX elementary school - we have a responsibility to act. I send my prayers to all families impacted. It's horrific. 
RepKirkpatrick,The well-being of the @USNationalGuard and Reserve troops &amp; their families is of paramount importance. Watch my hearing with @AppropsDems today as we discuss the funding and needed to support them ➡ 
RepKirkpatrick,About 50% of infant formula sold nationwide is purchased by low-income families who rely on WIC benefits. Last week I voted to support legislation to improve WIC participants’ access to formula products and ensure they are not left behind. #FeedOurInfants 
RepKirkpatrick,As a mother and grandma I am horrified by the recent infant formula shortages I have seen. We must ensure AZ families always have access to safe formula. I have worked w/ my Dem colleagues to pass emergency funding to address this shortage immediately and #FeedOurInfants NOW.
RepKirkpatrick,Oil companies’ price gouging and market manipulation has led to record high fuel prices at the pump and Americans have had enough. Today I supported legislation to end these anti-consumer practices while also bringing some essential transparency to this secretive market.
RepKirkpatrick,Over the past 57 years Head Start has grown from an eight-week summer session to a comprehensive program stretching all 50 states and territories. Join us today in celebrating Head Start's 57th birthday:  #HappyBdayHeadStart #57YearsOfHeadStart
RepKirkpatrick,Going to the grocery store &amp; seeing empty shelves with no infant formula in sight is distressing for any parent. @HouseDemocrats &amp; I are voting for a bill that will help #FeedOurInfants by providing the FDA with the resources it needs to address this shortage
