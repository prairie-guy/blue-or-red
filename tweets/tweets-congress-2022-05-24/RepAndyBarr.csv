RepAndyBarr,Now House Dems voted down legislation I supported to send existing fed funds to boost baby formula production &amp; prohibit the FDA Commish from travel unrelated to the baby formula crisis until it is solved.

RepAndyBarr,Not only is ESG a scam it will worsen our inflation crisis drive gas prices even higher and hurt investors by diminishing the returns of IRAs 401k plans and 529 college savings plans.
