RepJohnKatko,Iâ€™m pleased to announce $1.5 million in federal funding from the bipartisan physical infrastructure law will be delivered to Oswego and Wayne County to clean up and redevelop local sites that have been contaminated by industrial pollution. 
RepJohnKatko,Last year the annual count of overdose deaths in the United States surpassed 100000 for the first time ever. These are being fueled by the surge of fentanyl pouring across our southern border. I joined @marthamaccallum to discuss this.
