SenJohnBarrasso,Once again today Americans are paying the highest price for gasoline than ever before.  Families are running out of places where they can cut their spending in order to pay for gas. Joe Biden is the president of high energy prices. 
SenJohnBarrasso,Four years ago today @SenSchumer called on @POTUS to “stand up to OPEC” and other “oil-rich countries.” Not a peep from him now as Pres. Biden begs OPEC for more oil - instead of producing energy at home. 
SenJohnBarrasso,@SenSchumer Four years later it's even MORE important to push @POTUS to fight for lower gas prices. It’s time for more American energy.
SenJohnBarrasso,In 2018 @senschumer criticized the president for inaction on high gas prices. The national average was $2.87/gallon. Today it’s $4.59. RT if you support expanding American energy to help get pump prices back under control. 
SenJohnBarrasso,Four years ago @senschumer was outraged about high gas prices – at $2.87 a gallon. National average is $4.59 today. RT if you support more American energy to bring prices down. 
SenJohnBarrasso,Whether it's the border energy the economy or coddling dictators we have a president who is not leading. 3 out of 4 Americans say the U.S. is heading in the wrong direction. @POTUS' numbers are at an all-time low. We must get Republicans in charge of the House &amp; the Senate. 
SenJohnBarrasso,President Biden’s Interior Secretary refused to admit gas prices are too high. This administration is in denial. It’s been ten straight days of record-high gas prices for Americans. 
SenJohnBarrasso,The Department of the Interior has done everything possible to shut down oil &amp; gas. @POTUS says he wants his administration to encourage more American energy. Instead @Interior stalls postpones &amp; kills oil and natural gas lease sales. 
SenJohnBarrasso,Wyoming will be well represented at the @DOE_SC_NSB National Finals by the students at Lander Valley HS. Congratulations to the team and staff at @LanderSchools and good luck! Wyoming is proud of you. #NSB2022 
SenJohnBarrasso,The American people are paying the highest prices for gas ever. People understand that we have the energy in the ground in the United States &amp; Pres. Biden will not let us get it out. Americans are convinced @POTUS doesn’t have any solutions to get rid of this pain at the pump. 
SenJohnBarrasso,One day @JoeBiden said higher gas prices were due to Putin’s price hike but the very next day he cancelled oil and gas lease sales. The American people see through this. Joe Biden has lost all credibility in terms of his ability to deal with inflation and the cost of energy.
