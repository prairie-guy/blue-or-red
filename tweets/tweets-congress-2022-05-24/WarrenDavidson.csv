WarrenDavidson,ü§î If only there was a plan to ‚Äúbe fruitful and multiply.‚Äù 
WarrenDavidson,Crypto is no longer new. @SECGov and @CFTC have not worked with Congress to provide regulatory clarity. Instead @SECGov has selectively enforced opaque regulations issued fake guidance and tied legit companies up with endless paperwork drills - driving Americans offshore. Sad. 
WarrenDavidson,Not even if you have decided to live in a commune‚Ä¶ When they say they want to ‚Äúfundamentally remake America‚Äù they mean it. 
WarrenDavidson,@NoWay14894688 @All435Reps No I think everyone agrees on that particular point.

WarrenDavidson,Remember when Hillary Clinton said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll just have to change your doctrine?‚Äù She meant it. Their woke heresy code is not compatible with Catholic doctrine and no one can serve two masters. 
WarrenDavidson,Same. It would also be great if Congress - my colleagues and the people charged with actually making laws - would provide regulatory clarity and accountability for the selective destruction they have inflicted on our markets. Token Taxonomy Act is 100% bipartisan and ready to go. 
WarrenDavidson,Woke definitely has a heresy code‚Ä¶ 
WarrenDavidson,@ACTBrigitte Practice.
WarrenDavidson,ü§îMaybe a picture says more than a 3 tweet thread? 
WarrenDavidson,I am strongly opposed. WHO still refuses to pressure China for access to COVID origins data. This corrupt agency needs reformed or closed not expanded with more funding and more influence. Joe Biden is going the wrong way - again.
WarrenDavidson,Obviously none of these are binding treaties without Senate ratification and any strong President would simply withdraw from them but the entanglements and mixed messages continue to weaken our nation making us less free less safe and more burdened by debt.
WarrenDavidson,The Biden Administration seems to have an uncanny ability to surrender America‚Äôs sovereignty. Whether the Paris Accord Iran nuclear deal covering for a weak and under-funded NATO (at America‚Äôs expense) or new global health standards (the latest issue)‚Ä¶
WarrenDavidson,This must be fully exposed by a @HouseGOP majority in 2023. Then Durham and others must work to restore justice to the Department of Justice. That will take a long term commitment and very aggressive reform consummated under a strong Republican President. 
WarrenDavidson,@mjs_DC Nope. They simply said the @SECGov has to provide due process - like my Due Process Restoration Act would require.
WarrenDavidson,#PSA: The bills Congress names are far better than their content. We had some nicely named bill this week. Here is an article about one of them with an an explanation of how it would actually make a bad situation worse. Don‚Äôt judge a bill by its title‚Ä¶
WarrenDavidson,DC Dems turned their backs on law enforcement. Now liberals on Ohio‚Äôs Supreme Court are too. Ohio‚Äôs legislators care about the safety of their constituents so our judges MUST be allowed to consider the safety of victims and the community when setting bail. #HJR2 #KeepOhioSafe
WarrenDavidson,Every state and local government is bound by Constitutional prohibitions against actual discrimination.
WarrenDavidson,Army introduces new break contact drill‚Ä¶  
WarrenDavidson,@Jestopher_BTC @Melt_Dem @PeterMcCormack @SolGh0st @CryptoEthan ü§£üçø
WarrenDavidson,@Melt_Dem @PeterMcCormack @SolGh0st @CryptoEthan Y‚Äôall are too kind. That was definitely one of my favorite hearings. It‚Äôs truly a shame so little good has been done by Congress on such an important issue. Thankfully the market isn‚Äôt waiting on Congress but momentum there is finally building‚Ä¶ ü§û
WarrenDavidson,#GoodNews Court rules the SEC‚Äôs use of Administrative Law Judges unconstitutional. We have been working to protect defendants with legislation. This should prove the point and hopefully expedite our bill. Note: the defendant has fought for a fair hearing since 2011! 
WarrenDavidson,It‚Äôs time to admit ESG is simply a social credit system. 
WarrenDavidson,ü§î Science?!?!SMH xy ‚â† xx@RepDanBishop 
WarrenDavidson,"Thanks @BurgessOwens! ""Abortion is not healthcare."" "
WarrenDavidson,Thanks for highlighting! This list is growing in the House and Senate. Thanks America!üá∫üá∏ 
WarrenDavidson,They‚Äôll never concede the point but at this point everyone knows it‚Äôs true. Well said.
