RepMikeRogersAL,The MAJORITY of Americans support Title 42. The Biden administration should listen.
RepMikeRogersAL,"Biden then: “No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill.”Biden now: High gas prices are part of an ""incredible transition"" away from fossil fuels.Taking more of your hard-earned money is all part of his socialist plan."
RepMikeRogersAL,Sounds like Biden just admitted higher gas prices are all part of his socialist plan. 
RepMikeRogersAL,Seeing higher gas prices this weekend? You can thank Joe Biden. 
RepMikeRogersAL,Biden’s runaway inflation means more money is coming out of your pocket just to buy the necessities.
RepMikeRogersAL,Parents deserve a say in their children’s education.
RepMikeRogersAL,Most Americans think we’re heading into a recession – Biden’s policies are to blame. 
RepMikeRogersAL,The Biden administration needs to take the crisis at our southern border seriously.  Finish building President Trump’s wall and secure the border.
RepMikeRogersAL,President Biden keeps failing Americans. 
RepMikeRogersAL,Today and every day we honor the countless sacrifices of the brave men and women who serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. U.S. service members are the greatest force for good the world has ever seen. 
RepMikeRogersAL,Open borders mean that drug cartels have unfettered access to our communities. The majority of fentanyl in the U.S. comes across the southern border – but Biden has continued to ignore this crisis.
RepMikeRogersAL,We need to secure our border and finish building President Trumps border wall. 
RepMikeRogersAL,Of the nearly quarter of a million migrants that crossed our border last month (a record high) nearly half were expelled via Title 42. Biden wants to undo Title 42 next week ignoring Congress border communities and border patrol agents. 
RepMikeRogersAL,Over 2.6 million illegal migrants have crossed our border since President Biden took office. Now he’s looking to undo Title 42 NEXT WEEK even as the crisis worsens at our southern border. 
RepMikeRogersAL,Biden’s rising inflation and gas prices are making it harder for all Americans to make ends meet. 
RepMikeRogersAL,Lifting Title 42 as record numbers of illegal migrants flood our borders is like walking outside in a Hurricane. It’s dumb.
RepMikeRogersAL,The far-left have intimidated Justices outside of their homes attacked a pro-life office and continue to try to bully and harass the Supreme Court into ignoring the Constitution for political purposes. 
RepMikeRogersAL,The Department of Homeland Security should take all funding meant for the ‘Ministry of Truth’ and direct it towards securing our border and finishing President Trump’s border wall. 
RepMikeRogersAL,A ‘pause’ of Biden’s Ministry of Truth isn’t enough. DHS should use all funding from Biden’s Ministry of Truth to finish building President Trump’s border wall and secure our border. 
RepMikeRogersAL,Speaker Pelosi forced through the House a politically motivated sham impeachment resolution against President Trump. I proudly joined @RepMullin in cosponsoring legislation that would expunge the unjust second impeachment against President Trump.
