RepTedDeutch,Honored to be a conferee for the USICA-COMPETES Act which will make historic investments in research &amp; manufacturing and advance U.S. competitiveness. I'll work to ensure the final bill expedites refugee processing for Uyghurs &amp; addresses Chinese exports of fentanyl precursors. 
RepTedDeutch,Still so moved by my colleagues' bravery to share their stories.  With everything going on in our nation and in the world we cannot forget that abortion rights are under attack in our nation. 
RepTedDeutch,The decision whether to have an abortion isn't just a constitutional right. It's a decision that women have the right to make in accordance with their own faith &amp; practice. Proud to see the Jewish communityâ€™s advocacy on this critical issue. 
RepTedDeutch,Baby formula is a necessity for thousands of families across the country. This week I was proud to join my colleagues to vote in support of $28 million in additional funding for the FDA and increased latitude for low-income families to purchase baby formula during this crisis.
RepTedDeutch,I discussed last week's troubling Lufthansa incident with its CEO Carsten Spohr this morning. We cannot allow antisemitism to go unchecked. I urged Lufthansaâ€™s CEO to thoroughly investigate demand accountability and set an example of how corporations must confront antisemitism.
RepTedDeutch,My condolences to the people of the UAE on the passing of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.  We will continue to work together to enhance the US-UAE &amp; regional partnerships.
RepTedDeutch,As I discussed with Sec. Blinken preventing a nuclear Iran must be non-negotiable but the US needs a comprehensive Iran policy.
RepTedDeutch,The int'l community must pressure Iran to be completely forthcoming about its nuclear activities and to cooperate with the IAEAâ€™s investigations of its nuclear program to uphold the mission of the IAEA &amp; to ensure the legitimacy of the int'l nuclear non-proliferation movement.
RepTedDeutch,I echo IAEA DG Grossiâ€™s concern that Iran isn't being transparent about its nuclear program after traces of uranium were found at undeclared sites in Iran and await the next report on the IAEAâ€™s ongoing investigation. 
RepTedDeutch,I had the honor of meeting with @KingAbdullahII last week where we discussed the strong US-Jordan partnership the recent tensions in Jerusalem and how the U.S. can work with Jordan and Israel to expand cooperation throughout the region. 
RepTedDeutch,I strongly condemn the Iranian regime's abhorrent practice of taking foreign nationals hostage for political gain. Ahmadreza Djalali CÃ©cile Kohler &amp; Jacques Paris must be released immediately as well as all Americans that have been held by Iran for far too long.
RepTedDeutch,Last week Iran announced it will execute a Swedish citizen on unfounded charges seemingly as a response to a Swedish court preparing to issue a verdict on a suspected Iranian war criminal and detained two French nationals while the EU envoy to the nuclear talks was in Tehran. 
RepTedDeutch,I condemn the two recent attacks against Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai and express my condolences to the Egyptian people. The US-Egypt counterterrorism partnership is critical and we stand with Egypt against terror and violence.
RepTedDeutch,Abortion is not the problem hereâ€”taking away the Constitutionally protected rights of women and enabling threats to the lives and freedom of abortion care providers is.This attack on Roe is not about life. It's about power intimidation and control. 
RepTedDeutch,"""In a few days we will come to the end of #JewishAmericanHeritageMonth but our efforts on behalf of the Jewish community should just be getting started.""Read my full statement on today's passage of H.Res. 1125 here ðŸ‘‡"
