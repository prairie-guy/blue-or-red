JayObernolte,"I'm proud to announce this year's #CA08 Congressional Art Competition winner is Raquel (grade 12) for ""Heartless"" followed by Jenny (grade 11) and Johanna (grade 12). Congratulations to all three of you on your hard work &amp; artistic prowess!  "
JayObernolte,Yesterday I was honored to be presented with a certificate of appreciation from Rim of the World Veterans Outreach for my work helping veterans in our District. Supporting our veterans has been and will continue to be among my highest priorities as your representative. 
JayObernolte,Ultimately however it is critical that we stabilize our economy &amp; lower inflation if we hope to end the ongoing supply chain crisis. I am continuing the fight by pushing back against irresponsible gov't spending &amp; fighting to keep dollars in the hands of the American taxpayers.
JayObernolte,This week I cosponsored H.R. 7718 the Formula Act to direct the FDA to agree to an international standard for infant formula to speed importations &amp; voted in support of H.R. 7791 the Access to Baby Formula Act to help protect WIC participants from future supply disruptions.
JayObernolte,The baby formula shortage is a serious crisis for families here in #CA08 &amp; across the nation. Unfortunately the failure of the federal government to proactively address the supply shortage after closing the Abbot plant means it may now take months for supplies to reach shelves.
JayObernolte,An all-of-the-above approach to expanded American domestic energy production will lower global emissions capitalize on American innovation to create jobs lower prices and export our energy and technology to the world. Learn how here: 
JayObernolte,US military systems are under constant threat from our adversaries. There is a global race to perfect and deploy AI in the warfighting arena and we must ensure our military has the best possible AI capabilities to defend against those who would seek to do our nation harm.
JayObernolte,I am proud to introduce the AI for National Security Act alongside @RepJimmyPanetta to ensure DOD is able to leverage AI cybersecurity applications to give our nation’s defenders the best tools possible to prevent and defeat cyber-attacks. 
JayObernolte,California experiences both wet &amp; dry years. We must address our serious shortage of water storage with legislation such as the WOW Act &amp; Emergency Drought Relief Act that I’ve cosponsored to build our water reserves in the wet years &amp; ensure adequate supplies in the dry years.
JayObernolte,More than half of the country's fruits nuts and vegetables are grown here in California. That production can't occur without reliable water and the prices we pay for these vital foods will increase even further as supplies diminish.
JayObernolte,Communities across the country will feel the effects of California's poor planning in water storage this summer with potential shortages of fruits vegetables and nuts brought on by California's drought conditions and the global supply chain crisis.
