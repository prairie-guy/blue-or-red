RepGarbarino,This tragedy comes on the heels of the recent Buffalo shooting the pain of which is still fresh. New Yorkers stand with you and share your grief.
RepGarbarino,What a horrific and senseless act of violence in Texas. There is a special place in hell for monsters capable of such evil.Praying for the families of the dead taken far too young for the injured including two responding officers and for the entire Uvalde community.
RepGarbarino,The Access to Baby Formula Act which I proudly voted for this week was just signed into law. Unlike the partisan Infant Formula Supplemental Appropriations Act this bill lays out steps to address this crisis and prevent such a formula shortage from occuring in the future. 
RepGarbarino,Freedom is not free. Today on #ArmedForcesDay we honor the men and women serving in defense of our great nation. Please join me in thanking our servicemembers across all branches of the military for keeping us safe and defending our freedoms. üá∫üá∏ 
RepGarbarino,This is the right decision. Keeping Title 42 in place is just common sense until the border crisis is under control. 
RepGarbarino,TY to cosponsors @RepJohnKatko @RepMeijer @Congressman_JVD @RepMeuser @RepMariaSalazar @RepLaTurner @RepCarlos and @RepMcCaul for joining me in this effort to prevent members of violent TCOs from gaining access to this country. More here‚¨áÔ∏è 
RepGarbarino,Border patrol is overwhelmed by the record-breaking number of migrants attempting to cross our border allowing TCOs like MS-13 to slip through the cracks and infiltrate our country. This bill would strengthen the ranks of law enforcement tasked with stopping TCOs at the source.
RepGarbarino,This week I introduced the DHS Transnational Criminal Investigative Units Supplemental Pay Act to take on MS-13 and other transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) at the source and head off these violent criminals before they ever reach our border. 
RepGarbarino,Congratulations @dilipnewyork. Well-deserved. 
RepGarbarino,Proud to join @GReschenthaler in cosponsoring and voting for this bill to extend mental health benefits to public safety officers.
