RepTomEmmer,Jacquie and I are absolutely heartbroken to hear about the tragedy unfolding in Uvalde. Praying for the entire Robb Elementary community and the families of those lost in today’s senseless act of violence.
RepTomEmmer,Any U.S. backed CBDC must be open permissionless and private.  Anything less than that is nothing more than a government surveillance tool. We must understand the problems a CBDC could solve before considering launching one. 
RepTomEmmer,President Biden’s reckless economic policies are leading to stagflation.The print-and-spend mindset in Washington D.C. must end.
RepTomEmmer,Joe Biden’s anti-energy agenda is actively harming the American people.There is nothing “incredible” about it. 
RepTomEmmer,Inflation is destroying Americans’ ability to save for the future. Americans on average have $9000 less in their savings accounts than they did in 2021. 
RepTomEmmer,
RepTomEmmer,Families across America are scared due to widespread baby formula shortages. Areas of Minnesota are dealing with out of stock levels as high as 47%.This weekend I sat down with @esmemurphy at @WCCO to discuss this ongoing crisis. 
RepTomEmmer,Over the weekend I chatted with @SwanSit at @veecon in Minneapolis about the future of web3 in the United States and government’s responsibility to not mess it up.  Great to speak with an awesome engaging audience.  Remember: Your government works for you.
RepTomEmmer,Inflation is impacting every sector of the American economy. It has nothing to do with “corporate greed” and everything to do with bad economic policy. 
RepTomEmmer,Thank you to everyone who came to my town hall in Blaine on Friday! These events are important as they give me a chance to hear about the issues directly impacting the Sixth District.If you didn’t get a chance to attend you can always email me at:  
RepTomEmmer,Unbelievable. President Biden would rather appease socialists in Venezuela than give up his regulatory barrage on American energy.
RepTomEmmer,Homicide rates have increased 48% in 2022 compared to 2020 according to @MjrCitiesChiefs.Americans cannot afford any more of Democrats’ soft-on-crime policies.
RepTomEmmer,Proud to support @RepDonaldsPress and @SenTuberville Financial Freedom Act of 2022.
RepTomEmmer,Self-directed 401(k) accounts should be… self directed. Congress will ensure the government cannot prohibit Americans from investing part of their self-directed 401(k) accounts in Bitcoin or any other assets.
RepTomEmmer,New CBP data reported 234088 migrant encounters in April a record high. Less than half were expelled under Title 42 a policy the Biden Administration is ending in 3 days. 
RepTomEmmer,Earlier this week I met with the Minnesota Petroleum Marketers Association. We discussed how the Administration’s regulatory assault on the energy industry has resulted in soaring energy bills for American families. 
RepTomEmmer,Inflation is crushing American working families.President Biden’s careless economic policies are directly at fault. 
RepTomEmmer,Great to meet with leaders from Sherburne County yesterday to discuss my support for ongoing infrastructure projects in the Sixth District!

RepTomEmmer,Open. Permissionless. Private. The United States government should never design a surveillance tool that puts us in line with China’s digital authoritarian state.
RepTomEmmer,This is why ahead of next week’s Financial Services Committee hearing on CBDCs I joined @PatrickMcHenry and the @FinancialCmte in a letter to @FederalReserve Chair Jerome Powell concerning the Fed’s recent CBDC white paper. 
RepTomEmmer,.@FinancialCmte wants to understand what problems a CBDC would solve BEFORE we create and launch one.
RepTomEmmer,Earlier this week I had the chance to meet with representatives from @WYTorganization. Thank you for all you do to assist amputees with their recovery! 
RepTomEmmer,Inflation will cost the average American family more than $5000 this year. The Biden Administration’s inflation crisis is impacting all of us but it’s hurting working families the most. 
RepTomEmmer,Our law enforcement officers work tirelessly everyday to keep our communities safe.I am proud to support @RepJuliaLetlow’s resolution to honor our fallen officers. 
RepTomEmmer,Another day of record high gas prices due to the Biden Administration’s regulatory assault on the energy industry.
RepTomEmmer,via @POLITICOPro
RepTomEmmer,.@GaryGensler you put all of the SEC’s taxpayer funded resources into crypto crackdowns. Now you don’t have the funds to do your actual job so you’re coming to Congress for more? You’ve got to be kidding me. 
RepTomEmmer,Prices are surging wages are falling and our economy is shrinking – a perfect recipe for stagflation.Democrats’ reckless economic policies are directly responsible. 
RepTomEmmer,Baby formula is not a luxury it is a necessity. The Biden Administration’s failure to address this shortage has only made this crisis worse.
RepTomEmmer,Great news via @washingtonpost – The American people are not interested in government bureaucrats dictating “truth.” 
RepTomEmmer,.@HouseGOP WILL shut down this Orwellian attempt to censor our free speech.
