RepSchneider,I am sickened by the news from Uvalde Texas of a deadly shooting at Robb Elementary School. My thoughts are with the families of the children murdered with all those hurt and the entire Uvalde community. 
RepSchneider,Something has to be done about violent extremism in the United States. This law will give law enforcement tools they need to keep us safe.
RepSchneider,The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is at work in Cook County!Today I was in Wheeling celebrating the completion of major work on Lake Cook Road. Cook County received millions in federal grants towards this project. With the Infrastructure Law we’ll continue to rebuild Illinois. 
RepSchneider,High prices at the pump are crushing Illinois families. Oil executives have used Putin’s war as cover to hike their prices. In DC last week I voted to hold corporations accountable for their price gouging.  
RepSchneider,No child should go hungry in the United States of America. This week Congress passed two bills to help families find formula. 
RepSchneider,Strong democracies working together means we are all safer. I am hopeful for our future with Sweden and Finland joining NATO.
RepSchneider,On to you @SenatorDurbin
RepSchneider,Just passed the House with a bipartisan vote! Onto the Senate. 
RepSchneider,There will be more shooters like those in Buffalo in El Paso and at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We cannot sit idly by as domestic violence extremism spreads across our country.We must take action. Tonight we will pass the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act. 
RepSchneider,The House condemned rising antisemitism today in a strong bipartisan vote. I was honored to get to celebrate the vote with @deborahlipstadt our Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism. 
RepSchneider,Tonight the House votes on legislation - the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act -  to send a message that we stand with federal law enforcement we stand with American communities and we stand against domestic terrorism. 
RepSchneider,The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act we are voting on today is the right bill for this specific moment. I am proud of this piece of legislation which I have shepherded with Senator Durbin since 2017.
