RepCohen,Tennessee has gone beyond in allowing anyone to LEGALLY carry. NO TRAINING OR BACKGROUND CHECKS ! Wild West mentality. Boot Hill ! 
RepCohen,Thoughts and prayers don’t work. Republicans need to stop genuflecting to NRA and help pass some gun lawsmental health and red flag laws ( Buffalo). People need guns to kill! Wake up and let’s pass some laws to bolster safety. 
RepCohen,Vlady I wouldn’t go to Russia if you gave triple frequent flyer points and free borscht (yuk).You’ve made Russia the armpit of the world! Worse than  valuesno humanity. Just lemmings cold to genoocidal sufferings and crooks living high while people suffer
RepCohen,Living! And serving Tennessee 9 and America and it’s democratic values 
RepCohen,Соединенные Штаты Америки (США) - Министерство иностранных дел Российской Федерации Russia finally got around to banning me! I thought this had been done years ago but I guess they’re a little slow on the uptake just as they are in #Ukraine! #Russiagof… 
RepCohen,Gorsuch Barret and Kavanaugh all said that Roe was settled law when they were confirmed. It was right then and it’s right now! 
RepCohen,@AngelaDanovi @timburchett Oh ! This was directed to Tim. Was shocked Angela but I didn’t read upstream before tweeting.Tennessee Hope lottery scholarships are best thing that happened to education in our states history. Yes it’s been messed up since I’ve been gone but it still produces $’s for students
RepCohen,@AngelaDanovi @timburchett Respectively you don’t have knowledge of the lottery scholarships that have provided over $6 billion for Tennessee students. None of this would’ve occurred but for my work over 18 years to bring it to the people.Sponsor of constitutional amendment and bills to make it law.
RepCohen,I'm deeply concerned about the baby formula shortages I've seen. House Dems are working to pass emergency funding to address this shortage immediately and @POTUS is working to boost supply. Here also is a guide to help you find formula during the shortage.
RepCohen,If the Supreme Court lets red states outlaw abortion half the country will lose access to abortions unless you have enough time and money. In Memphis you’ll have to go to Illinois and Tennessee could even put a bounty on your head for being involved with an abortion. 
RepCohen,Big Oil is exploiting Putin's war in Ukraine to raise prices and boost its profits by pouring money into stock buybacks and dividends instead of increasing supply. Today House Dems voted to prohibit exploitative price increases and hold price-gouging companies accountable. 
RepCohen,Last year’s traffic fatality spike emphasizes the need for major road safety improvements which is why I worked to include Complete Streets policies in the Infrastructure Law. 42915 deaths is absolutely unacceptable and we must continue to prioritize making our roads safer. 
RepCohen,If Republicans take control of Congress they will outlaw abortion in all 50 states. Not just Mississippi Texas and all these red states but EVERYWHERE. We can’t let that happen. 
RepCohen,Our democratic system is built on checks and balances. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution Civil Rights and Civil Liberties I continue to examine reforms to ensure no President can misuse or abuse emergency authorities. 
RepCohen,I was proud to sponsor this $3 million project to improve Tom Lee Park along with 9 other projects to bring nearly $12 million back to Memphis and Shelby County.
