RepAdamSchiff,The shooting at Robb Elementary in Texas is a horror.My heart aches for the families devastated by this tragedy and the Uvalde community.Children are dying and we could do something about it. But the GOP won’t stand up to the gun lobby.Shameful doesn’t begin to cover it.
RepAdamSchiff,The House just took action to crack down on Big Oil's price gouging.$6 a gallon for Californians is unacceptable and unnecessary — the result of corporations putting profits over people.The best solution?Holding Big Oil to account and going all-in on green energy.
RepAdamSchiff,COVID-19 revealed vulnerabilities in our supply chains for critical goods – but a shortage of baby formula is as urgent as it gets.Tonight we passed bills to remove unnecessary barriers to access and get stock back on shelves.Babies shouldn't bear the brunt of this crisis.
RepAdamSchiff,I’ll fight for my Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act.That's just one solution. More are needed like banning assault weapons and extended clips and universal background checks.We must end the cycle of violence.Whatever it takes to keep our people safe.
RepAdamSchiff,Think about it.When it was discovered the tobacco industry knowingly sold products that could kill Americans victims could sue for damages.Why shouldn't families torn apart by gun violence be able to do the same when gun dealers act negligently?My bill would enable that.
RepAdamSchiff,It's called the Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act.It would repeal the law which makes the gun industry exempt from being sued in most cases.Why should an industry that's done so much damage to America enjoy immunity?
RepAdamSchiff,The gun industry has no incentive to support safety measures to keep guns out of the wrong hands.So we need to hit them where it hurts: Their wallets.That means passing laws that would ensure negligent gun makers and dealers are held to account.I have the bill to do it.
RepAdamSchiff,Buffalo. Houston. Laguna Woods. Amarillo. Winston-Salem.Five mass shootings in one weekend. Two hundred and three mass shootings so far this year.It's easy to grow numb to the bloodshed.But it doesn’t have to be this way – we can stop this.Here's how we start:
RepAdamSchiff,Closely monitoring reports of a brush fire burning near Griffith Observatory. Right now firefighters are working nonstop to put this fire out. Please remain vigilant and follow instructions from local law enforcement agencies should the need to evacuate arise. Stay safe LA!
