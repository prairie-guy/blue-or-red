RepBrianMast,Baby formula is being flown in on military planes. This is a scene you’d expect out of Venezuela not Indiana. 
RepBrianMast,So will Biden defend Taiwan or not? He is incapable of speaking clearly or giving any degree of certainty to any of the nations who look to the U.S. for leadership.
RepBrianMast,Nikki Fried is trying to pretend she cares about our water but her policies continue to put the sugar industry before Floridians.  Check out the latest #LakeOFactCheck: 
RepBrianMast,People that loot and destroy businesses: “peaceful protestors.”Parents who want a say in their child’s education: “domestic terrorists.”That’s the message liberal school board activists are sending.
RepBrianMast,Our Resilient Coast and Estuaries Act will make a difference in preserving natural treasures from sea to shining sea.
RepBrianMast,Thanks to rampant pollution &amp; the Army Corps’ mismanagement of Lake Okeechobee water quality has declined for years. That’s why I fought for $100M in the 2022 Water Resources Development Act for water quality improvement projects in Martin St. Lucie &amp; Palm Beach Counties. 
RepBrianMast,Sunshine and freedom. Florida is without a doubt the best state in the nation.  California and New York - take notes. 
RepBrianMast,It’s #MilitaryAppreciationMonth and I can tell you with certainty I don’t regret a moment of my time in the military. From teaching me the values that I hope to instill in my kids to getting to work alongside some of the best people I’ve ever met the Army has made me who I am. 
RepBrianMast,The sad reality is the Palestinian Authority isn’t interested in a two-state solution. So why does the Biden Administration keep filling their coffers and enabling a fight against our strongest ally Israel?
RepBrianMast,At best they’re annoying. At worst these scams cost people thousands of dollars. That’s why I’ve voted in favor of bills like the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act. If you think you’re being scammed my office can help you contact the Florida Attorney General.
RepBrianMast,One of the biggest wins for our community in this year’s Water Resources Development Act is the Northern Estuaries Restoration Plan (NERP). My legislation would force the Army Corps to develop infrastructure to end ALL harmful discharges. 
RepBrianMast,This week we made huge progress towards our goal of ending discharges once and for all! Watch the latest #WeekInReview to learn about what’s in the Water Resources Development Act plus an update on baby formula and fuel prices. 
RepBrianMast,🚨A federal judge has AGAIN stopped Biden from revoking Title 42 or the “Remain in Mexico” policy. How many times will the judicial branch have to tell him “no” before he finally learns?
RepBrianMast,💧 $100 million for water quality projects in Martin St. Lucie and Palm Beach💧 A first-of-its-kind initiative to eliminate ALL harmful discharges to the estuaries💧 Funding to improve the Indian River LagoonWRDA is a WIN for our community.
RepBrianMast,Florida’s gentle giants are a national treasure. #SaveTheManatees
RepBrianMast,Does this mean the left’s argument is no longer “abortion is women’s healthcare”? 
RepBrianMast,Good news for freedom-loving Americans everywhere: Joe Biden’s plan to police “disinformation” is dead. We came entirely too close to recreating Orwell’s 1984. 
RepBrianMast,Unfortunately this doesn’t come as a shock. Biden’s botched withdrawal enabled our enemies and made the world less safe. 
RepBrianMast,Every two years I fight to include as many priorities for the state of Florida as possible in the W RDA.  This year’s bill includes huge wins for the St. Lucie Caloosahatchee Indian River Lagoon and Lake Worth Lagoon.  Check it out:
RepBrianMast,JUST NOW: House Democrats forced through legislation to impose socialist price controls on fuel. This is basic supply and demand: we need more supply not less and de-incentivizing production means that prices will continue to climb.
RepBrianMast,Well deserved! Congratulations again to Dreyfoos’ Amber Hansen for her first place win in this year’s Congressional Art Competition.
RepBrianMast,A massive win! The Water Resources Development Act just passed the Transportation Committee with 7 pieces of legislation I wrote including the Northern Estuaries Restoration Plan &amp; $100mil for new infrastructure to protect the St. Lucie Indian River Lagoon &amp; Lake Worth Lagoon. 
RepBrianMast,39 Members of Congress – Democrats and Republicans alike – just voted to allow glyphosate (subject of an $11 billion lawsuit settlement for increasing cancer risk) to be sprayed into bodies of water used for drinking water.  Completely unconscionable.
RepBrianMast,🚨 DHS temporarily “paused” the work of the “Disinformation Governance Board” aka the Ministry of Truth. This should only exist in a dystopian novel or maybe a history book about the USSR. I’ll keep the fight going in Congress until this “board” is permanently scrapped.
RepBrianMast,The federal government is literally poisoning the people that I represent. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers cannot be allowed to flush toxic water into our community.
RepBrianMast,HAPPENING NOW: The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is debating the Water Resources Development Act - or WRDA. This is the single biggest piece of legislation impacting water infrastructure and is crucial in our fight for clean water. 
RepBrianMast,Socialist price controls are never the answer. If House Democrats are serious about bringing down gas prices they must end their war on American energy.
RepBrianMast,I’ve been sounding the alarm on this for months: not only is the government robbing young people of their future and their chance to serve they are purging our military of those who are willing to think critically and challenge the process. Disgusting.
