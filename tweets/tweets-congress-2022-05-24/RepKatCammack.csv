RepKatCammack,Photos from yesterday's procession for #FL03 Hometown Hero Ssg. Seth Michael Plant. Weaving through Starke in Bradford County Ssg. Plant's hometown then through Penney Farms and Green Cove Springs in Clay County hundreds of folks paid their respects to one of our own. 
RepKatCammack,I joined Scott Anez on @WDBONews this morning to talk about the baby formula shortage and Biden's slow response only making matters worse. Take a listen! üéß
RepKatCammack,Great to join the team at @JAXPORT yesterday for the celebration of this tremendous project! Northeast Florida is a top destination for shipping both domestically and internationally! 
RepKatCammack,A beautiful scene from last week's event with the Women's Caucus at @womensmemorial in @ArlingtonNatl honoring our women veterans. Check out our video recapping the event below! 
RepKatCammack,Visited with some amazing first and third graders at Lake Butler Elementary in Union County on Monday to deliver books from the Library of Congress Book Surplus Program! We read a few books and each student got their own new book to take home. #ReadToLead 
RepKatCammack,Today citrus greening has caused Florida‚Äôs citrus industry to shrink by more than two-thirds and has caused over $8 billion in economic losses with thousands of jobs lost. It's time for the EPA to approve Vismax. 
RepKatCammack,This past Saturday in Middleburg we celebrated the Blue Star Memorial By-Way Dedication Ceremony with the Garden Club of Middleburg. #TeamKat presented a flag flown over the Capitol with a letter dedicated to the club. 
RepKatCammack,This past week in Palatka #TeamKat honored our fallen heroes at the 2022 Law Enforcement Memorial at the Palatka Riverfront. Our men and women in blue and green sacrifice their lives for us and it is our duty to honor those we've lost. 
RepKatCammack,Today please join me in thanking the more than two million members of our U.S. military forces during Armed Forces Day. Whether it's the U.S. Army Marines Navy Air Force Space Force or Coast Guard thank you for your service to our nation. üá∫üá∏ 
RepKatCammack,Without EPA approval of Vismax the citrus industry will experience crippling losses at the hands of infected trees which is why we need to make this safe and effective treatment readily available to our citrus producers. 
RepKatCammack,While I was in D.C. this week #TeamKat attended the Fallen Officer Memorial hosted by law enforcement agencies in Marion County. A beautiful tribute to dozens of men and women who lost their lives in the line of duty. Blessed are the peacemakers. 
RepKatCammack,Almost one-quarter of a million immigrants were apprehended at our southern border in April‚Äîthe highest number since the #BidenBorderCrisis began. If Title 42 ends this number will only grow threatening our national security and communities across the country. 
RepKatCammack,During #NationalEMSWeek we thank the men and women who work hard to respond to emergencies keep our communities safe and help in our time of need. As the wife of a first responder I'm tremendously grateful for the folks who run toward danger. Thank you for all you do! 
RepKatCammack,OH MY! The end of an era! Thank you Mick for being the dedicated passionate and energetic voice of the Gator Nation! üêä Cheers to the next chapter and of course #GoGators! üêä 
RepKatCammack,This is unacceptable. Our CBP agents are doing their absolute best in an impossible situation. 
RepKatCammack,"""With the cleanest safest and most efficient production practices worldwide the U.S. is poised to combat record inflation and deliver much needed energy relief to the American people.""My latest op-ed for @thehill here! "
RepKatCammack,Yesterday I had the opportunity to talk to district directors from across the country during their fly-in. As a former deputy chief of staff based in the district myself I shared my experiences alongside @RepYoungKim. I'm grateful for all the work our district teams do. 
RepKatCammack,Secretary Buttigieg said this administration has been working on the formula shortage since day one. Really? How can that be the case when moms and dads are scrambling pursuing nationwide searches to find formula for their children? It's an outright lie. 
RepKatCammack,Thank you also to @RepLucyMcBath @RepDean and @RepJenniffer for your leadership of the caucus @DeptVetAffairs CoS Tanya Bradsher and our honorees from @USArmy @USMC @USNavy @usairforce @SpaceForceDoD and @USCG. 
RepKatCammack,A beautiful ceremony honoring our women veterans those we've lost in the line of duty and our active duty heroes this morning at @ArlingtonNatl and @womensmemorial with the Bipartisan Women's Caucus. Thank you to my colleagues and co-chairs for your support. 
RepKatCammack,Talking with @VinceCoglianese at 4:05pm on WMAL. Don't miss it! 
RepKatCammack,We've never said it isn't the U.S. government's responsibility to care for these children. Our CBP agents are treating these children like their own‚Äîcaring for them in the most humanitarian and dignified way. @SecMayorkas should know that. 
RepKatCammack,"""The radical left‚Äôs culture war against our men and women in blue has driven policy decisions around law enforcement creating a public safety crisis of epic proportions.""My latest for @WashTimes about Biden's crime crisis plaguing U.S. cities. "
RepKatCammack,Nancy Pelosi wants to call us irresponsible? I'll tell you what's irresponsible: Biden's FDA shutting down a leading manufacturer with no plan to backfill the shortage. While the liberal media continues to claim what I said wasn't true I made a border trip to show the truth. 
RepKatCammack,Joining @DanaPerino and @BillHemmer on @AmericaNewsroom in just a few at 10:30am from Capitol Hill. See you soon!
RepKatCammack,Had the incredible opportunity to take our #FL03 @MCSOFlorida Sheriff Billy Woods on a tour of the White House with @RepWaltzPress and @FlaglerSheriff Rick Staly last week. Our LEO leadership in Florida is the best of the best and we were glad to host them during #NPW2022. 
RepKatCammack,"""Strong law enforcement is needed now more than ever. With rising crime &amp; drug and human trafficking growing well-trained forces with committed officers are in high demand."" Read my latest from @DailyCaller as we close out another #NationalPoliceWeek. "
