RepCloudTX,Thank you to GOA for exposing the ATF’s clear violation of the Second Amendment and thank you to @SenatorTedCruz for introducing the No REGISTRY Rights bill in the Senate.
RepCloudTX,Today Gun Owners of America revealed that ATF has in fact built a searchable and centralized firearms database.It is now more important than ever for Congress to pass my No REGISTRY Rights Act to dismantle this database and protect Americans' Second Amendment right. 
RepCloudTX,The Biden administration has turned what is supposed to be our border security apparatus into a human trafficking delivery system. They've continued to advocate for lawlessness over a lawful society. We must reverse this course and return to Trump-era border policies. 
RepCloudTX,Everything the Biden administration touches turns into a crisis.@RepJamesComer and I are leading an investigation regarding this administration’s failure to prevent this tragic baby formula shortage. 
RepCloudTX,The Left will do everything in their power to intimidate SCOTUS and pro-life advocates across our nation.The Justices must remain strong. Roe v. Wade should be overturned.
RepCloudTX,"The Biden administration shouldn't be ""pausing"" its Disinformation Governance Board they should terminate it.Free societies don't implement ""Ministries of Truth.""Shut it down. "
