RepMikeGarcia,Californians need relief from record-high gas prices NOW. @GavinNewsom – do not increase the gas tax!
RepMikeGarcia,God bless all our brave men and women who serve our nation both here and abroad. Thank you for your selfless service and sacrifice as you fight to protect our freedom and security. #ArmedForcesDay
RepMikeGarcia,I want to thank our local @LASDHQ officers for the dangerous work they are doing to eradicate these grows.We must fund support and defend our law enforcement and continue the fight to clean up the Antelope Valley and eliminate these illegal grows.
RepMikeGarcia,Today I took an aerial tour of the illegal marijuana grows in the Antelope Valley &amp; watched an illegal grow bust from the sky. It's striking to see just how much progress has been made to combat the grows since last year. 
RepMikeGarcia,Reactivating this program will improve our national security and defense capabilities support commercial space vendors and provide job growth and economic opportunity to California's 25th District.
RepMikeGarcia,I’m pleased that @GOPLeader @JayObernolte &amp; I have been able to secure $10.2 million to reactivate the AFRL Rocket Lab at @EdwardsAFB. 
RepMikeGarcia,@SFSpencer21 I'm accountable for funding these operations as an appropriator on the justice subcommittee. This is called oversight of your taxpayer dollars. I will continue to do so until this problem is gone.
RepMikeGarcia,I’m out here in the Antelope Valley at an illegal marijuana grow site in the midst of demolition. These illegal grows pose a real threat to our community and environment. Progress is being made but we must not stop in our efforts to eradicate these grows! 
RepMikeGarcia,I spoke about my Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act at a @HouseVetAffairs hearing. My bill would make it easier for military spouses w/ a professional license moving on military orders to retain their license and improve economic opportunity for our military families. 
RepMikeGarcia,Canceling domestic drilling sales is an interesting response to record high gas prices. Is the Biden administration even trying to relieve the pain at the pump? This drilling restriction will hurt Americans for years to come.
RepMikeGarcia,Last year I introduced the Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act. Today my bill received a @HouseVetAffairs committee hearing. I look forward to continuing to advocate for this critical bill that will improve economic opportunity for military families.
RepMikeGarcia,I promise to continue this fight until the problem is fully eradicated. My constituents deserve to feel safe in their homes and backyard not scared of the cartel members running illegal drug operations.
RepMikeGarcia,The progress made so far is possible only because of the combined efforts of local state &amp; federal officials &amp; law enforcement. We must encourage more of our local leaders especially the rest of the LA County Board of Supervisors to join us in the fight to combat the grows.
RepMikeGarcia,However with the Biden administration continuing to leave our southern border open and characters like George Gascon continuing to put criminals ahead of victims - our community will continue to see these cartel-run illegal marijuana grows in our backyard.
RepMikeGarcia,About a year ago I worked with @SaraCarterDC to bring national attention to the illegal marijuana grows taking over our community in the Antelope Valley. A month later @LACoSheriff launched what resulted in the largest illegal marijuana drug bust in LA County history.
RepMikeGarcia,Yesterday @LASDHQ announced more progress made in combating the illegal marijuana grows that continue to plague our community in the AV. I'm pleased that like myself @LACoSheriff remains steadfast in his commitment to eradicate these grows.
RepMikeGarcia,We’ve gained national media attention toured the grow sites met with impacted constituents collaborated with law enforcement and engaged with local state and federal officials – including most recently speaking with US AG Garland.
RepMikeGarcia,Since the moment I became aware of the illegal marijuana grows plaguing our community my office and I have led the charge to combat the problem.
RepMikeGarcia,Today @HouseCommerce is marking up the bill! Let's get this done and provide our communities with the mental health funding and services they need. 
RepMikeGarcia,Last month I introduced a bill to reauthorize funding for the Mental Health Block Grant program that is administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. I'm pleased that my bill was included in a larger mental health care package HR 7666.
RepMikeGarcia,During these challenging times we must double down on our efforts to secure our nation and support the American dream. Everything I said almost 2 years ago is just as important if not more important now.
