RepFrenchHill,Glad to join @RepDavidKustoff in introducing this commonsense measure. Formulas developed in 1978 have little connection to today and rural communities in Arkansas and across the country miss out on CDBG funding due to @HUDgov's antiquated formula. 
RepFrenchHill,Gas prices hit another all-time high today and itâ€™s becoming increasingly clear that the Biden Admin has no plan or desire to address it. They want prices to remain high to fulfill their green energy agenda and sadly it's the American people who suffer.
RepFrenchHill,Recently joined @carltonwing on his show Arkansas Great Outdoors for some rock climbing at the Nowlin Creek Climbing Area at Rattlesnake Ridge. Arkansas is home to numerous opportunities to pursue the great outdoors! 
RepFrenchHill,Looking forward to joining this important discussion on Wednesday. 
RepFrenchHill,This upcoming week is the second annual #GlobalWeekofPrayerforChina. I had the opportunity last week to recognize the significance of this week on the Floor of the House of Representatives and bring awareness to the unjust arrest of Cardinal Joseph Zen. 
RepFrenchHill,A win for common sense amid an unprecedented surge at our southwest border. 
RepFrenchHill,Joining @cvpayne on @FoxBusiness shortly to discuss the latest in markets and more.
RepFrenchHill,98% of US-consumed instant formula is made domestically. The supply chain is fragile and prone to supply shocks. The bills I've supported will help to fix this problem by providing an influx of baby formula immediately. (5/5)
RepFrenchHill,I've co-sponsored the Baby Formula Emergency Act which would allow the United States to import infant formula from other countries so long as the product is safe (HR 7822). (4/5)
RepFrenchHill,I've co-sponsored the Formula Act of 2022 to expand the supply of infant formula by directing the FDA to establish a base international standard for infant formula (HR 7718). (3/5)
RepFrenchHill,I have taken three actions to end the infant formula crisis. I voted to provide a waiver to allow those on WIC to buy infant formula that may not be WIC eligible normally (HR 7791). (2/5)
RepFrenchHill,I voted against HR 7790 because despite its title all it did was provide $28 million to the FDA for staff salaries and expenses. Congress recently allocated $102 million to the FDA with an additional $11 million included for infant health and nutrition. (1/5) 
RepFrenchHill,@SusyofAR House Dems rejected a Republican bill to allow existing funds be used to address the crisis while preventing the FDA commissioner from traveling until he submits a plan to address this shortage. I've also co-sponsored a bill to allow the US to expand the supply of infant formula
RepFrenchHill,@SusyofAR I voted against HR 7790 because Congress already provided the FDA an over $100 million increase in funding. This bill throws another $28 million at the FDA and does not require the FDA to come up with a plan to address the shortage.

RepFrenchHill,Yesterday I introduced H.R. 7799 the Public Servant Protection Act the companion legislation to the bill @SenTomCotton introduced in the Senate last week.This bill will ensure the safety of our public servants and their families.My full statement:
