RonWyden,Donald Trump's own accounting firm disavowed 10 years of his financial statements. The American people deserve to know why Trump’s accountants are cutting ties in light of ongoing tax and financial fraud investigations. 
RonWyden,Happy #KidsToParks Day! Join @NatParkTrust and enjoy the wonders nature has to offer you and your family. 
RonWyden,I've heard numerous accounts of mismanagement at the Social Security IG's office and expressed my concerns to the IG. These reports only add to those concerns. I‘ll be working to hold Social Security accountable for unfairly harming Americans who just want their earned benefits. 
RonWyden,As Oregon heads into what's expected to be another devastating fire season I'm fighting to make sure federal funds will be put to proper use on the ground to keep communities across Oregon and the West safe from these blazes. 
RonWyden,Great news from @intel about its investment in the Silicon Forest that will benefit Oregonians in every corner of our state. More evidence of how our state is integral to American economic innovation. 
RonWyden,As Oregon remembers Gerry Frank today at his public memorial in Salem I honor this iconic Oregonian’s illustrious life &amp; his tireless work to make our state an even better place to call home. He leaves an unforgettable legacy for generations to come. 
RonWyden,I wrote Aaron's law nearly a decade ago to protect researchers from misguided overzealous prosecutions. Glad to see DOJ is finally recognizing good-faith security research isn't a crime it actually makes us all safer. 
RonWyden,Instead of working to ensure the IRS can go after wealthy tax cheats Republicans are laser-focused on stripping the agency of what little budget it has left. I was just on the Senate floor to block their latest scheme.
RonWyden,Republicans have spent decades gutting the IRS budget rendering the agency unable to do its basic functions to serve the American people. Now Republicans are the guy in the hot dog suit swearing up and down that they're trying to find the guy who did this. 
RonWyden,Countless women are going to die because right-wing radicals on the Supreme Court want to turn back the clock on their bodily autonomy by a century. 
RonWyden,Kudos to the @USWNT for its dedication and hard work to achieve this long-overdue goal. 
RonWyden,Republicans have spent decades slashing the IRS budget to make it easier for their wealthy donors to get away with gaming the system. This is exactly why I'm fighting tooth and nail for robust IRS funding so it can go after wealthy tax cheats. 
RonWyden,Every person in America using a period tracking app should be concerned about how their data could be weaponized against them if Roe is overturned. It's absolutely essential that Congress protects Americans' data from shady brokers once and for all. 
RonWyden,.@SenBooker @SenMarkey @SenAlexPadilla and I will continue pushing regulators to get to the bottom of this and protect American consumers.
RonWyden,I'm urging the FTC to investigate whether  lied to consumers and government agencies about its facial recognition software. Americans shouldn't have to compromise their privacy to access essential government services. 
RonWyden,Families are struggling to find formula to feed their babies while Abbott is reaping the windfall of Republicans’ tax cuts and allowing infant formula plants to crumble. Today I'm launching an investigation into Abbott's tax-dodging and reckless spending on stock buybacks. 
RonWyden,This is an important first step in changing our country’s outdated harmful policy of isolation. I’ll continue pushing my legislation in Congress to establish normal trade relations with Cuba which is key to charting a new diplomatic course. 
RonWyden,Decades of Fox News and conservative propaganda have empowered white supremacists to carry out their manifesto of hatred bigotry and violence. White supremacy has no place in America. We must be united in our battle to defeat it.
