RepChrisStewart,President Biden is hoping that an America distracted by his own series of crises won't notice the attempt to give up sovereignty in Geneva.We noticed.And I will do everything in my legislative power to keep American decision-making where it belongs: with the American people.
RepChrisStewart,Why in the world does Biden want to move power and control from Americaâ€™s government to an international body of bureaucrats?If an American citizen didn't vote them into office they have no business telling us how to live.
RepChrisStewart,This week the @WHO is considering two disastrous amendments proposed by @POTUS.The amendments would allow the WHO to unilaterally declare a public health crisis in the U.S.Yes the same WHO who covered for China by denying their role in the origins of COVID-19.
RepChrisStewart,Nearly half of America's baby formula is out of stock. So what did Speaker Pelosi do this week?She gave everyone in Congress a Peloton membership that could cost taxpayers an extra $100K per month.America's parents need relief @SpeakerPelosi. Bring my FORMULA Act to a vote.
RepChrisStewart,Speaker Pelosi shut Republicans out of good-faith negotiations to solve the baby formula crisis.We just found out what her bill looks like...-Doesn't force the FDA to develop a plan-Doesn't account for excess stocks-Doesn't leverage existing transportation capabilities
RepChrisStewart,America's mothers and fathers need help and there is no time to waste. @SenMikeLee and I introduced this bill to give families the relief they need now.Nothing is less controversial than feeding American babies. Congress needs to pass this bill immediately.
