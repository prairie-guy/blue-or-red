RepNancyMace,Today I provided Lowcountry leaders with a quarterly update on all the work we've been doing for SC01 in Washington. It‚Äôs important as leaders to share concerns &amp; address problems together. (1/2)

RepNancyMace,Today I opened the Oversight Subcommittee hearing on school curriculum. What is taught in our schools should be with the goal of helping our students achieve their fullest academic and personal potential. 
RepNancyMace,Threats to our Supreme Court Justices are un-American. Our country is becoming more divided than ever &amp; this Administration was supposed to be a unifier not a divider. The rule of law should never be threatened. 
RepNancyMace,We need to ramp up supply NOW remove tariffs from imports &amp; ease restrictions. (4/4)
RepNancyMace,Last night Congress did what it always does when there‚Äôs a problem: throw money at the government &amp; hope for the best. What the House voted on DOES NOT fix the supply issue. Fact: Congress has already provided funding to address supply chain issues including the FDA. (3/4)
RepNancyMace,The FDA and the Administration knew there would be a sizable impact on availability in stores but failed to do anything about the coming crisis. Flash forward to now. (2/4)
RepNancyMace,So what‚Äôs really going on with formula? In February the largest producer of baby formula temporarily stopped production after a voluntary recall on their supply. (1/4) 
RepNancyMace,It‚Äôs sad we need a tool like this for our communities but much like the Amber and Silver Alert system the Active Shooter Alert can and will save lives. This bipartisan bill will help state &amp;  local authorities notify surrounding areas when there is an active shooter near by. 
RepNancyMace,Under the current Administration our nation continues to face unprecedented crises. Young parents are struggling to buy formula to feed their babies. In response I‚Äôve introduced a bill to temporarily lift tariffs on imports of infant formula. üëá

RepNancyMace,Bikes and Treads are all over $1000. Most people in Congress are not going to pay these prices for exercise equipment but still get this All-Access Membership for free? (2/2)
RepNancyMace,Not to forget-@SpeakerPelosi is giving everyone in Congress All-Access Memberships. These memberships require Peloton Bike Bike+ or Tread. @FoxBusiness article states no equipment needed however @onepeloton website says differently. (1/2) 
RepNancyMace,.@SpeakerPelosi is adding unnecessary spending and is costing the taxpayers even more. Think of what $100000 or more per month could fund instead. 
RepNancyMace,Wrong Carolina governor @GovInslee. Maybe you need a map. Houses are not falling into the Atlantic in my district. Also I work hard to keep our beaches beautiful &amp; environment healthy in SC01 &amp; have a 100% rating with the conservation voters of SC. Better luck next time.
