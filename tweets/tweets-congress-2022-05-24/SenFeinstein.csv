SenFeinstein,I’m just speechless at the evil that is running rampant and behind all of these acts is a firearm. After every shooting I ask how many deaths is too many? And after every mass shooting the news recedes as Republicans refuse to take any action to limit these deaths. 
SenFeinstein,Another day another mass shooting and more silence from the gun lobby and Republicans who refuse to allow any gun safety reforms to occur. Reports that 14 elementary school students and a teacher have been murdered are beyond tragic.
SenFeinstein,Racism homophobia and antisemitism have NO place in California. As violence against these communities spreads everyone must speak out with one voice that we will NOT accept such hatred in our communities. 
SenFeinstein,Today would have been Harvey Milk’s 92nd birthday. His unwavering dedication to fighting for equality will forever remain an inspiration. #HarveyMilkDay
SenFeinstein,Children aged 5-11 are now able to receive a booster shot five months after their first Covid-19 vaccination. Talk to your child’s health care provider and get them boosted to ensure they have the most protection against Covid heading into the summer. 
SenFeinstein,The funds passed yesterday are critical to support the people of Ukraine and defend democracy in Europe. These funds will provide critical military equipment to Ukrainians as well as food and supplies for millions of refugees who have been forced to flee their homes. 
SenFeinstein,This bill won’t prevent all mass shootings but it’s a small step that I hope will start to bring some sense of sanity back to our nation concerning firearms. I hope Republicans can at least support this small commonsense measure. Read more here:
SenFeinstein,The recent shooting in Buffalo showed us yet again the tragic consequences when young people can so easily obtain a deadly assault weapon. It makes no sense that it’s illegal for someone under 21 to buy a handgun or even a beer yet can legally buy an assault weapon.

SenFeinstein,More than 90% of wildfires in California are traced back to humans largely through unintentional errors. Check with local authorities regarding any burn bans before heading outdoors. Weather conditions can make a variety of tasks and activities dangerous.
SenFeinstein,Red-flag warnings are in effect for parts of Northern California today through this weekend. When wildfire conditions are high it’s imperative all Californians be safe and do their part to prevent the start or spread of wildfire. Follow this thread for tips and resources:
SenFeinstein,That's why the Senate must act to codify the right to abortion that women have relied upon for a half century. We simply cannot allow the conservative Supreme Court justices to deny women one of the most basic rights: control over their bodies.
SenFeinstein,Let’s be clear: striking down Roe won’t end abortions even in states that make abortions illegal. Instead it will deny women in those states access to safe abortions and it will mean some women will die.
SenFeinstein,May is Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month! I’m celebrating the AAPI community this month and its countless contributions to California and our nation as a whole. #AAPIHeritageMonth
SenFeinstein,For 57 years the Head Start program has helped low-income families ensure their children receive quality early-childhood education and support. Investing in early-childhood education is the smartest choice we can make to help children reach their full potential. 
SenFeinstein,We need an ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to meet this challenge including increasing our water supply incentivizing projects that provide environmental benefits and drinking water for disadvantaged communities and investing in environmental restoration efforts.
SenFeinstein,As the past two years have painfully demonstrated severe and prolonged drought exacerbated by climate change is the stark reality for the West. If we don’t take action now to improve our drought resilience it’s only going to get worse. 
SenFeinstein,I’ve been a champion along with @PattyMurray and others for nearly a decade in this fight for equal rights. I’m proud the United States is the first country to ensure the men’s and women’s soccer teams are paid fairly and I hope other nations will follow our lead.
SenFeinstein,I’m so pleased the women’s national soccer team has reached a labor agreement that will compensate them fairly for their successes on and off the field. The team has won four World Cups and four Olympic gold medals and they routinely outperform the men’s team in ticket sales. 
SenFeinstein,Judges Thompson and Sykes are extremely well-qualified and I’m proud to support both of them. The president is nominating and the Senate is confirming consistently well-qualified judges to the California bench to fill vacancies and address a judicial emergency. 
SenFeinstein,Please join me in congratulating all the Merchant Mariners of World War II receiving Congressional Gold Medals today! This recognition is long overdue and very well deserved. 
SenFeinstein,Safety regulations for products like cosmetics and deodorant haven’t been updated in more than 80 years. I’m delighted that provisions from our bill to bring these regulations into the 21st century are in the HELP Committee’s draft FDA reform legislation.
