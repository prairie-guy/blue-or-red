RepSwalwell,I wish I could look at my 3 small kids &amp; promise I’ll always protect them. That’d be a lie. America arms the most dangerous people to the teeth leaving every child vulnerable to being shot in their class. This is not a policy defect. It is by GOP design. RIP victims of #Uvalde
RepSwalwell,Why did Donald Trump let a terrorist into the United States? 
RepSwalwell,Let’s haul these two grifters before Congress. 
RepSwalwell,Sounds like the police are doing their job. Why don’t you do yours and fund more police? @housegop voted against $300m in community funding. 
RepSwalwell,@ASDem Have you watched the Warriors at all this season?!
RepSwalwell,Hi @Twitter “@RepDougCollins” hasn’t repped anything in awhile. Doug got pounded in the GOP Georgia senate primary by @KLoeffler (who got pounded in the general election by @ReverendWarnock). Most Georgians wouldn’t know Doug Collins from Tom Collins. Let’s strip the blue check. 
RepSwalwell,Donald Trump is calling for Civil War. Of course like Vietnam and the walk to the Insurrection he won’t be man enough to fight it. 
RepSwalwell,@RepDougCollins Very racy viewing content for a pastor! God bless you and your family Doug.
RepSwalwell,The GOP’s abortion plan is simple. They want to be at the kitchen table when young women decide whether to start a family. And they’re going to tell them they’re having a government-mandated pregnancy. Or they’re going to jail. 
RepSwalwell,Getting shit done. 
RepSwalwell,I’m still pissed off about Buffalo. We can’t just move on. We need a gun safety majority in the Senate to pass Background Checks and an Assault Weapons Ban. #EndGunViolence
RepSwalwell,@RepDougCollins Hi Doug. Are you still in Congress? Lost track of you. What’s the latest?
RepSwalwell,This👇🏼Grateful to @TheSpaceGal for being a voice on this issue. Breast-feeding mothers are subjected to humiliating treatment at airports. *Including my wife a few weeks ago. I’m working with Emily and my colleagues to create a “Trusted Travelers” program for mothers. 
RepSwalwell,@Storm4Congress Hey it’s you again I see. You lost your race for Congress. Change your Twitter handle. Scram.
RepSwalwell,Crisis meet action. Donald Trump would have staged a photo-op to throw a few bottles of baby formula to desperate moms. Biden Administration brought a loaded up plane. 
RepSwalwell,Эрик СУОЛУЭЛЛThat’s my name as printed on Russia’s latest round of sanctions. What took them so long?
RepSwalwell,@schinko94 My son turned five today. We had an Avengers party. It’s chalk on a blackboard. Thanks for sharing.
RepSwalwell,@icenycbx @ericswalwell Ha. We had an Avengers-themed birthday party today for my son.
RepSwalwell,Let’s care for each other today—and every day. Even if you’re sibling rivals! 
RepSwalwell,We are on our way!#DubNation Go @warriors!10/16
RepSwalwell,Covid has crushed our restaurants. @HouseDemocrats and @SenateDems have proposed reloading the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. Nearly EVERY Republican voted against it and killed the bill. Here’s what a Bay Area restaurant owner shared with me when he learned the bad news. 
RepSwalwell,That @fred_guttenberg can talk every day about what the loss of his daughter means to his family and his own resolve to #endgunviolence should inspire all of us to do more! 
RepSwalwell,Republicans: It’s Joe Biden’s baby formula crisis! Why aren’t Democrats doing more?!***@HouseDemocrats hold vote to fund more baby formula***@HouseGOP: NAY!!!!!!————————————Hi Republicans we’re getting shit done to solve problems. What’s your job? 
RepSwalwell,Warriors!9/16 — over half way there!#DubNation #NBAPlayoffs
RepSwalwell,Republicans aren’t interested in solutions. They’re interested in theater and chaos. @HouseDemocrats offered a baby formula solution to help your family. Almost every @HouseGOP member voted against it. #CommunityOverChaos 
RepSwalwell,This! 
RepSwalwell,My little buddy turned 5 today! Don’t grow up Nelson! 
RepSwalwell,Republicans don’t care about helping children after they’re born with child tax credits affordable education or removing guns that kill kids in schools. They're more focused on controlling women’s health care choices through government mandated pregnancies.
