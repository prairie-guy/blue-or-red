RepMalliotakis,What possesses someone to walk into a school &amp; kill small children? This is pure evil. The violence &amp; hate we are seeing in our nation is heartbreaking &amp; horrifying. There is an utter lack of respect &amp; appreciation for human life. We as a society must do better. #uvalde #texas
RepMalliotakis,How many people will have to become victims of violent crime before state officials take action? By refusing to reverse these dangerous policies New York's leaders are doing a tremendous disservice to those they've taken an oath to represent and protect.
RepMalliotakis,This shooting is absolutely tragic senseless &amp; sadly it was 100 percent preventable. The elected officials who continue to support the radical pro-criminal policies that are leading to the murder assault robbery or stabbing of innocent New Yorkers have blood on their hands.
RepMalliotakis,This violent gang banger with an extensive criminal history is the latest example of someone who shouldn't be free to roam our streets &amp; yet because of the policies put in place by NY's governor &amp; legislature an innocent man has been randomly killed. 
RepMalliotakis,This weekend the Port Richmond community and Dutch Reformed Church honored our veterans with their annual banners. Our office joins in paying tribute to our veterans especially WWII James Buonincontri father of our team member Cara. 
RepMalliotakis,Our office participated in a vigil to honor those killed in last week's horrific Buffalo attack. Our diversity is what makes this nation so unique. We stand with our fellow New Yorkers &amp; Americans in condemning this violence hate &amp; terrorism that has no place in the USA. 
RepMalliotakis,This week @HouseCommerce reported out humane legislation I cosponsored that would finally END animal testing for all new drug development protocols. I urge @SpeakerPelosi to now bring this to the floor so we can continue our work to protect innocent animals from this abuse! 
RepMalliotakis,üé• WATCH: Nicole blasts New York's criminal justice system on @FoxFriendsFirst following the latest crime spree by a perp released on bail. ‚¨áÔ∏è
RepMalliotakis,It would also be helpful if @POTUS got all his agencies back to work and fully staffed. Enough of the work from home COVID staffing levels. Federal agencies are essential for our country to function and if they aren‚Äôt eliminate them!
RepMalliotakis,FDA just got a $110M ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 months ago. Now Democrats solution to the baby formula shortage is to give FDA ANOTHER $28M when FDA just needed to reopen the plant shut down for 3 months streamline approvals &amp; set standards for imports! These guys never waste a crisis to spend!
RepMalliotakis,Update on the Fort Hamilton High School threats ‚¨áÔ∏èThank you to law enforcement for quickly identifying this individual and working to keep students and staff safe.
RepMalliotakis,How many more violent incidents will it take for City &amp; State officials to reverse their pro-crime policies that are making residents visitors and first responders less safe? New Yorkers deserve better.
RepMalliotakis,Last night an EMT serving #StatenIsland was shot by an individual he was treating in an ambulance. Thankfully he is in stable condition &amp; a retired #NYPD detective &amp; Sanitation Lieutenant were able to catch this individual after he attempted to flee. 
RepMalliotakis,I‚Äôve joined @RepRutherfordFL in introducing the Communities Deserve Cops Act &amp; am calling on @SpeakerPelosi to bring it for a vote!Our police are understaffed underpaid &amp; overworked. They need the support of elected officials &amp; Congress should lead the way! 
RepMalliotakis,As we wrap up #NationalPoliceWeek it was an honor to have members of @NYCPDDEA &amp; law enforcement from around nation at our @HouseGOP roundtable to discuss proposals to improve public safety support our police &amp; hold municipalities that don‚Äôt accountable. We #BackTheBlue! 
RepMalliotakis,If NY'ers can eat in restaurants attend school &amp; work out indoors without proof of vaccination @NYCSchools graduations should be open to all parents &amp; guardians regardless of vaccine status.I've called on @Realdavidcbanks &amp; @ashvasnyc to reverse their inconsistent mandates.‚¨áÔ∏è 
RepMalliotakis,The NYPD has installed metal detectors &amp; will maintain a police presence at the school for the time being. The last few days have been extremely disruptive for students &amp; staff. I appreciate the NYPD's attention to this matter &amp; hope the person responsible is identified quickly.
RepMalliotakis,Unfortunately today Fort Hamilton High School in #Brooklyn received a third threatening phone call making a bomb threat. I‚Äôve spoken with @NYPD68Pct who‚Äôve informed me they‚Äôre working with the FBI to address the threat &amp; identify the person or persons responsible.
RepMalliotakis,Nicole has been working with @USACEHQ on multiple district projects that she has secured funds for including the East Shore Sea Wall which will soon break ground and dredging in Great Kills Harbor &amp; Hudson River to accommodate recreational boats &amp; cargo ships.
