SenatorWicker,As I wrote in @WSJOpinion last year @POTUS should come out and say it and ensure we are making the investments necessary to deter China from invading Taiwan.‚ÄØ 
SenatorWicker,President Biden continues to muddy the waters on whether the U.S. will help defend Taiwan. It‚Äôs not helpful.
SenatorWicker,Many on the left are now admitting that Democrat spending stoked inflation. Yet @POTUS remains in denial. Until he takes responsibility for this crisis and shifts course we will all quite literally be paying the price for his mistakes. #WickerReport 
SenatorWicker,Polling consistently shows that Americans believe @POTUS is missing the mark on every issue including crime immigration and inflation. He needs to adjust his policies to address these pressing concerns.‚ÄØ 
SenatorWicker,.@POTUS is wrong to fight for the end of Title 42 without a plan to protect our border If this measure is overturned we can expect an even more disastrous situation.‚ÄØ 
SenatorWicker,Finland and Sweden would bring strong militaries to the table for @NATO. Allowing accession for these countries to the alliance is in the national interest.‚ÄØ 
SenatorWicker,The WHO‚Äôs new abortion guidelines are dangerous and extreme. I joined @SenHydeSmith @RepMichaelGuest and my colleagues urging the WHO to withdraw these far-reaching rules. 
SenatorWicker,.@POTUS and his party should have foreseen the inflation their spending policies would cause. But even as prices began to soar last fall @POTUS refused to face reality saying the inflation was ‚Äútransitory.‚Äù #WickerReport 
SenatorWicker,Sticker shock is real. It is hard to believe prices have risen so incredibly high. It seems we have escaped the pandemic only to be stuck in the mire of a Biden inflation crisis. #WickerReport 
SenatorWicker,Last weekend marked the return of the Pass Christian Blessing of the Fleet. Dating back over 80 years this annual tradition sends boats off for the beginning of shrimp season.  #MississippiMondayüì∏: Pass Christian Main Street 
SenatorWicker,Out-of-control inflation is starting to slow our economy. As we enter the summer we are still worlds away from the recovery @POTUS promised. #WickerReport 
SenatorWicker,The Biden administration gave us record inflation coupled with an inadequate defense budget this year.  We should fund our Department of Defense at 3% REAL growth and this is the way to do it.  H/T @meaglen from @AEI.
SenatorWicker,This time last year we were paying $2.70 for a gallon of gas in Mississippi. Today we are paying over $4 per gallon taking a huge bite out of our budgets. #WickerReport 
SenatorWicker,Gas prices are hitting previously unimaginable prices. President Biden can end this sticker shock at the pump if he stops waging a war on American energy.
SenatorWicker,This weekend marks the start of National Safe Boating week. As Co-Chair of the Congressional Boating caucus I wish all Mississippians a safe and responsible weekend on the water. #NSBW
SenatorWicker,Today is #NationalArmedForcesDay. We celebrate and honor all of those who have donned the uniform in defense of our great nation. 
SenatorWicker,President Biden‚Äôs approval now sits at a dismal 39 percent. Americans across the aisle do not want the radical direction he is taking our country in.
SenatorWicker,Today just as in 1949 our foreign policy should serve the practical interests of the American people. Opening NATO to Finland and Sweden would help deter future conflict with Russia and serve our strategic interests in the world. My latest in @NRO:
SenatorWicker,The Black Sea is a vital gateway to global trade. It is undoubtedly in the American interest to ensure Russia does not seize control of it.
SenatorWicker,This week I met with Gen. Chris Cavoli the nominee to serve as our next commander of @US_EUCOM and Supreme Allied Commander Europe. I was glad to discuss the critical national security priorities that face our forces on the continent. 
SenatorWicker,Gas could hit a whopping six dollars per gallon by the end of this summer. This is enormously harmful to our country. 
SenatorWicker,Baby formula continues to disappear from our shelves. I joined @SenMikeLee on a measure aiming to ease this supply chain crisis.
SenatorWicker,President Biden is not just letting illegal immigrants run roughshod over our border but his inaction is also leading to a morale crisis for those who watch over our southern border. We need to improve conditions for our border patrol agents. 
SenatorWicker,The Americas are a cornerstone of our national security economic prosperity and commitment to the rule of law. Deepening regional ties at @OAS_official through this legislation would prove an important step in securing a better future for our hemisphere.
SenatorWicker,Parents are struggling to feed their newborns because baby formula has disappeared from the shelves. Congress needs to act quickly. I am pleased to cosponsor legislation that would provide relief and allow more product to reach the market.
SenatorWicker,Today the Senate passed $40 billion in defensive aid for Ukraine by an overwhelming majority. This vote sends a signal to Vladimir Putin that America will proudly stand with our friends. Ukraine is on the embattled frontier of freedom. They deserve our unwavering support.
SenatorWicker,The Disinformation Board was always a heavy-handed and radical creation intended to punish conservative Americans. I am glad to see President Biden give up on this project.
SenatorWicker,China and Russia continue to aid each other in efforts to create a new age of authoritarianism. Congress and @POTUS must be clear eyed about these threats and how they are connected. 
SenatorWicker,Fentanyl overdoses are skyrocketing. Americans are dying. These are the consequences of an open border that President Biden chooses not to control.
SenatorWicker,Taiwan is an indispensable trading partner vibrant democracy and important ally in the Indo-Pacific. I joined @SenateForeign and my colleagues on a letter affirming that Taiwan must be a part of @POTUS‚Äô Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.
SenatorWicker,The cost of living has been a top concern for the American public for months. @POTUS claims his chief priority is to get prices under control but he continues pushing failed policies that will hurt taxpayers.
SenatorWicker,Last week my colleagues and I sent a letter to the heads of @USOPM @USGSA and @OMBPress about the need to reopen government offices. Constituents need access to federal services and it is time for the federal workforce to return to the office.
SenatorWicker,Seaman First Class John Melton of Liberty MS was tragically killed at Pearl Harbor. Our Navy recently recovered and identified his remains. It is now proper that we honor Seaman Melton for his heroic service during one of the moments we needed it most.  
SenatorWicker,This morning I met with representatives from the Mississippi Petroleum Marketers &amp; Convenience Store Association. Their work to combat the CDL driver shortage is vital during this supply chain crisis. 
SenatorWicker,Rising gas prices are crushing the American people‚Äôs paychecks. With inflation and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine the government should encourage domestic production instead of pursuing President Biden‚Äôs relentless war on American energy.  
SenatorWicker,Superior hypersonic missile technology will be crucial to effectively deterring China. We need more successful testing like this ‚Äì and fast.
SenatorWicker,It was good to welcome so many interns and constituents to the Capitol this #MississippiMorning. I am glad to see students once again getting the opportunity to spend a summer with us. 
SenatorWicker,The question today for every American is this: Are we better off now than we were before President Biden took office?  More and more Americans are answering with a clear ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù 
SenatorWicker,As Congress prepares to fund the military I will be pushing for a major boost to Navy shipbuilding along with the sale of high-tech weapons to Taiwan. This could be pivotal in preventing the next great conflict. #WickerReport
SenatorWicker,Finland brings a strong array of military and defensive capabilities to @NATO. We should carry the alliance‚Äôs momentum and new unity forward by accepting this important ally right away.
SenatorWicker,Yesterday I met with Mississippi representatives from the @alzassociation. This year I am once again supporting funding for groundbreaking Alzheimer‚Äôs research and I look forward to more progress as we fight to end this disease. 
SenatorWicker,Drug trafficking theft and violent crime are on the rise across the country. Americans feel less safe in their own communities. This is not the future we want.
SenatorWicker,The Biden Administration is allowing our Navy to weaken as compared to China. @POTUS‚Äô recent defense budget and 30-year shipbuilding plan would lead to U.S. naval decline with too few destroyers and amphibious transport ships.#WickerReport
