RepCarlos,No American â€“ much less a child â€“ should ever fear being at school their place of worship or in their own home. These heinous acts of violence are symptoms of a deeper social ill. It takes all of us to overcome this. Lourdes and I are praying for the victims and their families.
RepCarlos,The baby formula shortage should have never happened in the first place from the second the FDA and the Biden administration knew a factory was closing there should have been contingency plans. From crisis to crisis this administration is nothing but incompetent. 
RepCarlos,Two straight weeks of record-high gas prices. Working families are being crushed under the weight of Bidenâ€™s inflation.
RepCarlos,
RepCarlos,May is #SkinCancerAwarenessMonth a cause that is very important to me. Iâ€™m proud to support legislation that supports sun safety for children and encourages lawmakers to ease restrictions on sunscreens in schools.Â Â For more information on how to reduce your risk:
RepCarlos,It was a pleasure to join Lourdes over the weekend at The @childrenstrust service project showcase. These young people's leadership is inspiring and with the support of the Trust they are making a real difference in Miami-Dade County. #FL26 
RepCarlos,On #ArmedForcesDay we thank and honor the men and women in all branches of the U.S. military for their brave sacrifice to serve our country. Today and every day I salute you. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ 
RepCarlos,Proud to cosponsor this legislation that would provide critical support to our HSI officers that investigate and stop transnational criminal activity coming through our border. HSI officers play a huge role in our national security which must always remain a top priority. 
RepCarlos,Hoy celebramos el aniversario 120 del nacimiento de la RepÃºblica libre de #Cuba. Pero hoy el pueblo cubano sigue su lucha mientras el rÃ©gimen asesino Castrista continÃºa oprimiendo sistemÃ¡ticamente a un pueblo inocente. Nunca detendrÃ© mi compromiso con una #CubaLibre #PatriaYVida 
RepCarlos,It shocks no one Biden would waver in his commitment to keep #Cuba #Nicaragua and #Venezuela out of the Summit of the Americas. Under Biden Latin Americaâ€™s dictators get a pass while freedom fighters are left out to dry.Es una desgracia y una vergÃ¼enza total. Que pena.
RepCarlos,This week I had the great honor of attending @TheCHLI 18th annual gala and speaking with many of my good friends and colleagues. Specifically @LincolnDBalart who has contributed immensely in bringing awareness to the interests and advancement of our Hispanic community. 
RepCarlos,If Biden would actually visit the border for once just as we have several times in the past two years maybe heâ€™d learn a thing or two about how his disastrous policies are causing this border crisis.America will be left weaker because of his decision to end Title 42. 
RepCarlos,Bidenâ€™s weakness emboldens others to act against Americaâ€™s interests.Under his failed leadership Mexico has been more of an enemy than a partner by exploiting Bidenâ€™s border crisis and cozying up to communists in #Cuba.My op-ed on @FoxNews:
RepCarlos,Under Bidenâ€™s failed leadership America is looking more and more like Cuba and Venezuela. Inflation broken supply chains threats of Ministry of Truths unsecured borders incompetent leadership.
RepCarlos,Never listen to what the Biden administration says only what they do. This is Bidenâ€™s America: 
RepCarlos,Well looks like it took Biden and Mayorkas 3 whole weeks to realize the American people weren't going to stand for a Ministry of Truth governing and monitoring our speech.Fidel Castro's tactics won't work here in America. Never have never will.
