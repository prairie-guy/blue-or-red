RepDavid,Last week gas prices in Phoenix and Scottsdale hit an average of over $5 a gallon. That‚Äôs the highest recorded average in the state‚Äôs history. When will the Biden Administration realize their failed energy policies have made this crisis worse? 
RepDavid,The border crisis continues to get worse. In April alone there were over 234000 illegal encounters which is a record high. This Administration must do more to secure our southern border and end this out of control crisis. 
RepDavid,Armed Forces Day presents our nation the opportunity to recognize thank and honor the men and women who serve in our military‚Äôs five branches. Please join me in thanking all the brave soldiers in the U.S. armed forces! 
RepDavid,Americans should be able to freely choose how they invest in their own 401(k) retirement accounts. The federal government should have no say in the matter. I am proud to support @RepDonaldsPress bill that protects this vital retirement option. 
RepDavid,There are solutions that exist to so many of our country‚Äôs problems. But it takes a willing Congress to accept them and realize that ‚ÄúBig Government solutions‚Äù are never the answer. 
RepDavid,Democrats just passed a bill giving the President authority to arbitrarily cap prices for gas - which functionally gives Joe Biden state-run economy powers. Make no mistake about it this is a socialist ploy that will only make matters worse. 
RepDavid,The Democrats have spent decades trying to upend American energy policy. Now 16 months into their unified control of government they have functionally torn it to pieces. 
RepDavid,This is unbelievable. Gas in Phoenix and Scottsdale is over $ùüì per gallon on average. We are paying more at the pump because of Joe Biden's failed energy policies. 
RepDavid,It was an honor to join @GOPLeader today in receiving an award for our work in this area. 
RepDavid,Curing Valley Fever has been a top priority of mine since I began serving in Congress. I am proud to see how far research and development of vaccines and treatments have come for fungal diseases but I know we have a long way to go in this fight.
