USRepLong,@JoeBiden colluded with @NSBAPublicEd who wanted the @NationalGuard to deploy to school districts to control parents opposed to #CRT. Under his direction @DHSgov formed the #MinistryOfTruth. These actions are more akin to @KremlinRussia_E than the leader of the #FreeWorld.
USRepLong,"@pdoocy nails it again! ""Why are we giving resources to illegals under @JoeBiden when Americans struggle to buy things that were plentiful under #Trump like #Gas and #BabyFormula?""Source:  "
USRepLong,"The only thing that's ""incredible"" about @JoeBiden's transition to #GoingGreen is how incredibly bad it's been for America.Under #BidensLeadership we went from energy prosperity to begging totalitarian regimes like @NicolasMaduro &amp; @OPECSecretariat for #Oil "
USRepLong,#Title42 helped protect against:✅340000 pounds of drugs in FY22✅5300 pounds of #Fentanyl✅Thousands/millions of new potential #COVID cases Ending Title 42 weakens #NationalSecurity. Ask yourself why would the @POTUS and #Democrats want to diminish national security?
USRepLong,List of False Conspiracy Theories Promoted by #Democrats:✅#TrumpAlfaBank✅#SteeleDossier✅#HunterBiden's Laptop is #RussianPropagandaDemocrats like @HillaryClinton who spread these lies need to be held accountable.
USRepLong,We have way too many problems here at home that have our people struggling for me to have even considered voting to send $40 Billion to #Ukraine. I was a no. I was in the minority as was @HawleyMO in the Senate. The only question now is when will they be back for more?
USRepLong,@JoeBiden wants to line the pockets of the #Venezuelan dictator and #Narco-terrorist @NicolasMaduro by easing sanctions on #VenezuelanOil instead of drilling here in the U.S.! #DrillBabyDrill
USRepLong,#Democrats just passed their socialistic #GasPriceFixing bill with #PriceFixing regulations on the #FreeMarket. Have they forgotten how well #OilAndGas price controls worked in the 70s? Back then #GasRationing lead to mile-long lines. #StopTheMadness @HouseCommerce @GOP 
USRepLong,This Week's 'Long's Short Report' is Really Short- Short on Everything. This week I cover the ongoing baby formula shortage and the Biden Administration's slow attempts to solve it.  
USRepLong,I'm co-sponsoring @cathymcmorris's initiative #TheBabiesNeedFormulaNowAct to expand #BabyFormula availability hold the @US_FDA accountable and reduce barriers to increase new market competition.
USRepLong,The #Democrats just passed gas 'er I mean their #SocialistGasPriceFixingAct. Get ready for #GasRationing.
USRepLong,"If there's one 1 theme to @JoeBiden &amp; #Democrat leadership it's: ""Our policies aren't to blame. It's someone else's fault."" @FTC has investigated gas ""#PriceGouging"" numerous times over the decades and found that price hikes are inherent to the market like any other market."
USRepLong,The forming and deforming of the #DisinformationGovernanceBoard appears to be in lockstep with @elonmusk's deal to acquire @Twitter. This is scarier than initially thought because it indicates @JoeBiden/gov is actively working to control the #media.
USRepLong,#Democrats are once again throwing money at a problem they helped create. I will vote 'no' on #HR7790 which grants $28 million for the #BabyFormulaCrisis b/c it doesn't specify how the funds will solve the problem. The solution lies with @JoeBiden &amp; @US_FDA  doing their job.
USRepLong,I want to thank Ron Leone of the #Missouri #Petroleum Marketers &amp; Convenience Association and @JgreerGreer of @mfaoil for stopping by my office today. Their dedicated service is appreciated during this #EnergyCrisis. 
USRepLong,#Trump's enactment of #Title42 saved thousands of lives by slowing the spread of #COVID &amp; by curbing the flow of #fentanyl into the #US. I'm proud to co-sponsor #HR6531 which allows #Title42 to be used for fentanyl/other drugs which are the leading cause of death for 18-45 y/o.
USRepLong,@JoeBiden's #GoingGreen agenda and his habit of printing money we don't have for his spending sprees are 2 huge contributing factors to his record-breaking #inflation. This #BrokenRecord routine of blaming #Putin or #Democrat mandated #COVID shutdowns won't solve the problem.
