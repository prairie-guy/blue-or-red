SenBillCassidy,Happy to join this letter telling @StateDept to rescind grants to organizations that seek to demonize #Israel. Taxpayer money should not be used to harass one of our greatest allies.
SenBillCassidy,To be clear keeping Title 42 does not solve the border crisis it just prevented the Biden admin from making it worse.We still have a crisis. We still need the admin to step up and secure the border.
SenBillCassidy,We all have loved ones affected by mental illness. This Mental Health Awareness Month we are looking forward to a new way for those at risk to access mental care.
SenBillCassidy,@MrsTFitzy Here is my plan to lower prices at the pump &amp; cut bureaucratic red-tape.
SenBillCassidy,We have record-breaking gas prices. Experts say gas could hit $6/gallon by the end of the summer.It's clear we need to unleash domestic production. We need an Energy Operation Warp Speed to lower prices at the pump.
SenBillCassidy,Inflation is crushing the middle class.
SenBillCassidy,- Philippians 4:6 
SenBillCassidy,You can watch the full discussion here.
SenBillCassidy,6/6 working to get signed into law: 
SenBillCassidy,"5/6 Also signed into law: ""Authorize a grant program for racial and ethnic bias training for health care providers; Create a study on best practices for teaching within health professional training programs to reduce and prevent discrimination."" "
SenBillCassidy,"4/6 ""Cassidy’s bill to reinforce research on minority health disparities signed into law...The goals of NIMHD’s Research Endowment Program include promoting minority health and health disparities research capacity and infrastructure."" "
SenBillCassidy,3/6 “If that’s as far as you read you’d think Cassidy doesn’t care about Black women dying during pregnancy or in childbirth…But that is not the case.”
SenBillCassidy,2/6 Minority health disparity is a real issue we need to address and fake news and false outrage hurt our ability to make progress.
SenBillCassidy,1/6 Individuals are cutting off &amp; misquoting my statements highlighting minority health disparities to create a malicious &amp; fake narrative. My entire conversation was about my work to address racial bias in healthcare &amp; address high maternal mortality among African American moms: 
SenBillCassidy,Thankful for all those who sacrifice so much to keep our country safe. #ArmedForcesDay 
SenBillCassidy,BREAKING: A Louisiana judge just halted Biden's disastrous plan to make the border crisis worse by repealing Title 42. We need to give Border Patrol the tools they need to secure the border not take them away. Proud to say I supported Judge Summerhays’ nomination.
SenBillCassidy,Secure the border.
SenBillCassidy,The Biden administration's all-out assault on American energy is hurting families at home and at the pump. 
SenBillCassidy,No mom should have to fear whether or not she will have enough formula for her child. The Biden administration knew the shortage was coming but they did nothing. #babyformula #formulashortage
SenBillCassidy,Louisiana energy &gt; Venezuela oil
SenBillCassidy,A night to celebrate the achievements of young men and women of Hammond High School was disrupted by senseless violence. Monitoring the situation as more details become available and praying for the well-being of those injured.
SenBillCassidy,Met this week with Dr. Ahmad Sarmast founder of Afghanistan National Institute of Music which we helped escape the Taliban. From exile in Portugal Sarmast and his school are a beacon of hope keeping the dream of a free #Afghanistan alive.  
SenBillCassidy,Retweet to tell @JoeBiden to stop asking Venezuela to pump more oil and allow American Energy to go to work. 
SenBillCassidy,The U.S. has the best environmental standards for developing oil &amp; gas in the world. So why would the Biden administration rather have Venezuela pump more oil instead of putting Americans to work? 
SenBillCassidy,These are the countries the Biden administration is asking to produce oil as opposed to us. If you're concerned about climate you should be producing in Louisiana. 
SenBillCassidy,President Biden’s administration is actively making high gas prices worse. We need an Operation Warp Speed for domestic production to unleash American energy.
SenBillCassidy,Just had a great conversation with @guypbenson on our need for an Energy Operation Warp Speed—thanks for having me on.
SenBillCassidy,.@POTUS needs to think about the American people first. Families cannot afford a tank of gas. 
SenBillCassidy,Any discussion with the Maduro dictatorship should start with the liberation of Tomeu Vadell of the @FreeCitgo6 and the other Americans held hostage by the regime. Maduro must release them now. #FreeTomeuVadell #Venezuela
SenBillCassidy,energy security = national security
