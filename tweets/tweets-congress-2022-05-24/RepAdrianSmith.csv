RepAdrianSmith,Thanks to my Republican colleagues for co-signing my letter and standing up for American consumers. I'm especially grateful every @WaysandMeansGOP member signed on. @RepKevinBrady @VernBuchanan @MikeKellyPA @RepJasonSmith @RepTomRice @RepDavid @RepWalorski @RepLaHood
RepAdrianSmith,Proposals to raise taxes on energy producers will only increase costs for hardworking families who are already feeling the #BidenPriceHike. President Biden's energy crisis is costing families which is why I sent a letter to Secretary Yellen opposing a windfall profits tax. 
RepAdrianSmith,The last thing job creators need is more red tape. That's why I reintroduced the bipartisan Commonsense Reporting Act to streamline health coverage reporting requirements for employers.Thanks to @RepThompson for partnering with me on the House version of this legislation!
RepAdrianSmith,Yesterday I enjoyed a productive discussion about workforce recruitment higher education and health care priorities with @SiouxlndChamber members. 
RepAdrianSmith,This weekend I welcomed veterans from the Nebraska Panhandle to Washington. Our nation owes our veterans a debt of gratitude for their service.
