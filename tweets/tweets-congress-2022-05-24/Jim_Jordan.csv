Jim_Jordan,Last week we learned:-Hillary Clinton ordered the dissemination of the Trump/Alfa Bank hoax.-President Biden thanked NSBA for writing a letter targeting parents at school board meetings.-And Democrats think men can get pregnant.Can’t make it up.
Jim_Jordan,#NEWS: “Top Republicans query FBI on warrantless wiretapping of Americans”w/ @RepMikeTurner 
Jim_Jordan,“Biden's failed immigration policies turned every state into a border state”@SteveScalise @RepBentz 
Jim_Jordan,Ever think you’d see $5 gas in America?
Jim_Jordan,God Bless Cpl. Charles Hiltibran and his family. Thank you President Trump for negotiating his remains be turned over by North Korea. 
Jim_Jordan,Just another reminder:Attorney General Garland still hasn’t rescinded his memo which allows DOJ to spy on parents at school board meetings.
Jim_Jordan,Ohio’s job market grew faster than the national average in April. Great news for the Buckeye State! 
Jim_Jordan,-The Biden DOJ targeted parents at school board meetings. -The Biden IRS leaked American tax returns. -The Biden FBI surveilled your internet data. -The Biden DOD botched its Afghanistan withdrawal. -The Biden DHS created a border crisis.  And it’s only year two.
Jim_Jordan,President Biden called and thanked Viola Garcia and the NSBA for their letter targeting parents at school board meetings. Collusion! 
Jim_Jordan,Ask yourself this:Would gas prices be this high if President Trump were in office?Would inflation? Would there be baby formula on the shelves?
Jim_Jordan,Hillary Clinton a former Secretary of State United States Senator and Presidential hopeful approved dissemination of the Trump-Alfa Bank hoax. And barely anyone in the mainstream media is talking about it.
Jim_Jordan,Unacceptable. Support our great Ohio police families!

Jim_Jordan,GOP Leaders React to NSBA Investigation w/@GOPLeader @virginiafoxx @RepJamesComer 
Jim_Jordan,Despite it all America is still the greatest country in the world.
Jim_Jordan,Gas prices are at record highs but don’t worry Democrats think you can just go buy a $50000 electric car.
Jim_Jordan,The same people who wanted to create a “disinformation board” also think that men can get pregnant. Can’t make it up.
Jim_Jordan,The FBI “concluded there was no substance” to the Trump-Alfa Bank allegations. But Democrats continued to push it anyway. 
Jim_Jordan,Economists now expect $6 dollar gas by August. Inflation isn’t getting any better. Baby formula is still out of stock. Joe Biden’s America!
Jim_Jordan,2% of Americans think the economy is “excellent.”17% think it’s “good.”34% think it’s “not so good.”46% think it’s “poor.”Have we ever seen numbers this bad?
Jim_Jordan,Must watch with @ClayTravis and @seanhannity. 
Jim_Jordan,CNN+ lasted longer than Joe Biden’s “Disinformation Board.” Reacting to that and more with @seanhannity and @ClayTravis shortly. Tune in to Fox News now!
Jim_Jordan,Democrats’ solution to the baby formula shortage? Give a 23 million dollar raise to the bureaucrats at the FDA who created the problem. Makes sense!
Jim_Jordan,Today’s Left. 
Jim_Jordan,
Jim_Jordan,Huge win for Free Speech! 
Jim_Jordan,It's about intimidation. 
Jim_Jordan,God Bless Justice Thomas. 
Jim_Jordan,
