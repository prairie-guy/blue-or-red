RepGuthrie,.@LEX18News reports that the Russian government has banned me from entering Russia. Glad to see the Kremlin knows where I stand on Putin’s unlawful immoral invasion of Ukraine. I'm proud to sanction Russia and their oil industry which funds their war machine against Ukraine. 
RepGuthrie,I’m happy to see a federal judge pause the Biden Administration’s plan to end the Title 42 border policy. Biden Administration refuses to use all the tools at its disposal to secure our border. We must secure the border &amp; stop illicit fentanyl trafficking. 
RepGuthrie,This week I met with Kentuckians with @alzassociation. We need to find a cure to Alzheimer’s and other diseases that have no cures. That’s why as GOP Leader of @housecommerce’s Health Subcommittee I look for ways to spur innovation cut through red tape and promote research. 
RepGuthrie,It’s inexcusable that the Biden Administration allowed the baby formula shortage to become a crisis with no backup plan. I'm supporting the Babies Need More Formula Now Act to address the crisis now for KY families &amp; help ensure this doesn't happen again.
RepGuthrie,ICYMI: Disinformation Governance Board also known as the “Ministry of Truth” has been paused. I'm glad our concerns were heard. I'll continue to hold this administration accountable for any actions that could undermine our civil liberties and privacy. 
RepGuthrie,It’s past time for the Biden Administration to reverse their hostile polices on our own energy production and work with Republicans on unleashing American energy to help families struggling to pay for these record high gas prices.
RepGuthrie,Facts:➡️CEOs of oil companies testified under oath there is no price gouging➡️President Biden’s Energy Secretary testified that she did not believe “anyone is saying there is wholesale gouging”➡️Biden Administration is not currently prosecuting oil companies for price gouging
RepGuthrie,Democrats are claiming oil and gas companies are price gouging to distract from their failed policies that have made us vulnerable to dictators for our energy needs and that have hindered our own energy production. 
RepGuthrie,@HouseCommerce Learn more about the Substance Use Prevention Treatment and Recovery Services Block Grant Act I'm co-leading which is part of @cathymcmorris's bill to bolster mental health resources &amp; the FDA Act that includes my Pre-approval Information Exchange Act: 
RepGuthrie,Today my bills passed out of @housecommerce that would:➡️deliver treatment prevention and recovery support services➡️help patients access medical innovation more quickly➡️reauthorize user fees secure our medical supply chain and lower drug costs
