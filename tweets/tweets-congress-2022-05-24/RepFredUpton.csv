RepFredUpton,Today I joined @EPA Regional Administrator Debra Shore for a progress report regarding removing the lead pipes in Benton Harbor. It was good to hear from local crews and supervisors and hear firsthand about the life-saving work they’re doing. 
RepFredUpton,It was a pleasure to join the @GREconClub today for a good discussion with my friends @RepDebDingell and Hank Meijer. Always happy to see the good folks of West Michigan who are focused on solving problems. 
RepFredUpton,Expanding peer support helps connect those with shared experiences to offer support – something especially important for our veterans. Research and real-world evidence has shown that by doing so we can save thousands from suffering in silence and suicide. 
RepFredUpton,ARPA-H like DARPA would focus on groundbreaking health and medical research that may be too risky for the private sector. The successes achieved under ARPA-H will save millions of Americans at an unprecedented rate.
