RepTedBudd,Happy #MeckDecDay North Carolina! On May 20 1775 a group of citizens from Mecklenburg County declared independence from Great Britain.This historic signing happened more than a year before the U.S. Declaration of Independence. #FirstInFreedom 
RepTedBudd,The current baby formula shortage is unacceptable.It's another example of the Biden administrationâ€™s mismanagement hurting North Carolina families.I just voted to cut federal red tape to help solve this crisis.
