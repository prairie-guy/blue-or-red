RepStefanik,Congratulations to @StLawrenceU’s Class of 2022!
RepStefanik,Today I had a call with the New York Rural Letter Carrier’s Union to discuss my work to support the critical work of our postal workers. I will always work to ensure our #NY21 communities have access to this essential service! @NRLCA
RepStefanik,Joe Biden owns this baby formula crisis.
RepStefanik,The Upward Bound program will support local #NY21 high school students attending @SUNYPlattsburgh and @SUNYADK!
RepStefanik,#NY21 families can no longer afford Biden’s anti-energy agenda.
RepStefanik,“Stefanik has proved she is effective and assertive through her work with small businesses her critique on the vaccine mandate extension and her role of asserting new energy to the upstate region.”Thank you Alexandria Cresci from Sauquoit for your kind words in @UR_Sentinel👇 
RepStefanik,Make no mistake – Joe Biden NEVER should have let the baby formula crisis reach this point. Shelves are still empty in #NY21.
RepStefanik,Right now the average price for a gallon of gas in New York is $4.93. One year ago it was $3.07. 
RepStefanik,CRT does NOT belong in New York schools.
RepStefanik,The average price of a gallon of gas is on track to surpass $6 nationwide by August. The #BidenPriceHike is devastating for EVERY #NY21 family.
RepStefanik,After experiencing a loss of adequate access to a safe water supply this investment will secure reliable access for the Town of Schuyler Falls. #NY21
RepStefanik,Since Biden took office his open border policies have incentivized OVER 2.6 MILLION illegal immigrants to cross our southern border. Ending Title 42 will only make this crisis WORSE.
RepStefanik,As a new mother I know how important it is for families to have certainty for their babies. Last week I voted to advance legislation and introduced solutions to address the #BabyFormulaCrisis NOW provide accountability for @US_FDA and ensure this crisis NEVER happens again.
RepStefanik,As warmer weather returns to the North Country and the boating season returns remember to be safe! #NY21
RepStefanik,Reminder – the @nypost reported on Hunter Biden’s business dealings in 2020. But Big Tech and the Main Stream Media colluded to stop the American people from knowing the truth.
RepStefanik,This week I introduced and advanced SOLUTIONS to address Biden’s #BabyFormulaCrisis. Here’s a look into my week working for #NY21 families 👇👇👇
RepStefanik,America is NOT a third world country. But under Joe Biden’s failed leadership families can’t find baby formula for their babies.
RepStefanik,Today on #ArmedForcesDay join me in honoring our Armed Forces for defending this great nation. To the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces – including the 10th Mountain Division – thank you for your service and sacrifice at home and abroad. 🇺🇸🇺🇸 
RepStefanik,“Stefanik’s “New Yorkers first” motto will definitely work to unify the region and bring home resources needed for jobs manufacturing and agriculture.” I will always bring the concerns of #NY21 to the highest levels! MORE in @mylittlefalls:
RepStefanik,When the baby formula plant in Sturgis Michigan closed I quickly demanded the @US_FDA take action to address the impending baby formula crisis.  Families are in crisis because Biden’s FDA ignored this warning. There must be accountability.
RepStefanik,Make no mistake – Russia and China are our foreign adversaries. My legislation will halt taxpayer funds going to colleges and universities who in any way contribute to their military capabilities. 
RepStefanik,With America in crisis it is no surprise two in ten Americans disapprove of Joe Biden’s failed leadership. This is the lowest approval rating of his presidency!📉📉📉
RepStefanik,I am working to protect U.S. taxpayer dollars from benefitting adversaries like Russia or China. Learn more about the Halting Academic Liaisons to our Adversaries Act 👇👇👇
RepStefanik,This baby formula crisis is heartbreaking and it never should have gotten to this point. #NY21 families are the reason that I have been leading the charge for answers and solutions to address this crisis. 
RepStefanik,As the brave Iranian people take to the streets to protest against Ali Khamenei &amp; his regime - I want to reiterate my support for the Iranian people! It's time for @POTUS to stand with the Iranian people over the Mullah’s and their terrorist regime. #IranProtests
RepStefanik,Nancy Pelosi and Democrats' bill will do nothing but throw more money at the FDA. It will not get baby formula on shelves. I am proud to lead legislation to address the #BabyFormulaCrisis IMMEDIATELY and ensure this crisis NEVER happens again.
RepStefanik,Hunter Biden made MILLIONS off of his business dealings with Communist China.  We must investigate the Biden Crime Family as a matter of national security.
RepStefanik,Secretary Mayorkas has failed at his number one job: SECURING the border. 
RepStefanik,The Biden administration's decision to pause their Communist “Ministry of Truth” is a WIN for FREE SPEECH! We must continue to expose their shredding of the Constitution.
RepStefanik,I have been proud to secure funding for #NY21 Essential Air Services every year. Now this essential service will continue at Ogdensburg and Plattsburgh. #RESULTS for #NY21 👇👇👇 
RepStefanik,There must be accountability for Biden’s @US_FDA’s horrific handling of the baby formula crisis.
RepStefanik,The Biden administration owns this baby formula crisis. 
RepStefanik,Republicans have offered real SOLUTIONS to address this #babyformulacrisis NOW.  We will have accountability and answers for the families who have been forced to panic. 
RepStefanik,Today I met with #NY21 members of @unitedeggprod from Chazy to discuss important issues in the agriculture industry including food safety labeling and our agriculture workforce. 
RepStefanik,Law enforcement and first responders endure incredible risks to keep our communities safe.I am proud to advance legislation to provide them with critical mental health support.
RepStefanik,I have led the charge to demand @US_FDA to address the baby formula supply issue since February. They failed to respond substantively to me until LAST WEEK. There must be accountability. 
RepStefanik,House Democrats’ Socialist Energy Price Fixing Act will only worsen the energy crisis facing American families. Instead the Biden administration needs to end its war on American energy and unleash our energy DOMINANCE to ease this historic pain at the pump.
RepStefanik,Far-Left Democrats will stop at nothing to push an abortion until birth agenda that is wildly radical out of step with the American people and an outlier on the world stage. An unborn child is a human life.  Pass it on.
RepStefanik,Proud to vote in support of this bill to help address #BidensBabyFormulaCrisis 
RepStefanik,After Joe Biden and House Democrats refused to acknowledge the #BabyFormulaCrisis we finally took a step forward to address Biden’s baby formula shortage and protect families from future supply chain shortages.
RepStefanik,As a new mother I know how important it is for families to have certainty when feeding their babies. I am proud to lead the Babies Need Formula Now Act with @cathymcmorris @repashleyhinson and @repbice to address Joe Biden’s baby formula crisis.
RepStefanik,While Joe Biden’s @US_FDA has ignored my calls to address the #BabyFormulaCrisis I have introduced SOLUTIONS to ensure this never happens again.
RepStefanik,President Biden is breaking all the wrong records.
RepStefanik,🚨📻I'll be joining @BoSnerdley on @77WABCradio at 4:45 PM.LISTEN IN👇👇👇 
RepStefanik,It is past time to erase Democrats’ sham impeachment smear against President Trump’s name. President Trump was rightfully acquitted and this political witch hunt from Nancy Pelosi must be expunged! 
RepStefanik,I am proud to lead this effort to include the rest of Saratoga County and all of Washington County in the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area. My bipartisan legislation will help preserve and promote the rich history of the area! #NY21
RepStefanik,Gas prices have never been higher. Joe Biden’s Far-Left agenda is to blame for these skyrocketing prices.
RepStefanik,Today I met with members of the North Country Chamber of Commerce and local #NY21 organizations to hear their concerns and discuss my work to fully restore Northern Border travel &amp; deliver federal grants including through the Northern Border Regional Commission. #NY21 
RepStefanik,Remarkable double “red rainbow” sighting in Lewis County this weekend!  Nothing compares to the beauty of the North Country! #NY21
RepStefanik,Today I joined @HarrisFaulkner to discuss the baby formula shortage and the #BidenBorderCrisis. #BehindtheScenes WATCH HERE →  
RepStefanik,While Twitter has banned Donald Trump dangerous Iranian officials are still allowed to spread their Anti-Semitic message of hate and violence.  I’m calling on @elonmusk to address the concerning presence of the terrorist Iranian regime on the platform.
RepStefanik,🚨📺Tune in to @foxnews as I join @HARRISFAULKNER on @FaulknerFocus at 11:00 AM. Make sure to TUNE IN!
RepStefanik,Ambush-style attacks on our law enforcement are up 56% compared to this time in 2020. As the Far-Left calls to defund our nation's police I will always #BackTheBlue.
