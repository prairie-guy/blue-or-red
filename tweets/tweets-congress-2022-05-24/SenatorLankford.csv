SenatorLankford,It is an unspeakable evil what happened in Uvalde TX today. What would drive a teenager to kill their grandmother and then shoot innocent children? Cindy and I are holding the families in our prayers as they face this ruthless act.
SenatorLankford,International agreements do not have the force of law unless voted on by the Senate. What the @WHO is doing this week has no chance of getting the support of two thirds of the Senate. Our Founders set up a system of checks &amp; balances for a reason.
SenatorLankford,Instead of combatting skyrocketing energy prices Biden &amp; his policies are making matters worse.   Listen to my conversation with Lee on @NEWSRADIOKTOK here ðŸ‘‡ 
SenatorLankford,Service members have the same rights they have honorably sought to serve &amp; protect &amp; shouldnâ€™t be dishonorably discharged or forced into retirement for choosing to not take a vaccine.
SenatorLankford,A US Navy Board stood by Navy Lt. Moseleyâ€™s right to live his faith. I continue to fight for our military members &amp; call on the DoD to respect religious accommodations when it comes to vaccinations.
SenatorLankford,At a time when our nation faces a growing number of daily threats it is irresponsible for the Air Force to remove these airmen without just cause.
SenatorLankford,Forcing our nationâ€™s airmen to get the COVID vaccine is unacceptable unlawful &amp; is a complete disregard for those with sincerely held religious beliefsâ€”service members have the very same rights they have honorably sought to serve &amp; protect.
SenatorLankford,.@WHO is already rightfully under the microscope for corruption &amp; their close ties with the Chinese Communist Party. Any action taken by the WHO should be focused on holding the CCP accountable for causing the pandemic not trying to control the healthcare of any sovereign nation
SenatorLankford,Iâ€™m talking with Lee on @NEWSRADIOKTOKâ€”tune in.
SenatorLankford,All weâ€™re asking the Biden Administration to do is enforce the lawâ€”thatâ€™s what it means to be President of the United States. 
SenatorLankford,To the men &amp; women that serve in our Armed Forcesâ€”thank you for bravely wearing the cloth of our nation &amp; defending us.#NationalArmedForcesDay 
SenatorLankford,Iâ€™m still fighting to make Biden and his team have an actual plan to secure our border! Enforce the law.
SenatorLankford,even the courts agree with me that the Biden Admin policies are arbitrary and wrong. The court action will stop a million of Bidenâ€™s illegal border crossers from coming across our border in the next six weeks. 
SenatorLankford,We're not asking for something crazy. We're just asking for the law to be enforced.#BidenBorderCrisis 
SenatorLankford,I'm astonished that @WHO is attempting to de-humanize unborn children &amp; assert that the rights of the unborn do not exist by categorizing abortions as â€˜self-care.â€™@SenMikeLee &amp; I are urging a reversal on the Organizationâ€™s recent guidelines on abortion.
SenatorLankford,I hope Americans will join me this week in thanking law enforcement officers &amp; remembering those who have given their lives in the line of duty.
SenatorLankford,I am grateful for the men &amp; women that bravely answer the call of duty to protect all of us each &amp; every day. The daily sacrifices that they &amp; their families make cannot be fully understood unless you have put on the badge &amp; walked out the door to serve.
SenatorLankford,Oklahoma law enforcement officers have our back every day. People in our state often stop &amp; thank our officers but during #NationalPoliceWeek we remind law enforcement &amp; their families that we will always have their back as well. 
SenatorLankford,This Administration is literally incentivizing &amp; encouraging people to illegally cross our border. 
SenatorLankford,Bidenâ€™s own team estimates that once Title 42 is lifted a million people will illegally surge across our border in 6 weeksâ€”&amp; they wonâ€™t be turning anyone away at the border.
SenatorLankford,Of the thousands of people coming across our border every day about half are turned around under Title 42. Starting on Monday Biden wants to end Title 42. 
SenatorLankford,Iâ€™m calling on @SecDef to take immediate action &amp; allow US Navy sailors who were denied religious exemptions from the COVID-19 vaccine to return to service.
SenatorLankford,The Biden Admin saw this baby formula crisis coming yet they did nothing to stop the problems it would create for American families.  I am demanding answers from the FDA on their failures that led to this baby formula shortage. 
SenatorLankford,My statement on additional aid to Ukraine: 
SenatorLankford,At this time last year there were 6500 people illegally crossing our border per day. Right now 7800 illegal border crossers are crossing our borders every day with almost a quarter of a million people illegally crossing our border last month. 
SenatorLankford,In just a month gas prices in Oklahoma have jumped over $0.40 a gallon. We are all feeling the effects of skyrocketing energy prices because Biden is unwilling to deal with it. 
SenatorLankford,Last month we saw a quarter of a million people illegally cross our borderâ€”the highest ever for just a month.Iâ€™m not asking the Biden Administration to do anything hard. Iâ€™m just asking them to enforce the law &amp; secure our borders. 
SenatorLankford,Oklahoma farmers &amp; producers are willing &amp; able to feed our nation &amp; the world if weâ€™ll just get the government out of the way &amp; remove the red tape that prevents us from getting food to those affected most by Putinâ€™s war.
SenatorLankford,30 days is more than enough time for the Admin to share their comprehensive plan to address the baby formula crisis with Americans. No parent should be faced with the stress of not knowing if they can find food for their baby.
SenatorLankford,In a public statement this week the Admin admitted that they have known since last year about the formula shortage &amp; the FDA has dragged their feet instead of accelerating the inspection process to re-open the location of the recall.
SenatorLankford,The Biden Admin has another crisis of their own making on their hands.
SenatorLankford,Good morning Oklahoma! Iâ€™m talking with @CoriDuke_KJRH on @KJRH2HD &amp; Haley Williams on @KSWO_7NEWSâ€”tune in.
