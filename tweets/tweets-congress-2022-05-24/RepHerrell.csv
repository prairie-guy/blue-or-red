RepHerrell,Please join me in praying for the families schoolchildren teachers and first responders of Uvalde. 
RepHerrell,Proud to lead this effort to establish oversight and accountability for billions in funds and weaponry the Biden administration is shipping to a foreign conflict. The American people deserve to know whether their tax dollars are going to make the world safer--or more dangerous. 
RepHerrell,A tragic reminder of why the USA has not only a strategic interest in divesting from China but a moral one. Communist gulags are alive and well in 2022. 
RepHerrell,Smugglers human traffickers cartel members violent criminals--and now terrorists are waltzing across our border and often being released into our communities by our own government! 
RepHerrell,I have it on good authority that Alicia's artistic talents are matched by her athletic achievements in Track and Field--hence her nickname. Keep up the great work Zoom Zoom!
RepHerrell,"CONGRATULATIONS to Alicia ""Zoom Zoom"" Jaquez of Lordsburg NM for winning the 2022 Congressional Art Competition for the 2nd District! Her piece ""Mimbres Heritage"" a mesmerizing celebration of Indian artwork and folklore will be seen by thousands of visitors to the US Capitol! "
RepHerrell,Joe Biden's America: where you can't deploy the National Guard to the border but the National School Board Association wants to sic them on concerned parents. Insanity!
RepHerrell,Good news: Title 42 has been preserved again--for now. Americans shouldn't have to beg and plead with their President to enforce the law. We shouldn't have to rely on court orders to protect our communities. But under Joe Biden that's where we are. 
RepHerrell,Proud to be part of this bipartisan fight for New Mexico's agriculture and environment. Thanks for rallying the troops @Rep_Stansbury!
RepHerrell,America returns to work but many federal employees continue pandemic-era telework which Biden wants to make permanent. My SHOW UP Act would restore in-person care for veterans &amp; social security beneficiaries and keep public employees serving the PEOPLE.
RepHerrell,192 Republicans myself included voted against giving $28 million to federal bureaucrats at the FDA to reward them for their failure--it would have done nothing to help families. We support real solutions like the Access to Baby Formula Act &amp; @SenMikeLee's new FORMULA Act. 
RepHerrell,GOP: H.R. 7791 &amp; @SenMikeLee's FORMULA Act fix supply chain issues make it easier for families to get baby formulaDEMS: Pass bill to raise salaries of FDA bureaucrats by $28 millionI support bills that will help not dump more $$$ into the pockets of feds who failed us.
RepHerrell,I am monitoring this situation and working to ensure that first responders and locals whose lands are endangered by this fire have all the resources they need. 
RepHerrell,In addition to the Rio Grande Water Security Act the whole NM delegation is cheer-leading the Water Data Act which will empower our communities to access critical water quality data and protect their health--we must protect our communities from water contaminated by PFAS/PFOA. 
RepHerrell,New Mexico farmers are preparing for reaches of the Rio Grande to dry up this summer. That's why Iâ€™m proud to join @Rep_Stansbury for the bipartisan Rio Grande Water Security Act to improve water management &amp; support water conservation for the Rio Grande Basin.
RepHerrell,No surprise: Pro-Abortion fanatics' ignorance of science extends beyond their inability to recognize a human--they think men can get pregnant!  From sports to biology to abortion why is the Left so eager to erase women? 
RepHerrell,Bye Felicia! 
RepHerrell,"Proud to have co-sponsored legislation that would defund this unconstitutional authoritarian ""Ministry of Truth"" permanently. Looks like enough Americans raised hell that even Joe Biden is realizing his mistake. "
RepHerrell,Outsourcing supply chains manufacturing and vital energy components to China has always been both a moral and strategic mistake.
