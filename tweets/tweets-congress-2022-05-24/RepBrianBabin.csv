RepBrianBabin,As the grandfather to several precious elementary schoolers I’m utterly heartbroken for the families impacted by the tragedy in Uvalde.Roxanne and I are praying God heals those wounded and for the loved ones of those cruelly taken from us. 
RepBrianBabin,Had a wonderful tour of @utmbhealth’s Clear Lake campus this morning. This cutting-edge hospital is serving a critical role in the surrounding community and has top-notch personnel to match. I’m proud countless Texans are being treated at such an outstanding facility! 
RepBrianBabin,You have 2 days left to answer our letter @SecMayorkas. We’re waiting. @repjimbanks 
RepBrianBabin,Catch me @6pm on #spicer&amp;co. @newsmax breaking down the latest on title 42 &amp; inflation with @seanspicer @LyndsayMKeith!
RepBrianBabin,Had a great meeting with @AWOAdvocacy this week!Ensuring our waterways are dredged and our operators have the tools necessary to get the job done is critical to America’s economic success. 
RepBrianBabin,If you're wondering who will pay to medicate educate and incarcerate the 5-6 million illegals who will cross the border and never leave every year if Title 42 is rescinded the answer is YOU. @EveningEdit 
RepBrianBabin,Gas prices are breaking records daily. Biden could fix it at any time:- End the freeze on new oil/gas - Fast-track pending LNG export permits- Expedite approval of all pipeline/energy development- Cut red tape for U.S. energy 
RepBrianBabin,"The American people said ""NO"" to Biden's unconstitutional Orwellian-style Ministry of Truth.But pausing isn't enough - this ""disinformation board"" should be fully dismantled immediately."
RepBrianBabin,Proud to work with my colleagues to ensure the Water Resources and Development Act of 2022 meets the  needs of our country.Congress must make sure our ports are updated communities protected and federal projects completed. A robust infrastructure = a strong America. 
RepBrianBabin,A few things: 1. Congress must hold #BigTech accountable for censoring free speech.2. Liberal outlets politicizing the tragedy in Buffalo should be ashamed of themselves.3. America needs Title 42.Discussed all three topics on @newsmax - watch below ⤵️ 
RepBrianBabin,Privileged to sit down with Representative @bikhim today to discuss the importance of a robust U.S.-Taiwan alliance and the steps Congress should take to keep it that way!
