SenatorHagerty,The horrible news out of Uvalde Texas is gut-wrenching. 14 innocent and precious lives lost—it’s unspeakable. We pray for this school. We pray for the families. We pray for this community. And we pray for our Nation. 
SenatorHagerty,Last week I joined @SenatorTimScott &amp; @LindseyGrahamSC in urging SCOTUS to uphold states’ ability to exclude abortion clinics from receiving taxpayer Medicaid dollars. States should be free to prevent their taxpayer dollars from subsidizing abortion.
SenatorHagerty,Releasing into the U.S. a suspected terrorist who illegally crossed the border is the kind of dangerous mistake the American people cannot afford. Congress should take immediate action to prevent the Biden Admin from further sabotaging our national security. 
SenatorHagerty,Americans are concerned and frustrated because of Biden’s irresponsible economic policies. He has to change course.
SenatorHagerty,Joining @TeamCavuto shortly to discuss our increasingly emboldened foreign adversaries as a result of Biden’s weak leadership and more. Tune in to @FoxBusiness! 
SenatorHagerty,Biden won't go to the border and address the national security and humanitarian crisis unfolding there—and it's crushing America. 
SenatorHagerty,Recent aggressive actions by MX President AMLO &amp; officials threaten cultural economic &amp; diplomatic ties fundamental to North American prosperity. My colleagues &amp; I are calling on Biden to take immediate action to prevent further damage to the relationship between the U.S. &amp; MX. 
SenatorHagerty,China ‘laughs all the way to the bank’ with Biden policies: Sen. Hagerty | @FoxBusiness 
SenatorHagerty,Republicans are for a Strong America: bring our energy security back bring inflation down bring our borders back intact make our nation stronger and by doing that we'll make our allies stronger. 
SenatorHagerty,I believe there's strong bipartisan consensus in Congress when it comes to the Indo-Pacific &amp; the rising opportunities we see before us to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance &amp; the Quad. I urge Biden to seize these opportunities &amp; stand ready to work with him if he does.
SenatorHagerty,This could be prevented if the Biden Administration secured our southern border. 
SenatorHagerty,Biden's weakness including his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan emboldened Putin to invade Ukraine. We need U.S. &amp; Allied strength to deter Communist China's growing threat to Taiwan &amp; the Indo-Pacific. Talk is cheap military capabilities are not. 
SenatorHagerty,When I visited the border &amp; spoke with Border Patrol Agents they told me that Administration policy is what’s fueling this crisis: If American immigration policy is weak &amp; migrants know they won’t be turned away—even if they come illegally—then that encourages them to come.
SenatorHagerty,The Biden Administration is completely out of touch with Americans. 
SenatorHagerty,The Title 42 ruling is a stay of execution but we still have a massive crisis at the southern border—and the Biden Administration will not acknowledge it.I discussed this and more with @aishahhasnie on @FoxNews. Watch: 
SenatorHagerty,Gives a whole new meaning to the phrase—pain at the pump!When will Joe Biden wake up and recognize that these prices are a direct result of his anti-American energy policies? 
SenatorHagerty,The Biden Administration is talking about taking away China tariffs as if that's going to have some sort of impact on inflation right here in America. The biggest impact that Biden could have on American inflation is to stop his war on American energy. 
SenatorHagerty,Thankfully despite the Biden Admin’s best efforts a judge has ensured Title 42 will remain in place—but Congress should take more action &amp; pass my bill to expand Title 42 to end the record illegal drug trafficking at the border that killed more than 100k Americans last year.
SenatorHagerty,"In GA early voting is up 217% from last midterms. When I pressed him this week Damon Hewitt refused to abandon his stance that the new law “was designed to clamp down on a particular means of voting""—despite current primary data showing the laws are having the OPPOSITE effect. "
SenatorHagerty,Lifting tariffs on China is another misguided policy from the Biden Administration. It’s been a gift from day one to the Chinese Communist Party from Joe Biden.
SenatorHagerty,We urge President Biden to advance U.S. interests while in Tokyo for bilateral meetings with the Kishida government and multilateral meetings with our Quad partners of Japan India and Australia.My joint op-ed with @JohnCornyn &amp; @SenatorCardin: 
SenatorHagerty,"""For I am convinced that neither death nor life neither angels nor demons neither the present nor the future nor any powers neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus.""Romans 8:38-39"
SenatorHagerty,"US-South Korea Alliance remains critical to the security prosperity and freedom of the Indo-Pacific. Biden should continue Trump Admin's maximum pressure campaign against North Korea — not revert back to Obama-era policy of ""Strategic Patience.” "
SenatorHagerty,Senator Bill Hagerty on the Biden Administration’s ‘Theology and Religion of Climate’ Collapsing the Southern Border to ‘Transform’ America | @TheTNStar  
SenatorHagerty,Pleased to commemorate National Police Week to honor &amp; support the law enforcement officers who bravely protect our communities each day—especially the 576 killed in the line of duty in 2021 whose sacrifice receives our eternal immeasurable gratitude.
SenatorHagerty,After three years of Russia Russia Russia from the establishment media now we see hardly any coverage on what appears to be a massive crime syndicate underway within the Biden family. 
SenatorHagerty,The American people deserve to feel safe and secure in their communities. My colleagues and I are calling on the Biden Administration to take action to secure our border &amp; work with us to combat the rising crime wave across the country. 
SenatorHagerty,Biden lifting China tariffs another 'gimmick' Sen. Bill Hagerty says | @FoxBusiness 
SenatorHagerty,Once again the American people have a federal judge to thank for preventing the Biden Admin from making a self-inflicted crisis even worse.My full statement on a judge blocking the Biden Administration from lifting Title 42 authority: 
SenatorHagerty,The Senate unanimously passed my bill w/ @SenAngusKing to reduce time to build plants for semiconductors &amp; other strategic techs by cutting thru red tape. We’ll have these plants built sooner on U.S. soil when the House sends our bill to POTUS to sign into law. 
SenatorHagerty,Sen. Bill Hagerty: Every Step This Administration Has Taken Has Been Toward More Inflation | @RealClearNews  
SenatorHagerty,It was evident on our recent congressional trip to Japan—there are growing opportunities for President Biden to demonstrate American strength advance U.S. interests &amp; counter the CCP in the Indo-Pacific on his trip to Asia.He should seize them. 
SenatorHagerty,Including Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework would be an invaluable signal of our rock-solid commitment to Taiwan &amp; its prosperity &amp; freedom. I've joined @SenatorRisch &amp; @SenatorMenendez in a letter urging the Admin’s inclusion of Taiwan as a partner in the IPEF. 
SenatorHagerty,The world is a more dangerous place thanks to Joe Biden. And what does he do? Blame Americans. 
SenatorHagerty,With its eye on Taiwan China is surely learning lessons from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The United States must urgently work with our ally Japan to boost deterrence and defense. 
SenatorHagerty,When I pressed so-called election experts who have claimed that the 2021 changes to GA’s election laws restrict voter access (proven inaccurate) they were unable to defend the claims. Their doublespeak is shocking but the motivation is clear: it's to inflame. &amp; it’s shameful. 
SenatorHagerty,Unleash American energy.
SenatorHagerty,Hagerty: Biden White House Waging ‘War on America’ | @BreitbartNews 
SenatorHagerty,Despite the Biden Admin’s claim it's trying to reduce gas prices @EPA is pursuing policy that increases prices by denying small refinery exemptions from the renewable fuel standard. I confronted @EPAMichaelRegan about moving toward this policy in spite of record-high gas prices. 
SenatorHagerty,There are critical opportunities for President Biden to advance U.S. interests in Japan. Our nations must urgently act to strengthen defense and deterrence because China with its eye on Taiwan is surely learning lessons from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
SenatorHagerty,While leading a congressional delegation to Japan in April I saw growing opportunities in the Indo-Pacific to advance U.S. interests strengthen the US-Japan alliance &amp; counter Communist China.I urge President Biden to seize these opportunities during his first visit to Asia. 
SenatorHagerty,For too long Americans’ retirement funds have been weaponized by investment advisers to advance political agendas antithetical to many investors’ views &amp; financial interests. Pleased to co-sponsor this bill that is a big step forward in returning voting rights to investors. 
SenatorHagerty,I spoke with @MariaBartiromo on @MorningsMaria about significant consequences that would ensue if the Biden Admin were to lift tariffs on China the latest on reports surrounding the Biden family’s corruption &amp; the historic inflation created by the Biden Admin’s policies. WATCH: 
SenatorHagerty,1 reason for terminating this “Disinfo Governance Board” is that as I noted in a letter to GAO it potentially violates the law against spending taxpayer funds on unapproved items. It’s also a wildly inappropriate &amp; likely unconstitutional use of gov’t power against free speech. 
SenatorHagerty,Going to be a great discussion. Join us at 10:30am ET⤵️ 
SenatorHagerty,We have pressing problems here in America that we're not addressing—we have people in Memphis that can't find formula for their children; people in Knoxville that can't gas their tank up because it's too expensive. We have real problems &amp; they precipitate from the Biden Admin.
SenatorHagerty,96908 of the 234088 migrants encountered at the Southern border last month were expelled because of Title 42. We cannot afford to lose that authority. 
SenatorHagerty,Excited to welcome these interns to our office here in Washington for the summer. They’re embarking on an incredibly growing experience and I’m pleased to be able to be a part of that! 
SenatorHagerty,Every step this Administration has taken has been toward more inflation yet they refuse to take responsibility. 
SenatorHagerty,Biden slammed for 'waging war' on US industry: 'We have crises erupting across our nation' Sen. Hagerty says | @FoxNews 
SenatorHagerty,Our bipartisan delegation sees opportunities for Biden to advance U.S. interests when he travels to Tokyo for bilateral meetings with the Kishida government &amp; multilateral meetings with our Quad partners &amp; we stand ready to work with him to seize them.
SenatorHagerty,Join us! 
SenatorHagerty,Even though the border crisis is worse than ever the Biden Administration is voluntarily ending Title 42 pandemic-related authority. This surrender of American security would be intolerable. 
SenatorHagerty,Good morning! Getting ready to speak to @MariaBartiromo on @FoxBusiness about the Hunter Biden investigation inflation our collapsed southern border and more crises erupting across the nation. Tune in! 📺 
SenatorHagerty,Biden slammed for 'waging war' on US industry: 'We have crises erupting across our nation' Sen. Hagerty says | @FoxNews 
SenatorHagerty,Although Washington may not agree on much right now @JohnCornyn @SenatorCardin &amp; I strongly agree on the growing opportunities for strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance &amp; the Quad. We stand ready to work with Biden in seizing these opportunities.
