EleanorNorton,Doing right by these servicemembers and veterans is one more reason for #DCStatehood. Release: 
EleanorNorton,Ahead of Memorial Day our country owes a special debt of gratitude to DC servicemembers and veterans who serve or have served their country without voting representation in Congress or full local self-government.
EleanorNorton,Today I introduced a bill to designate the post office at 400 Southern Avenue SE Southeast in DC as the “District of Columbia Servicemembers and Veterans Post Office.”
EleanorNorton,Four bills have been introduced this Congress to move federal agency headquarters out of the National Capital Region. These bills are nothing more than cheap talking points attacking federal employees and their work. I will defeat these bills. Details: 
EleanorNorton,Release: 
EleanorNorton,I wrote the Postal Service about an increase in the theft of universal keys allowing thieves to break into blue mail collection boxes steal checks and change the payees and dollar amounts. I requested a response detailing the steps USPS is taking to remedy the problem by 5/30.
EleanorNorton,Release: 
EleanorNorton,@RepMTG has joined @Rep_Clyde in calling for repeal of the DC Home Rule Act abolishing the DC government so the federal government can run DC as a colony again. I will defeat their efforts which only strengthen our case for #DCStatehood. #HandsOffDC
EleanorNorton,DC’s lack of a secondary drinking water source or drinking water reserves makes my provision authorizing the Army Corps to study this matter very critical for DC. Glad to see @TransportDems pass the provision this week as part of the Water Resources Development Act. 
EleanorNorton,I’m pleased to celebrate #BiketoWorkDay today.As the chair of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit I will soon be holding a hearing on road safety.We need to improve the safety of our roads for all users. Lives depend on it.
EleanorNorton,#ClassroomCensorship laws that prohibit free speech in schools are not only wrong—they may also violate First Amendment rights. This is unacceptable and could have disastrous consequences for DC. Watch the @OversightDems hearing:  
EleanorNorton,.@TransportDems today passed my provisions authorizing the Army Corps to study a secondary drinking water source for DC swimming in the Potomac &amp; Anacostia rivers and flooding in the Federal Triangle.Release:  
EleanorNorton,Tomorrow during @OversightDems hearing on classroom censorship I will warn that a Republican House could abuse Congress’ undemocratic power over DC to try to ban books and regulate curriculum in DC public schools. Release: #DCStatehood #HandsOffDC 
EleanorNorton,Over the past 57 years Head Start has grown from an eight-week summer session to a comprehensive program in all states and territories and DC.Join us today in celebrating Head Start's 57th birthday! #HappyBDayHeadStart
