RepLarryBucshon,Today I mourn with those who are grieving the unthinkable loss of students and a teacher at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde Texas. This is a senseless act of violence and it is my hope that we will determine why this individual committed such a horrific crime.
RepLarryBucshon,Today in Evansville I had lunch with the First Federal Savings Bank President Mike Head and we talked about the health of the Main Street economy in Southwest Indiana. While at lunch I also ran into Evansville Mayor Lloyd Winnecke. 
RepLarryBucshon,This week I met with local high school students to discuss the role of Congress in our Constitutional Republic. Thanks to everyone who stopped by! 
RepLarryBucshon,Today marks the 10 year anniversary of the New Harmony Way Bridge closure. I remain committed to getting this local landmark back in working order and serving the Hoosiers of Southwest Indiana. 
RepLarryBucshon,The Biden Administration reversed critical energy policies that increased our dependence on foreign oil and led to dramatic price increases at the pump. #ICYMI: I spoke on the house floor to discuss why we must unleash American energy. More via @93wibc ⬇️ 
RepLarryBucshon,What is the knee jerk solution Washington D.C. Democrats always propose to problems? “Let’s give D.C. bureaucrats more taxpayer money”. The Biden FDA doesn’t need more money to fix the baby formula shortage. They need to do their jobs. I voted NO on H.R. 7790 for that reason.
RepLarryBucshon,This morning I called on my colleagues to unleash American-made energy to reduce the pain all Hoosiers are feeling at the pump. Watch my floor speech here ⬇️ 
RepLarryBucshon,President Biden is doing the unthinkable by easing energy restrictions on Venezuela to compensate for America’s energy needs instead of looking toward America’s own energy sector. Full statement here ⬇️ 
RepLarryBucshon,Efforts to support women with maternal mental health issues lack coordinated action from the federal government and as a result 50% of new moms never receive treatment. In @HouseCommerce we discussed my TRIUMPH for New Moms Act to support maternal health in America. 
RepLarryBucshon,It is critical that we find a path forward in the House to pass the VALID act. By modernizing the way @US_FDA reviews and approves diagnostic tests we can ensure that Americans have access to safe and accurate tests that promotes public safety and spurs innovation.
