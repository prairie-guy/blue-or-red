RepRoKhanna,The recent incident of bullying at Coppell Middle School North targeting a young Indian American student is unacceptable and has touched a nerve across the nation.@RepBera @CongressmanRaja @RepJayapal and I wrote a letter to the school's leaders to voice our deep concerns. 
RepRoKhanna,It looks like I've been sanctioned and banned by Russia for calling out Putin's atrocities and illegal invasion of Ukraine. That makes me more determined to speak out for human rights and Ukraine’s right to sovereignty.
RepRoKhanna,The US is the only wealthy nation in the world without universal health care. It’s time we pass Medicare for All to guarantee health care as a right not a privilege.
RepRoKhanna,Today we remember Harvey Milk one of the first openly gay elected officials in the United States and honor his legacy of fighting for a world where LGBTQ+ people can live their lives openly as themselves.

RepRoKhanna,The Build Back Better bill would have been fully paid for &amp; had productive investments. When you have something fully paid for @LHSummers &amp; other economists will tell you that it doesn’t cause inflation because the Fed isn’t increasing money supply by purchasing treasury bonds. 
RepRoKhanna,Let's make the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.

RepRoKhanna,"192 Republicans voted last night AGAINST emergency funding to address the baby formula shortage. As Dr. Maya Angelou said ""When people show you who they are believe them.”"
RepRoKhanna,Great news. This is a critical step that will help families get the formula they urgently need. 
RepRoKhanna,A huge win that will finally guarantee equal pay for equal work. Thanks to @mPinoe all the women soccer players and advocates who have been fighting for this. 
RepRoKhanna,50% of infant formula in the US is purchased by low-income families who rely on WIC benefits. We need to pass The Access to Baby Formula Act to expand formula options for families who rely on these benefits to make sure they aren't left behind.
RepRoKhanna,Losing a job shouldn't mean losing health care coverage. We need Medicare for All.
RepRoKhanna,Parents shouldn’t be scrambling to find the formula they need to feed their kids. I joined @RepMGS and my colleagues in calling on @POTUS to use every tool available to address the supply chain issues and monopolies driving the formula shortage.
