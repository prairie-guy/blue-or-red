RepScottPeters,Harvey Milk one of the first openly gay elected officials in the U.S. was born 92 years ago today. We honor his legacy of fighting for a world where LGBTQ+ people can live their lives openly as themselves. #HarveyMilkDay 
RepScottPeters,A year ago I joined @repsarajacobs and local AAPI leaders to call on the Department of Defense to honor Medal of Honor recipient Telesforo Trinidad’s legacy by naming a Navy ship after him. Thank you @SECNAV for hearing our call. 
RepScottPeters,Parents across the country are worried about finding enough infant formula to feed their babies. I thank @POTUS for his leadership during this desperate time for many parents &amp; for his latest actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula available for families in need. 
RepScottPeters,In a letter to Minority Leader McConnell in March we urged him to allow a vote on these commonsense reforms that can curb the rise of gun violence in our communities. Nothing should stand in the way of protecting the lives of the people we represent. 
RepScottPeters,Every day that passes without Congressional action for gun safety is a disservice to those who are grieving and all Americans who have a right to live a safe future.
RepScottPeters,Earlier this week I expressed my sadness and frustration after the tragic mass shootings around the country. Americans are waiting for the Senate to vote on two background checks bills HR 8 and HR 1446 which passed the House in March 2021.
RepScottPeters,This bill follows Monday's consent decree that requires Abbott to swiftly restart production of infant formula. The company must ensure its formula is safe. I applaud the FDA for its actions that force Abbott to clean up its act or face up to $30000 per day in penalties.
RepScottPeters,Congress will not take a back seat while millions of families are threatened by the infant formula shortage. I'll vote to pass legislation that gives USDA the power to make it easier for vulnerable families in the WIC program to buy any available infant formula w/their benefits.
RepScottPeters,It's time to take action. Thank you to everyone who has joined our coalition calling for a swift decision. Our climate clean energy and economic goals depend on it.
RepScottPeters,Weeks before this investigation started I urged the Commerce Department in an internal letter to consider the climate &amp; economic impacts of this action. In April I voiced my concerns during an @EnergyCommerce hearing with @SecGranholm.
RepScottPeters,Our group of 85 House members join 22 Senators 19 Governors and many members of the solar environmental and labor communities to call on @POTUS &amp; @SecRaimondo to expedite this investigation. We call climate change a crisis. We need to act like it. 
RepScottPeters,Last night @CongressmanRaja &amp; I co-led a letter to @POTUS requesting the Department of Commerce take steps to expeditiously reach a preliminary decision on its solar inquiry. The investigation is causing solar projects to get canceled &amp; coal plants to stay open. 
RepScottPeters,...ensure our government provides outreach education and specialized assistance to facilitate program participation including those in underserved communities.
RepScottPeters,San Diego’s nonprofits are role models for the rest of the country with their invaluable work to support individuals &amp; groups in need. I voted for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program Improvement Act to...
