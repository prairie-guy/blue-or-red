RepJimBanks,As a girl dad I‚Äôm thankful the Indiana legislature is meeting today to override Governor Holcomb‚Äôs veto of H.B. 1041. Republicans must fight to save girls‚Äô sports! 
RepJimBanks,‚è∞‚è∞ 
RepJimBanks,65% of Hoosiers support legislation to save girls‚Äô sports while just 27% oppose it. Today the statehouse will side with Indiana voters and override the Governor‚Äôs veto!  Read my and @Schilling1776‚Äôs op-ed in @WOWOFORTWAYNE üëá
RepJimBanks,An ISIS terrorist was planning to smuggle assassins across our wide-open southern border to murder former President Bush.The crisis at our southern border is a threat to the sovereignty of our nation and the safety of every community.
RepJimBanks,Instead of supporting the brave Iranian protestors Joe Biden is trying to cut a deal with the terrorist regime. Shameful!
RepJimBanks,Flip-flopping is the worst possible thing Biden could‚Äôve done. The White House must unequivocally stand with Taiwan!
RepJimBanks,Thanks to a TRUMP APPOINTED JUDGE... 
RepJimBanks,The lockdowns and mandates we saw from COVID must NEVER happen again! @RepublicanStudy 
RepJimBanks,The FDA created a baby formula shortage and Dems responded by rewarding the same bureaucrats with millions in taxpayer dollars. Insanity!  
RepJimBanks,If Republicans want to win we must be willing to fight and win this culture war.  I discuss with @JustTheNews üëá 
RepJimBanks,Democrats care more about the Left‚Äôs radical gender theory than protecting the rights of women. Republicans are fighting back. 
RepJimBanks,RELEASE THE TAPES! 
RepJimBanks,Democrats have abandoned the rights and achievements of women for the radical Left's woke agenda. As the father of three daughters I was proud to support @RepDLesko's Women's Bill of Rights resolution reaffirming the unique federal legal protections for women. 
RepJimBanks,This brutal and barbaric practice must come to an end. My legislation would restore a small piece of dignity to the victims of abortion. 
RepJimBanks,I was proud to host my friend and fellow Hoosier @SenatorBraun at @RepublicanStudy lunch today.Senator Braun is a strong conservative voice for Indiana in the Senate and understands the grave importance of tackling our national debt. 
RepJimBanks,The SBA deemed Planned Parenthood affiliates ineligible for Paycheck Protection Program funds but still received over $65 million. Taxpayers should never be forced to pay for abortion. Thank you to my colleague @RepTenney for leading this effort. 
RepJimBanks,This would be a great Saturday Night Live skit if: 1) SNL was still funny2) It wasn‚Äôt a real example of how detached Democrats are from reality 
RepJimBanks,Good news! 
RepJimBanks,Yep Biden's Border crisis is 100% INTENTIONAL!
RepJimBanks,Sending retiree's savings to #CCP companies complicit in genocide is shameful. Biden must follow President Trump‚Äôs example and say no to this insanity! 
RepJimBanks,Biden must learn from his failure to deter Putin's invasion.¬†The US must stand up to Xi and stand with our ally #Taiwan
RepJimBanks,Israel the only Jewish state in the world is America‚Äôs closest ally.Will @SpeakerPelosi condemn this disgusting anti-Semitism or is Democrat leadership now totally in lockstep with The Squad?Shameful and dangerous!
