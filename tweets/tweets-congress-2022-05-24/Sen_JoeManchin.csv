Sen_JoeManchin,GOOD NEWS: I secured more than $5.4M from @HHSGov @HRSAgov to support nine #WV healthcare providers. Our healthcare professionals continue to go above &amp; beyond to care for their fellow West Virginians. I'll continue to advocate for funding to support them. 
Sen_JoeManchin,I invite all West Virginia Veterans to join me tomorrow May 25 at 11AM for a tele-town hall for Veterans to voice their concerns over proposed changes to VA services in West Virginia. Pre-register here:  
Sen_JoeManchin,The VA’s recommendations to the AIR Commission are skewed against rural states like West Virginia. That's just wrong. I will always stand up for West Virginia Veterans. 
Sen_JoeManchin,Today I led bipartisan colleagues in reintroducing the Elimination of the VA Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission Act which would eliminate the commission that is tasked with finding VA facilities that should be consolidated or realigned. MORE: 
Sen_JoeManchin,WATCH: The Administration's recent actions are alarmingly chilling investment in the oil &amp; gas sector. Its short-sighted approach to production puts America’s energy security at risk. But the Administration can fix this — and it doesn't need legislation or new authority to do so. 
Sen_JoeManchin,#ICYMI: I hosted @NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy in Marion County where we visited the @WVSSAC Robotics Championship &amp; @NASAIVV. W/ further investments in #STEM I'm confident #WV students will continue to make an impact on nation's space program ✨ 
Sen_JoeManchin,To all of those who have served or are currently serving in our Armed Forces - thank you for your courageous service sacrifice &amp; patriotism for our nation. #ArmedForcesDay 
Sen_JoeManchin,REMINDER: I'm inviting all #WV Veterans to join me for a tele-town hall Wednesday May 25 at 11AM. I want to hear your questions &amp; concerns about the @DeptVetAffairs AIR Commission's harmful recommendations for our VA healthcare system. Pre-register here:  
Sen_JoeManchin,Given the current global situation - Putin’s horrific invasion of Ukraine &amp; weaponization of oil &amp; gas increasing energy &amp; food prices worldwide &amp; the growing challenge of competition with China- it's essential for America to step up to the plate as the superpower of the world. 
Sen_JoeManchin,I will continue fighting for bipartisan ways to support the remaining 756 West Virginia restaurants and bars that previously applied to the Restaurant Revitalization Fund but were denied. MORE: 
Sen_JoeManchin,When the first round of funding went out through the #AmericanRescuePlan 1033 West Virginia restaurants applied for over $140 million in relief but only 277 received funding.
Sen_JoeManchin,Today I was proud to vote for the Small Business COVID Relief Act of 2022 which would help rebuild Main Streets across West Virginia. 
Sen_JoeManchin,I’ve called on the @US_FDA to fully address this dire issue and to implement reforms so this never happens again. Read my recent letter to FDA Commissioner @DrCaliff_FDA on the FDA’s failure to address the nationwide infant formula shortage: 
Sen_JoeManchin,As families in #WV &amp; beyond struggle w/ infant formula shortages @DrCaliff_FDA put unqualified @DrWoodcockFDA in charge of @US_FDA's delayed response. Dr. Woodcock shouldn’t be in charge of FDA’s response to this critical situation — or ANY office at FDA. 
Sen_JoeManchin,Putin’s war in Ukraine must serve as a permanent wake up call to the international community that we cannot rely upon hostile nations for the free world's energy security. The only way we'll be able to guarantee it is to rely on ourselves and our proven partners around the globe. 
Sen_JoeManchin,The Administration is talking to OPEC Iran &amp; Venezuela about increasing oil output while at the same time blocking increased energy production at home. What does this say to producers here in America? Is this really in our best interest? 
Sen_JoeManchin,The Administration likes to say that there are 9000 permits sitting unused &amp; that’s why we don’t need to do any more onshore or offshore leasing. But if their argument is that industry is to blame for sitting on these leases &amp; permits then why don’t they do something about it? 
Sen_JoeManchin,Even as Russia wages a war enabled by energy insecurity across Europe this Administration has made its opposition to domestic oil &amp; gas production crystal clear. Instead we must act immediately to restart the responsible development of our abundant energy &amp; mineral resources. 
Sen_JoeManchin,WATCH: We can't continue to be a global superpower if we have to depend on unfriendly &amp; hostile nations to produce our energy. That's why I’m convening a hearing today at 10AM in my @EnergyDems Committee to discuss the President's proposed @Interior budget &amp; policy priorities. 
Sen_JoeManchin,GOOD NEWS: My bill to give @VetAffairsOIG the power to subpoena has passed the House &amp; is headed to the President's desk! This bipartisan bill will improve transparency &amp; accountability at the VA making VA hospitals safer for our Veterans. @Militarydotcom 
Sen_JoeManchin,Today I'm proud to celebrate #57YearsOfHeadStart! Head Start provides children with the skills and foundations they need for a bright future. Please join me in thanking #WV Head Start teachers &amp; staff for all that they do for our kids! @NatlHeadStart @HeadStartGov 
Sen_JoeManchin,Today's announcement is a historic step toward achieving equality for women. From the soccer pitch to the office women deserve #EqualPay and that's why I introduced legislation that would bridge the pay disparity in @ussoccer. 
Sen_JoeManchin,The @DeptVetAffairs AIR Commission's recommendations would significantly impact Veterans' access to health care. That's why I'm inviting all #WV Veterans to join me for a tele-town hall Wednesday May 25 at 11AM. Pre-register here:  
Sen_JoeManchin,As Putin weaponizes energy against our friends and allies in Europe and China looks to corner the critical minerals market the United States must step up to the plate and contribute our part to the free world's energy supply and security. 
Sen_JoeManchin,Today I welcomed leaders from Canada to my @EnergyDems Committee to discuss the importance of creating a powerful North American Energy Alliance that can strengthen our collective energy security while combatting climate change and promoting global peace and stability.
