RepSlotkin,I know I speak for Oxford &amp; all Michiganders when I say that our hearts are with the students teachers families &amp; first responders whose lives were upended today. If we can be of service — just as the communities of Parkland &amp; Sandy Hook were a help to us — please call us. 4/4
RepSlotkin,My staff and I learned from the terrible fraternity of Members of Congress who have had a school shooting in their district and sadly my team is now in a position to help. 3/4
RepSlotkin,My heart goes out to the people of Uvalde. The only way to survive is to hold each other close and hold on for dear life. My team and I have reached out to Rep. Gonzales’s office to offer any support they may need. 2/4
RepSlotkin,Devastating news out of Texas. In November all Michiganders saw firsthand the devastation a school shooting brings and as the representative for Oxford the pain is still raw from those first moments of shock disbelief and then what feels like a truck parked on your chest. 1/4 
RepSlotkin,I’ve gone from being banned temporarily to banned for life. If that’s the price to pay for standing up for democracy I’ll take it — and no one pays in Rubles anyways. 
RepSlotkin,The tornado that ripped through Gaylord yesterday is a stark reminder of how sudden &amp; severe these cells can be. My thoughts are with the people of Gaylord as they begin to rebuild &amp; with the first responders who have been working around the clock to keep the community safe. 
RepSlotkin,Unfortunately 192 members didn’t support this bill which is just head-shaking to me. Based on the calls coming in from parents &amp; nurses this should be a no-brainer. We need to use every tool and pull every lever we can to get formula back on the shelves ASAP. 3/3
RepSlotkin,The stories I’ve heard from moms driving hours to pharmacies bartering in Facebook groups and rationing formula are heartbreaking. Yesterday a bipartisan group of Members of Congress voted to approve new resources for the FDA to help alleviate the shortage. 2/3
RepSlotkin,This week I joined a bipartisan group urging the President to invoke the Defense Production Act to ensure that U.S. manufacturers preference items needed for baby formula ahead of other orders they have. Good to see the administration moving on this. 1/3
RepSlotkin,I am so proud of each and every one of them. My sincere congratulations to the graduates their parents families and the entire Oxford Community.
RepSlotkin,The Oxford High School Class of 2022 is special in so many ways. They’ve had to overcome so many challenges &amp; lessons not taught in a classroom. From navigating the pandemic to a community tragedy I’ve seen firsthand how they’ve balanced loss and grief with grace and gratitude. 
RepSlotkin,No one questions whether these companies can make money or make up money they lost during the pandemic. But this bill is a shot across the bow to the biggest oil conglomerates — they shouldn’t take advantage of Americans &amp; ignore the financial pain of their fellow countrymen.
RepSlotkin,There’s no silver bullet to lower the price or gas or else we would have fired it. But it’s our job to  use every tool in our toolbox to bring folks some relief.
RepSlotkin,Michiganders many of whom drive 40 miles one way to work are paying record prices to fill up their cars all while the biggest oil companies rake in record profits. Today I voted yes on a bill to stop price gouging at the pump.
RepSlotkin,Here in Congress we’re the ones who write the laws and that means we’re responsible for rising above partisan politics to find bipartisan solutions. I’m urging the Democratic leadership to take up this legislation so we can get to the root of the problem &amp; pass real reform. 4/4
RepSlotkin,And because these surges are exacerbated by human smugglers the Border Security and Migrant Safety Act requires our cooperation with neighboring countries to crack down on transnational criminal groups taking advantage of the current situation. 3/4
RepSlotkin,We need to treat the crisis at the southern border like we do natural disasters – with a swift whole-of-government approach. The Emergency Migration Response Act increases cooperation between federal agencies so we can speed resources medical care &amp; personnel to the border. 2/4
RepSlotkin,Our immigration system has been broken through multiple administrations – Democrat &amp; Republican. That’s why I’m teaming up with @RepTonyGonzales to introduce 2 bills that overhaul our response to migration surges &amp; crack down on illegal human trafficking. 
RepSlotkin,I’ve met far too many Michigan veterans who have been forced to jump through legal hoops just to get the care they deserve. This is landmark legislation that cuts through red tape so our vets don’t have to fight the VA while also battling the effects of toxic exposure.
RepSlotkin,Some HUGE news for our veterans — my Veterans Burn Pits Exposure Recognition Act was included when this bill passed the House earlier this year and I’ll be working to ensure it makes its way into the final product.
RepSlotkin,For years we looked the other way on Russian aggression in the hopes that it would go away. We can’t make the same mistake in another important part of Europe. 4/4
RepSlotkin,Case in point is the Balkans: Given the painful history we must be clear in our response to actions that threaten peace or contribute to the tensions between Kosovars and Serbs. 3/4
RepSlotkin,The U.S. &amp; Kosovo have a special relationship born from shared history &amp; close cooperation. Today we built on that with discussions on energy economic cooperation &amp; the different way we need to look at security in Europe now that Russia has so egregiously invaded Ukraine. 2/4
RepSlotkin,This afternoon I had the pleasure of sitting down with Prime Minister of the Republic of Kosovo @albinkurti. He came by way of Michigan where he spent time with members of our state’s thriving diaspora. 1/4
