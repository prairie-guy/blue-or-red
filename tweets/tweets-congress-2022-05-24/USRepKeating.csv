USRepKeating,Finland and Sweden are already strong economic and security partners and their membership in @NATO will bolster our shared defenses. Congressional support is comprehensive and bipartisan and we urge the swift approval of these applications by all NATO members.
USRepKeating,This week along with @RepBrianFitz @RepSwalwell &amp; @RepAnnWagner I introduced a resolution in strong support of Finland and Swedenâ€™s application to join @NATO. Glad to be joined by Chairs and RM's from @HouseForeign the House Finland/Sweden Caucus and @natopapress. 
USRepKeating,Yesterday I met with @leonidvolkov to discuss @navalny's health and the next steps in supporting democratic movements in Russia. @navalny @vkaramurza and other's resilience and resolve are an inspiration for all of us as they continue the fight for freedom in Russia.
