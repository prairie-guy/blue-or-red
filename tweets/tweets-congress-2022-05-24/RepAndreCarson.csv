RepAndreCarson,I am heartbroken by this horrific act of violence and praying for every victim.A nation that witnesses multiple shootings at elementary schools and doesn't change its gun laws is a nation that has lost its way. We must enact life saving reforms immediately. 
RepAndreCarson,If you are a veteran in the 7th Congressional District and need help securing benefits you've earned please contact my Indianapolis office at 317-283-6516 or visit my website: 
RepAndreCarson,Some good news from Team Carson: My office helped a local Vietnam War veteran in end-of-life care obtain the medals he lost. Now that they're in his possession he is eligible for much greater assistance through @DeptVetAffairs. Thanks to this brave Hoosier for his service! 
RepAndreCarson,Read our letter here: 
RepAndreCarson,That's why I've sent a letter to @SecBlinken and @FBI Director Wray asking them to open up an investigation into her death. Thanks to my colleagues Rep. @BillPascrell and @RepLouCorrea for co-leading this letter and to all cosigners lending their voice to this important effort. 
RepAndreCarson,The killing of Al Jazeera reporter and fellow American #ShireenAbuAkleh was not only a tragedy; it was an affront to press freedom and to all Americans. We need answers and accountability from the Israeli government.
RepAndreCarson,I was disappointed that one of these bills HR 7790 passed with hardly any support from Republicans. In order to overcome this crisis both parties need to put politics aside and work together. I urge my Senate colleagues to pass both of these vital pieces of legislation asap!
RepAndreCarson,Yesterday @HouseDemocrats passed two bills in our chamber that help solve the baby formula shortage. These bills specifically help @US_FDA get more formula on shelves and help families in need continue to use WIC to buy formula in times of crisis.
RepAndreCarson,
RepAndreCarson,Rising prices &amp; supply-chain disruptions have worsened the food insecurity crisis among senior citizens. To combat this problem I'm working to lower costs for seniors &amp; make healthy groceries more accessible. Read more about my plan on page 8 of the @Seniors_League newsletter
