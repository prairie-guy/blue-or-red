GOPLeader,.@OhioAG Dave Yost discusses his strategy to fight for border security and stop the flood of deadly fentanyl flowing into Ohio communities from the southern border. 
GOPLeader,Terror suspects are crossing the southern border illegallyJust today we learned one suspect with ties to ISIS planned to smuggle assassins across the border to target former President Bush 
GOPLeader,.@GOPLeader in Ohio: President Biden’s open border policies have   “made every single city in America a border city.”That means more deaths when it comes to fentanyl. 
GOPLeader,President Biden refuses to acknowledge the harm his open border policies have done in places like Ohio. Even worse—he offers no new federal help to fund more border agents or lock up drug traffickers. Put simply: Biden is failing to keep Americans safe. 
GOPLeader,I'm in Ohio with @RepBalderson and @OhioAG for a roundtable discussion about the deadly fentanyl that is destroying our communities. Much of it is made in China and comes across the Mexican border unchecked by the Biden Admin.Watch here at 3:15pm ET: 
GOPLeader,RT to agree → If someone crosses the border illegally and they are caught by Border Patrol they should go back to their country. That's common sense.
GOPLeader,A federal judge just blocked another disastrous decision but the Biden administration should not see today’s ruling as a political bail out.The American people deserve a secure border.I call on President Biden to fully enforce Title 42.
GOPLeader,Since President Biden took office Democrats have ignored every single crisis facing our nation.Afghanistan. Inflation. Crime. The border. The list goes on and on. 
GOPLeader,From the border crisis to the crime surge to skyrocketing price of gas—Democrats’ radical socialist policies are costing you. America can’t afford another two years of Democrats’ one-party rule—period.
GOPLeader,Ending Title 42 will open our border even more to lethal fentanyl and subjects on the terrorist watch list.Biden's Border Crisis is making our country and our communities less safe.
GOPLeader,The Biden administration has known since last year that a nationwide shortage of baby formula could happen but failed to prevent it. Now Democrats want to push a bill where HALF of the funds won’t be spent until NEXT YEAR. Parents can't afford to wait another year.
GOPLeader,The Biden administration is scrambling five days before their own deadline to end Title 42 because President Biden’s open border policies have created an unsustainable crisis for our country.
GOPLeader,How out of touch could they possibly be?House Democrats admit that no one in their caucus views historically high gas prices as a problem. 
GOPLeader,It's a slap in the face to every family struggling to put food on the table and gas in the tank. → Speaker Pelosi decided to give everyone in Congress a Peloton gym membership. This contract could cost taxpayers an extra $100000 or more per month. 
GOPLeader,This Congress will go down in history as the out-of-touch Congress.This week as families scramble to find baby formula Speaker Pelosi’s House decided to hand out special Peloton memberships paid for by taxpayers.Tune in for my speech starting soon:
GOPLeader,This Congressional Gold Medal for the courageous Merchant Mariners of WWII is long overdue. For 76 years they were denied full recognition as veterans. Today we are correcting that slight.
