CongressmanHice,A federal judge just blocked the Biden Administration from lifting Title 42!They NEVER had a plan in place to address the HISTORIC number of migrants that would flood the southern border.This is a HUGE win for our national security!

CongressmanHice,American mothers canâ€™t find formula for their babies.The solution from the DC Democrats? Throw away $28 million on salaries for federal bureaucrats.

CongressmanHice,Okay now visit the southern border. 
CongressmanHice,It's time for Joe to take responsibility! 
CongressmanHice,The Constitution guarantees all Americans have certain unalienable rights that no one can strip away.Like life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.Abortion denies unborn babies of their God-given constitutional rights.

CongressmanHice,Democrats in their deranged hysteria over Trump weaponized the power of impeachment for purely partisan purposes.The 1st impeachment? A hoax based on outright lies. The 2nd impeachment? A theatrical sham.ðŸ‘‡ I'm proud to join @RepMullin's resolution.
