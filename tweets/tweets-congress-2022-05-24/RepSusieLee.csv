RepSusieLee,Absolutely horrific. I am praying for the children teachers staff and their families.We cannot let this continue to be normal. We have to muster the courage to honor their lives with action to end gun violence. 
RepSusieLee,ICYMI: Last week the House voted to pass my workforce development bill as part of the Workforce Innovation &amp; Opportunity Act! This legislation will bring workers educators and employers together to create training programs to prepare workers for good-paying jobs.
RepSusieLee,Nevada families have seen the worst of the infant formula shortage.That is why I voted YES with @HouseDemocrats to get the FDA the resources it needs to address this shortage &amp; help prevent it from ever happening again. #FeedOurInfants
RepSusieLee,"There are two types of people in Washington.The ones who ask ""why didn't we do something sooner"" when it's too late and the ones who recognize that we must act now.Wildfires. Record Heat Waves. Historic Drought. The signs are clear for Nevadans.We must #ActOnClimate now."
RepSusieLee,Happy Birthday @RepDinaTitus! It‚Äôs such an honor to represent Nevada alongside you. 
RepSusieLee,I don't think we should put the profits of Big Oil corporations over the opportunity to lower your costs at the gas pump.
RepSusieLee,In Nevada we voted to protect choice by a 2-to-1 margin.But Washington Republicans won't just ban abortion state-by-state. They want to ban it everywhere.They're out of touch out of line and out to take control.
RepSusieLee,This Armed Forces Day we celebrate all who serve in uniform with honor.I will always be grateful to service members and their families for the sacrifices they make ‚Äî and I will never stop fighting to support them here in Congress. 
RepSusieLee,This week nearly 200 House Republicans voted against American families.Sadly that's a normal week for them.Paid Family Leave: NOExpanded Child Care: NOCutting Middle Class Taxes: NODemocrats are fighting for American families.
RepSusieLee,The pandemic hit Nevada's economy the hardest.But take a look around. Record small business growth. Private sector employment above pre-pandemic levels. Our recovery is booming.But we're not done yet. Let's keep our recovery moving full-speed ahead.
RepSusieLee,Welp I will unfortunately not be biking to work while I'm working from home and recovering from COVID...But I assure you that almost every day I do in fact bike to Congress! Here's the proof  ‚¨áüö≤ #BikeToWorkDay 
RepSusieLee,Let's make this clear. @HouseDemocrats have a plan to lower gas prices &amp; hold Big Oil corporations accountable. We passed it in the House today.Washington Republicans have no plan and NOT ONE of their members voted for the bill to lower your costs.
RepSusieLee,If Washington Republicans cared about American families they would have voted for‚ùåPaid Family Leave‚ùåThe Expanded Child Tax Credit‚ùå&amp; Expanded Access to Child CareBut they didn't ‚Äì and last night they voted against ending the baby formula shortage.
RepSusieLee,Since Putin launched his assault on the Ukrainian people this Congress &amp; the Biden Administration have moved urgently to bring support to the people of Ukraine. I applaud the Senate's passage of this package that will build on our support for Ukraine. 
RepSusieLee,You can‚Äôt manage what you can‚Äôt measure.Our federal agencies must work together to solve our water crisis and that means we must share water information and data across agencies. Today I‚Äôm proud to introduce the bipartisan Water Data Act with @Rep_Stansbury.
RepSusieLee,The math doesn‚Äôt add up.üõ¢Big Oil made $71 billion in profitsüõ¢9000 untapped public leasesüõ¢Record high gas prices at the pumpThat's why I joined @HouseDemocrats in passing legislation to lower your gas prices &amp; hold Big Oil accountable for #RippingOffAmericans.
RepSusieLee,The Access to Baby Formula Act will provide and support our most vulnerable families by improving WIC participants‚Äô access to safe formula products.And the @AppropsDems Supplemental Funding Legislation will get the FDA the resources it needs to address this shortage right now.
RepSusieLee,Parents are being confronted by empty shelves as they try to find safe and affordable baby formula for their children.That is why tonight I voted to pass two bills to address this shortage &amp; help prevent it from ever happening again. #FeedOurInfants 
RepSusieLee,And he's back again!My bipartisan Virtual Peer Support Act just passed out of @EnergyCommerce (on a 51-1 vote!) and is headed to the House Floor for a final vote in the coming months.It's common-sense legislation that will expand access to mental health resources. 
RepSusieLee,Today is #HeadStart's 57th birthday! Join me in celebrating the nationwide impact of this vital program and the 39+ million #HeadStart alumni who have made such a difference in Nevada and across the country. 
RepSusieLee,The @NatlParkService ensures that our iconic national parks recreation areas historic monuments and so much more are protected and conserved for years to come. Join me for @AppropsDems hearing to oversee their budget requests:  
RepSusieLee,The potential for additional solar tariffs threatens to kill Nevada jobs and the progress we've made toward building a clean energy economy.I led a letter with @CongressmanRaja to urge President Biden &amp; @CommerceGov to move swiftly and take these concerns into account. 
RepSusieLee,Happy 25th Anniversary to @NewDemCoalition!Gridlock partisanship politics as usual. For 25 years New Dems have been fighting those faults to produce good policy and get stuff done. Proud to be a #NewDem. #25YearsofNewDems 
RepSusieLee,Moms do not have time to wait for Washington to feed their babies. I joined @RepSherrill &amp; my fellow moms in the House in calling on this administration to immediately expand production of baby formula and present a plan to prevent future shortages.  
RepSusieLee,This pandemic has ripped off the bandage of our mental health crisis.But it's started a conversation that we need to have to expand access to care for all. I'm looking forward to continuing to work alongside our dedicated mental health professionals to find and enact solutions.
