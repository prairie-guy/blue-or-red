RepDanKildee,Elected officials should not use their position of power to trade stocks that enrich themselves and their families.My bipartisan legislation would ban Members of Congress and their families from trading stocks while in office. Itâ€™s time Congress passes this important bill.
RepDanKildee,Itâ€™s outrageous that Big Pharma can charge Michiganders $1000/month for a lifesaving drug like insulin when it only costs a couple $ to make. The House passed my bill to cap the cost of insulin at $35/month and Iâ€™ll keep fighting to ensure Medicare can negotiate drug prices. 
RepDanKildee,By investing in workforce training &amp; career services we can ensure Michigan workers have the skills they need to secure good-paying jobs that can support a family.I'm proud to help pass legislation that will make Michiganâ€™s economy more competitive today &amp; in the future. 
RepDanKildee,Michigan families see higher gas prices at the pump in part because Big Oil is deliberately keeping production low to keep prices &amp; their profits high.Iâ€™m proud the House passed legislation to address this unfair price gouging &amp; lower costs for MI.
RepDanKildee,Every Michigander deserves access to quality health careâ€”including mental health care. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m working to improve access to mental health care in mid-Michigan every single day of this #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth and every month. 
RepDanKildee,Every time we step in the @FlintLibrary we will think of Edith and her legacy. Edith fought for Black Michigandersâ€™ rights and dedicated her career to her community. What a well deserved honor for an incredible mid-Michigander. 
RepDanKildee,Vladimir Putin just banned me for life from Russia. Iâ€™ll wear it as a badge of honor for my support of democracy and the people of Ukraine. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ 
RepDanKildee,103 years ago today the House passed the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote.Our fight for equality continues today as we work to protect every woman's fundamental right to make their own health care decisions. In Congress I will always defend womenâ€™s rights.
RepDanKildee,Our service members and military families sacrifice so much to keep us safe. This #ArmedForcesDay and every day we are grateful for your service.In Congress I'll continue fighting to ensure you receive the earned benefits you deserve. 
RepDanKildee,My heart goes out to the families of those killed injured and affected by the devastating tornado in Gaylord. Thank you to the first responders working to respond to this severe weather &amp; keep people safe. 
RepDanKildee,Michiganders know the importance of investing in our water infrastructure. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law which I supported will invest in replacing our lead service lines to insure every Michigander has access to clean safe drinking water.
RepDanKildee,Great to meet with students from Tawas Middle School recently in DC! Thereâ€™s no better way to start learning about how our government works than to see it first hand in our nationâ€™s capital. 
RepDanKildee,Great news for Michigan potato farmers!I helped pass USMCA to replace bad trade deals and ensure Michigan farmers can fairly access foreign markets.In Congress I'll keep fighting for our rural communities and farmers.
RepDanKildee,From violence in our schools to racially &amp; religiously motivated violence in places of worship the rise in domestic terrorist attacks across the country must stop.I helped pass legislation to provide resources &amp; tools to combat these threats.
RepDanKildee,I know how stressful it is for parents trying to find formula to feed their children.Thatâ€™s why I voted for emergency legislation in the House to get more safe infant formula onto shelves across Michigan &amp; the country.
RepDanKildee,My bill is named after Bob von Schwedler who worked at Delphi for 36 years before losing his pension and benefits. The Health Coverage Tax Credit was critical in helping Bob beat cancer. My bill will restore and increase this critical program to help more people like Bob. 
RepDanKildee,Every Michigander deserves access to quality affordable health care including Delphi Salaried Retirees and those who lost jobs due to bad trade deals.Thatâ€™s why I just introduced legislation to lower health care costs for these workers and retirees.
RepDanKildee,Congratulations to Little Miss Flint! Since the start of the Flint water crisis when you were only 8 years old you have advocated for our community with determination and grace. Our community is grateful for your voice.
