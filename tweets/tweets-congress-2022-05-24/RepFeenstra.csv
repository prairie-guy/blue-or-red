RepFeenstra,This is the right decision. Ending #Title42 would make the border crisis even worse than it already is. We need to secure the border now. #IA04 
RepFeenstra,Democrats’ anti-American energy policies have caused gas prices to soar to record highs but they’ll stop at nothing to impose their radical Green New Deal agenda on America. @HouseGOP is committed to unleashing American energy &amp; lowering gas prices. #IA04
RepFeenstra,Sat down with @FeedFolks this morning to discuss the importance of an affordable stable supply of animal feed for our farmers &amp; producers in #IA04. As the breadbasket to the world Iowa is the top consumer of animal feed in the nation using 28.8 million tons of feed last year. 
RepFeenstra,I had an informative discussion with @GrowthEnergy about how Iowa ethanol and biodiesel can make America energy independent again. Biofuels can lower gas prices lower emissions and power the future. #IA04 
RepFeenstra,Joined Charlie Stone in D.C. for a great conversation on the border crisis my bill to address the infant formula shortage &amp; inflation. The Biden Admin has created &amp; ignored crisis after crisis. Our families &amp; rural communities can’t afford his liberal progressive agenda. #IA04 
RepFeenstra,Great to sit down with the @SiouxlndChamber this morning to discuss many issues important to #IA04 and the tri-state region. From expanding rural healthcare to addressing workforce and skills training we need to work together to deliver results for our families and main streets.
