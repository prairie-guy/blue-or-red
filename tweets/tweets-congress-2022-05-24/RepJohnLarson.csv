RepJohnLarson,My heart breaks for the students &amp; families in Uvalde. Nearly a decade ago we lost 20 children &amp; 6 adults at Sandy Hook Elementary. What have we done since then to prevent another mass shooting? The House has voted it's time the Senate does its job.
RepJohnLarson,It was a pleasure to visit the @NEAMuseum in Windsor Locks this morning. New England's largest aerospace museum they are home to a broad collection of aircrafts engines and aviation history. 
RepJohnLarson,It is a badge of honor. I’m proud to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and work in Washington to ensure they have what they need to fight this unwarranted attack from Russia. 
RepJohnLarson,Join me for a community conversation Thursday in North Hartford at 11:30 AM with @MayorBronin and @CTDOTOfficial to discuss the local impact of the #BipartisanInfrastructureLaw I helped pass in Congress and how it will transform our region. Register here: 
RepJohnLarson,Funding we secured for East Hartford in the #BipartisanInfrastructureLaw will fast-track the development of hydrogen energy so we can meet @POTUS' goal of pollution-free electricity by 2030. Connecticut is at the forefront of cleaner greener energy! 
RepJohnLarson,Harvey Milk helped stop a law in California banning gay and lesbian people from working in public schools. Decades later I am fighting with my colleagues in Congress to realize his vision where LGBTQ+ youth can grow up in a world free from discrimination. #HarveyMilkDay 
RepJohnLarson,This Armed Forces Day we recognize the servicemembers in uniform who serve our country with honor.Words will never be enough to express our gratitude to servicemembers and their families for the sacrifices they make. I will never stop fighting for them. 
RepJohnLarson,Congratulations to @The_Charter_Oak for opening their new health center in Hartford with @hisphealth_ct! I am proud I secured funding in Congress for Charter Oak to expand services during COVID and better serve their patients. 
RepJohnLarson,Today with my support the House passed critical legislation to stop Big Oil from #RippingOffAmericans and help lower prices at the pump by:✅ Ending price gouging✅ Penalizing market manipulators✅ Bringing transparency to this secretive market
RepJohnLarson,I stood in solidarity with my House colleagues today condemning the racist shooting in Buffalo. Yesterday we passed the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act in response to the hate-driven attacks that have plagued our country. I urge the Senate to take quick action on this bill. 
RepJohnLarson,The families in #CT01 have felt the pain of the infant formula shortage firsthand. That is why I voted for emergency funding to improve access to safe formula now get the FDA the resources it needs to address this shortage and help prevent it from ever happening again!
RepJohnLarson,My @WaysMeansCmte colleagues joined me in urging the Biden Administration to create a Beneficiary Advocate within the Social Security Administration. We must ensure SSA &amp; Congress know what beneficiaries need! 
RepJohnLarson,It was an honor to join with dedicated activists today as we work to repeal WEP/GPO. I'm proud Social Security 2100: A Sacred Trust would fix this problem that reduces Social Security benefits for many public servants including teachers!
