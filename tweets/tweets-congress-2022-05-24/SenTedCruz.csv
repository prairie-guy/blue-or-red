SenTedCruz,.@TheBlock__ : Ted Cruz: 'I want Texas to be the oasis on planet Earth for bitcoin and crypto' 
SenTedCruz,Joe Biden has gotten everything wrong. If you were in Vegas just have Biden pick between red or black and you bet the opposite. If you did you’d leave the casino very wealthy! 
SenTedCruz,Bitcoin and crypto represent freedom.It's not surprising that there is tremendous pushback from most Democrats because they cannot control cryptocurrencies. Thank you to the @Heritage Foundation for hosting this exciting discussion tonight. 
SenTedCruz,Texas will continue leading the way in crypto innovation and development! 
SenTedCruz,There shouldn’t even be a formula shortage to begin with. Joe Biden’s FDA has slow-walked the reopening of one of America’s largest formula production plants. Nonetheless Biden and the media will tout this airlift as a massive victory.

SenTedCruz,President Biden cannot have it both ways: He cannot tell Americans that COVID-19 remains a threat while telling illegal immigrants that it doesn’t. Title 42 is vital for both our national and health security. 1/x
SenTedCruz,Democrats saying that they are going to tax our way out of inflation is backwards. It’s reminiscent of the “more cowbell” SNL skit. 
SenTedCruz,President Biden doesn’t want you to see this chart! 
SenTedCruz,"""Please do not lift Title 42 because what’s going to happen in the border cities is it will be a lot worse than what’s happening right now."" Border town mayors know that ending Title 42 will be a catastrophe. #BidenBorderCrisis. "

SenTedCruz,My team and I are currently monitoring the ongoing wildfires in Taylor County. Please comply with local officials and heed their warnings. Heidi and I are praying for Taylor County and the first responders there! 
SenTedCruz,"44 Democratic Senators voted against my bill to sanction Nord Stream 2 despite calls from the President Prime Minister Parliament and people of Ukraine to pass it. That was the last chance to deter Putin from invading Ukraine.Now they talk about a ""Putin wing"" of the GOP. "
SenTedCruz,If the objective is to stop violent crime it is best to focus on policy that works: targeting actual violent criminals.
