RepValDemings,Another school shooting. I can hardly speak. Every parent in America should be mad as hell that the Senators of the greatest country in the world have chosen not to do a damn thing about innocent people gunned down in innocent places. Praying for the victims at Robb Elementary.
RepValDemings,As a law enforcement officer when something went wrong we asked ourselves: what could we have done different? How could we have saved that one additional life? We need to hold Congress to the same standard fix what’s broken and stand up to violence and extremism. 
RepValDemings,The first Operation Flight Formula flight landed in the US carrying 70000 lbs. of baby formula. Getting parents the resources they need for their infants is our top priority. We passed baby formula funding last week. The Senate must act.
RepValDemings,As a former Chief of Police our community expected us to do something and we did. Partnerships are critical to preventing domestic terrorism and violent extremism like the Buffalo mass shooting. Working together we can make a difference.
RepValDemings,Violent extremism is a threat to every American. Mourning the victims is not enough. Faith without works is dead. We must confront and stop these campaigns of targeted incitement and violence before they rear their ugly head in your city or town.
RepValDemings,“If the Supreme Court confirms its draft decision women will die.” #DefendRoe 
RepValDemings,Investing in American workers is how we keep America great.
RepValDemings,With or without a college degree Americans are back to work in full force. The U.S. economy has seen record breaking job creation. Our top priority now is bringing down costs of healthcare housing gas groceries and more.
RepValDemings,She once said this: “It is easy enough to vote right and be consistently with the majority. But it is more often more important to be ahead of the majority and this means being willing to cut the first furrow in the ground and stand alone for a while if necessary.” 
RepValDemings,After she left Congress she went on to a long career of advocacy for her state and the American people. Then in her later years she ran for Congress again returning to represent her constituents and fighting to expand access to health care as her top priority. 
RepValDemings,Crucially she led the way to pass Title IX which today protects students from sexual discrimination. After her death Title IX was renamed the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act in her honor.
RepValDemings,As the first woman of color in Congress Rep. Mink was pivotal in passing bills to expand childcare and education bills including Head Start. She worked to protect the environment and fix our immigration system. 
RepValDemings,In the 1950s she became involved in politics working with Japanese-American veterans suffering discrimination despite honorable service in WWII. She ran for office and won. Then Hawaii became a state. She ran for Congress. She lost ran again and won. 
RepValDemings,She would go on to fight throughout her life to end racial and gender discrimination saying “We have to build things...to make sure that others do not have to suffer the same discrimination.”
RepValDemings,Patsy dreamed of being a doctor. She attended a segregated college. Ten medical schools turned her down. She attended law school instead. She passed the bar. No firm would hire her. So she opened her own becoming the first Japanese-American woman to practice law in Hawaii.
RepValDemings,Patsy Takemoto Mink was the first woman of color elected to the U.S. Congress and a lifelong champion of civil rights and human dignity. Here’s her story as we celebrate #AAPIHeritageMonth 
RepValDemings,With graduation season upon us I want to congratulate the class of 2022 for your hard work and success during challenging times. I hope you are inspired to follow your dreams. Many blessings to you all and good luck! #ClassOf2022
RepValDemings,From coast to coast north to south rural and urban male and female Americans are standing up to say: we will not go back. Our bodies are our own. I am with you. I will always support your right to choose. #DefendRoe
RepValDemings,Americans are struggling to feed their families &amp; babies right now because a few big corporations put profits before people. We need strong watchdogs to protect working families.
RepValDemings,This morning I joined the Relentless Empowered Actionable Limitless women of @dstinc1913 to Celebrate Women and develop the leaders of tomorrow. 
RepValDemings,Grateful this #ArmedForcesDay for all the heroes currently serving to protect and defend our democracy.
RepValDemings,If you work hard and play by the rules there should be no reason anyone in the richest country on earth is unable to provide for themselves or their family.
RepValDemings,Our right to privacy to control our own bodies and our own lives – this is fundamental. We refuse to go back. #DefendRoe
RepValDemings,On May 21 1919 the U.S. House of Representatives passes a 19th constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote. We must never go back.
RepValDemings,This week I voted to strengthen the American Dream by connecting more workers with the skills and training they need.
RepValDemings,Over half of the inflation we’re suffering from is caused by corporate profiteering. Florida families shouldn’t be tightening their belts for the sake of corporate profits.
RepValDemings,Anti-terror funding is critical to Central Florida’s residents and travelers. As a Police Chief I used this program. As a representative I’ve fought for it. 
RepValDemings,Floridians have had it with the political games. They need lower gas prices affordable prescriptions and baby formula. Big corporations got us into this mess raking in record profits. They won’t get us out of it unless we step up.
RepValDemings,Hard work in this country should be rewarded with a living wage.
RepValDemings,I will always stand with Florida families. I voted for two bills late last night to attack the baby formula shortage and support efforts to refill shelves. #FeedOurInfants
RepValDemings,We can fight whatever political issues you want - but do not stand in the way of families being able to feed their children. We passed legislation to #FeedOurInfants. Now the Senate must act.
RepValDemings,I voted last night for emergency funding to help get formula back on store shelves. 192 of my fellow House colleagues voted against it but we won’t let them stop us. #FeedOurInfants
RepValDemings,I don't know how my colleagues do it on the other side of the aisle but corporations are not people. I hear from constituents every day about the unbelievable prices that they have to pay. Our primary responsibility is to the American people.  
RepValDemings,Let's not forget the companies that caused the baby formula shortage in the first place. They need to pull out all the stops including around the clock production and fix their mistakes. #FeedOurInfants
RepValDemings,Inflation is a threat to every family. We are working around the clock to bring costs. Today we passed legislation that I helped lead to crack down on gas price gouging.
RepValDemings,The baby formula shortage is a crisis for Florida families caused by corporate negligence insufficient oversight and long-term structural problems. Last night I voted for legislation to hasten production and restock shelves.
RepValDemings,Families across Florida are worried about making ends meet while oil company CEOs boast about record profits. We just passed my bill to crack down on price gouging.
RepValDemings,I am proud to help lead efforts to defend Florida families stop price gouging and investigate corporate bad behavior. 
RepValDemings,I speak every day with families struggling with inflation and higher costs caused by corporate price gouging. I’ve cosponsored new legislation to crack down on price gouging.
RepValDemings,Nothing can bring back the victims of the Buffalo shooting or Pulse or Parkland. But we have a duty to act to stop the next attack. Last night I voted for legislation to monitor investigate and prosecute cases of domestic terror and violent extremism. 
RepValDemings,As a mother and grandmother I have called on the administration to take additional actions which will ramp up formula production and end the shortage. Let’s get this fixed. My statement: 
RepValDemings,May is #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth. Take care of yourself. You matter. Resources are available nationally and within our community. You can find hep and resources here.  #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth
RepValDemings,In the war on women I choose to stand with America’s women. #DefendRoe
RepValDemings,As a police officer I cannot tell you the number of times I may have disagreed with people's personal choices beliefs decisions. But I took an oath to protect them and their Constitutional rights to those decisions and those beliefs.
RepValDemings,I grew up in a rural part of Florida. My mother was in church every Sunday so that meant I was in church every Sunday. My mother taught me to not just listen to a sermon. She taught me to try to be a sermon - to practice what I heard preached. 
RepValDemings,I took an oath as an officer to protect every American &amp; our constitutional rights. Your decisions and your beliefs are our own. Your life your family your religion your circumstances your values your body - it’s yours. Our freedom makes us the greatest nation in the world. 
RepValDemings,Thanks to our Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act thousands of projects across America are under way to rebuild our infrastructure keep Floridians safe and create good new jobs in our communities. 
RepValDemings,Did you ask your congressman's permission before you started your family? I sure didn't. It's your life not theirs. #DefendRoe 
RepValDemings,This week the House will vote to crack down on oil and gas price gouging. This is just one of several bills we’re considering that will bring down costs. Families need help now and we’re going to get it done.
RepValDemings,The vast majority of Americans support a woman’s right to choose her own destiny. A handful of extremists whether in the Supreme Court or the Senate will not dictate our future. #DefendRoe
RepValDemings,In America freedom always wins.The Senate must act. Governors and legislatures must act.Form alliances. Support doctors. Support women. Speak out. Demand action. #DefendRoe 
RepValDemings,Women should not have to share horror stories in order to “earn” basic human rights.
RepValDemings,They want a national ban. They want to punish and control women. They want to put doctors in jail. #DefendRoe
RepValDemings,Remembering Officer Tanja B. King of the @OrlandoPolice. She was killed in the line of duty 22 years ago today. Gone but not forgotten.
RepValDemings,The right to choose the right to control our own futures—this is fundamental to our freedom.
RepValDemings,Liberté égalité fraternité. As cochair of the Haiti Caucus in Congress this #HaitianFlagDay I ask you to pray for the safety and liberty of the people of Haiti.
