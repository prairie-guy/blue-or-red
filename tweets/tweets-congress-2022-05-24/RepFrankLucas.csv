RepFrankLucas,Gas prices in Oklahoma are now the highest they have ever been in Oklahoma history. Oklahomans are now paying roughly $4.041/gallon. Oklahoma's- and America's- record high gas prices reflect Washington Democrats' irresponsible and misguided energy policy.
RepFrankLucas,Instead of offering real solutions to help ease Americans' pain at the pump House Democrats' Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act is a thinly veiled attempt to deflect the effects of the failed policies of the Biden Admin.America must unleash its energy independence.
RepFrankLucas,The Access to Baby Formula Act will provide flexibility to families so that they can purchase safe formula with WIC benefits during these extenuating circumstances.Â For the health and safety of children across Oklahoma the Biden Admin. must address this situation immediately.
RepFrankLucas,Congress and the Administration should be working with the FDA to address the shortage and expand access to programs for families and children in need.The Access to Baby Formula Act which I supported and was passed by the House last night does just that.
RepFrankLucas,Last night the House passed the Infant Formula Supplemental Appropriations Act. There are many things the Administration and Congress can do to help America's families but one thing we shouldn't do is provide a $28 million check to the FDA with no offsets and no real solutions.
RepFrankLucas,Our nation's baby formula shortage is completely outrageous. For the last 3 months families have fallen into the grips of an unacceptable infant formula supply crisis- one that the Biden Admin. had ample opportunity to address before it became life threatening for so many.
RepFrankLucas,Last week oil reserves in the SPR dropped to its lowest level since 1987. Instead of promoting domestic energy production the Biden Admin.'s misguided policies continue to stand in the way of easing Americans' pain at the pumps and embracing an all-of-the-above energy approach.
