RepAngieCraig,This is every parent’s worst nightmare. I’m sickened and heartbroken by this terrible news.But I’m also angry. We don't have to live in a country where murdering elementary school children results in a lot of thoughts and prayers but no real action. 
RepAngieCraig,We must do whatever it takes to resolve these shortages and get formula onto store shelves as soon as possible. This is an important first step – our work is far from over on this important issue. 
RepAngieCraig,Check out this weekend’s @StribOpinion editorial on my efforts in Congress to enact common sense reforms to cap out-of-pocket insulin costs at $35 a month. No American should have to risk their wellbeing by rationing insulin. 
RepAngieCraig,I got to ride along with @DakotaMNSheriff Tim Leslie today. It was a great way to see how our law enforcement connects with our communities and see the job from Sheriff Leslie’s perspective. Thanks again! 
RepAngieCraig,Thank you so much to Shakopee High School for having me today to talk about our shared priorities of supporting special education and promoting career and technical education! Great to meet so many committed young people! 
RepAngieCraig,I met with my Veterans Advisory Council today to discuss how we can better support veteran mental health needs in #MN02. Great to say thank you after to the great folks at the Dakota County Veteran Service Office. 
RepAngieCraig,Bridgette Norring from Hastings lost her son Devin to an overdose from a counterfeit pill purchased on social media. We have to hold big tech and social media companies accountable for the criminals profiting on their platforms.
RepAngieCraig,Today is the last day of #NationalPoliceWeek! Great to stop by the Farmington Police Department Open House today to thank them for their work to keep our communities safe. 
RepAngieCraig,I am proud to have helped pass this crucial piece of legislation out of the House. The rise of domestic terrorism in this country needs to be addressed so that we can keep all of our communities safe.
RepAngieCraig,Members of Congress should not be allowed to own or trade stocks while in office. Even the appearance of impropriety is unacceptable. It's time to pass legislation for a stock trading ban.
RepAngieCraig,Happening today! My town hall on prescription drug pricing starts at noon! If you would like to join you can dial in at 833-364-1471. Talk to you soon!
RepAngieCraig,Gas is too expensive right now. We can’t let big oil pick the pockets of working families. That's why I am proud to have helped pass the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act out of the House. 
RepAngieCraig,Americans deserve elected officials who focus on fighting for their communities not on lining their pockets after their time in Congress. That’s why I introduced legislation to ban Members of Congress from lobbying after their time in public service. Let’s get it done. 
RepAngieCraig,Spring training has begun for the Congressional Women’s Softball Team! Great practice with my colleagues today. I think we’ll definitely give Team Press some trouble this year. 
RepAngieCraig,It’s vital that officers’ benefits programs aren’t just there to protect our law enforcement officers from physical harm – but also from mental injuries they endure in the line of duty. This week I was honored to help pass the Public Safety Officer Support Act in Cory’s memory.
RepAngieCraig,Former South St Paul Police Officer Cory Slifko put his life on the line for his community every day for nearly 20 years. It’s our responsibility to ensure families like his are supported when the worst comes to pass. 
RepAngieCraig,A four-year college degree isn’t for everyone &amp; there are millions of good-paying jobs available for folks without a bachelor's degree. Glad to see career &amp; technical education get the recognition it deserves as a great choice for millions of Americans. 
RepAngieCraig,I continue to prioritize lowering costs for working families and I won't stop until price and supply chain pressures have been resolved.
RepAngieCraig,Today the House Ag Committee passed a series of bills aimed at lowering the price of food and easing food/ag supply chain pressure. I was proud to support them including ones to decrease concentration and address rising input costs.
RepAngieCraig,This Friday at noon I’ll be hosting my May Town Hall focused on the rising cost of prescription drugs &amp; health care. If you would like to join you can dial in at 833-364-1471 – or submit your questions in advance here:
