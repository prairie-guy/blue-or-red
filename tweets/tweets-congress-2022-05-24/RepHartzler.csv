RepHartzler,Girlsâ€™ bathrooms should be for girls. Girlsâ€™ locker rooms should be for girls. Girlsâ€™ sports should be for girls.Itâ€™s time to bring common sense back to this country.Itâ€™s time to stand for women.
RepHartzler,Today a gallon of gas in Missouri costs $4.15.In April 2020 it was $1.44.The Biden administration has singlehandedly killed America's energy independence and caused undue hardship on our nation's families.
RepHartzler,I never thought I would have to stand here as a Member of Congress and introduce legislation defining what a woman or mother is.But this is the reality Democrats want us to live in.Itâ€™s time to stop the madness. 
RepHartzler,A big win for truth and free speech! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
