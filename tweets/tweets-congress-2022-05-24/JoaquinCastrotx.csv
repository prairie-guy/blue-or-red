JoaquinCastrotx,Uvalde is a wonderful tight-knit community west of my hometown of San Antonio. My heart goes out to the community and the families in Uvalde devastated by gun violence today. This is a parent‚Äôs worst nightmare. We need gun reform now. 
JoaquinCastrotx,I'm grateful to The Naming Commission for their recommendation to rename Fort Hood for Richard Cavazos &amp; I urge them to continue honoring the heroism of Hispanic servicemembers by renaming Fort Bragg for Roy Benavidez a profoundly brave soldier whose legacy deserves to live on.
JoaquinCastrotx,Today there are still mainland U.S. military bases named after Confederate generals but not even one named after a Latino military hero.Alongside the @HispanicCaucus I've pushed to rename Fort Hood after a Latino leader. With today's news history is about to change. 
JoaquinCastrotx,Because of @GovAbbott TX was one of the few states that failed to invest in meaningful census outreach.Now Texans have been robbed of a congressional seat &amp; will lose out on billions in federal funding over the next decade for schools hospitals &amp; more.

JoaquinCastrotx,@AOC Congratulations on your engagement!
JoaquinCastrotx,Here‚Äôs your reminder that 192/204 Republicans voted AGAINST emergency funding to address the infant formula shortage.That‚Äôs right 192 Republicans chose their own political agenda over America‚Äôs children. 
JoaquinCastrotx,A big reason gas prices are so high is that oil companies are price gouging Texans to make record profits. In Texas the average price of gas spiked to over $4 per gallon. Diesel is even worse. I voted to hold these companies accountable and end their predatory practices. 
JoaquinCastrotx,@PeteTucker @DayvonLove Excellent article and investigation.Texas‚Äô statewide elected officials are Exhibit A for getting away with corruption/cronyism yet almost never get criminally investigated. And the AG Ken Paxton who was indicted hasn‚Äôt gone to trial for seven years.
JoaquinCastrotx,Like many families in San Antonio &amp; across the country my wife and I understand how nerve-wracking this formula shortage is.¬†I voted to help WIC-enrolled families access safe formula products provide @US_FDA w/resources to #FeedOurInfants &amp; ensure this never happens again. 
JoaquinCastrotx,I've been leading the call for President Biden to invoke the Defense Production Act to solve our nation's formula shortage and I'm relieved to see today's news from the administration. Families are suffering and we need to bring this shortage to an end. 
JoaquinCastrotx,Toxic exposure is a devastating and unacceptable cost of war.¬†As a cosponsor of the House-passed Honoring Our PACT Act I‚Äôm glad to see the Senate reach a bipartisan agreement.I look forward to getting this bill to @POTUS‚Äôs desk &amp; providing veterans the care they deserve. 
JoaquinCastrotx,TEXAS WIC UPDATE:Due to the formula recall many Texans are struggling to find approved powdered formulas. WIC has temporarily expanded its list to include additional formulas so you can get formula for your baby without updating your card.Learn moreüëá
JoaquinCastrotx,As we recover from the pandemic Texans deserve an economy that works for everyone.¬†Today the House voted to pass my legislation to fund workforce development programs like @ProjectQuestInc &amp; expand career services that help domestic violence survivors rebuild their lives. 
JoaquinCastrotx,Trump-era restrictions on remittances travel &amp; immigration visas have hurt Cuban-Americans &amp; their families in Cuba and hurt our national security.I have long called for these restrictions to be lifted and I'm glad to see the administration continue to re-engage with Cuba.
