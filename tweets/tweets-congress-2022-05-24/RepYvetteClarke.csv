RepYvetteClarke,This is truly horrific. There are no words to describe this terrible situation we find ourselves in. This is yet another tragic reminder that we need sensible gun control laws now. My heart goes out to all those impacted by this latest tragedy.
RepYvetteClarke,That part.üëáüèæ 
RepYvetteClarke,By every definition the innocent migrants of Guatemala El Salvador Honduras and Nicaragua meet the circumstances for TPS. I joined with my colleagues to call on the Biden Administration and Secretary Mayorkas to deliver a humanitarian decision that grants it to them. ‚§µÔ∏è‚§µÔ∏è‚§µÔ∏è

RepYvetteClarke,I am so honored to represent the people of the 9th Congressional district of New York. These moments - delivering crucial funding - make the work I champion in Congress incredibly worthwhile and satisfying. #community 
RepYvetteClarke,This ruling is not just troubling it sets a terrible and inhumane precedent. The right to counsel is Constitutionally protected. #SCOTUS 
RepYvetteClarke,Under Title 42 tens of thousands of migrants mostly Black migrants have been expelled at our borders. This health rule is not just blatantly racist it's abhorrent. This legal setback has been a disservice to our American values and stains our humanity. #EndTitle42 
RepYvetteClarke,The impact of Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine on fuel prices is proof that fossil fuels are too volatile to be relied on. We need to build a U.S. energy economy that is truly independent sustainable and affordable - and generated entirely here at home.
RepYvetteClarke,We will fiercely fight to protect our God-given right to govern our own bodies and make decisions about our health care. Full stop. 
RepYvetteClarke,@slaversofny I'm so proud of this WIN!!! üôåüèΩ
RepYvetteClarke,It is truly unconscionable to find ourselves back in this unholy place. Closing our borders to vulnerable people through the use of an inhumane immigration policy like #Title42 - targeting Black migrants - is not just terribly wrong it's racist. 
RepYvetteClarke,We should not honor men who divided this country to defend slavery. My bill Honoring Real Patriots Act of 2017 to rename streets in Brooklyn after Af-Am heroes like 1st Lt. John Earl Warren Jr. will help ensure we don't.Proud to share this WIN!üëáüèæ
RepYvetteClarke,Americans especially those historically stifled and marginalized need immediate relief from the student loan debt crisis. #studentloandebt 
RepYvetteClarke,Grateful for the president's leadership delivering this critical support for families. Invoking the Defense Production Act to increase the U.S. production of baby formula is the right thing to do. 
RepYvetteClarke,Hear hear! Title 42 is an inhumane immigration policy set by the Trump administration to carry out a high volume of expulsions including tens of thousands of Haitian migrants seeking asylum at our borders.

RepYvetteClarke,Asking for help is a strength not a weakness. The world can be a challenging place. Take care of your mental health ‚Äì today and every day. And know that you are not alone. #MentalHealthMonth
RepYvetteClarke,Domestic violent extremists pose a steady and evolving threat of violence to our communities especially to minority communities and institutions. That is why I'm proud to co-sponsor H.R. 350 the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act.
