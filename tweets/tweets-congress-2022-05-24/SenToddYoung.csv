SenToddYoung,The transatlantic alliance has never been more crucial to global security &amp; stability. The addition of these two important allies to NATO will ensure the alliance‚Äôs resilience and readiness &amp; we look forward to welcoming Sweden and Finland to NATO. 
SenToddYoung,Joined @BloombergTV to discuss the baby formula shortage affecting Hoosier families and why Congress must pass my #USICA bill to outcompete the Chinese Communist Party. 
SenToddYoung,We must continue to invest in frontier technologies to create more opportunities for future workers. Congrats to state and local leaders for making this happen.
SenToddYoung,Indiana has the workforce expertise and business environment needed to attract projects like Stellantis‚Äô new battery plant with Samsung.
SenToddYoung,Powerful evidence released today by @VoCommunism &amp; @adrianzenz revealing the horrors occurring in Xinjiang. These are nothing short of modern day concentration camps masquerading as ‚Äúvocational training centers.‚Äù #XinjiangPoliceFiles #BeijingBehavingBadly 
SenToddYoung,I joined @wane15 to discuss my Yes In My Backyard Act which will help solve our housing affordability crisis by increasing transparency around local zoning and land use policies across the country. Read more hereüîΩ
SenToddYoung,I‚Äôm glad the court made the decision to keep #Title42 in place for now but @POTUS is appealing meaning his Administration will waste even more time &amp; taxpayer dollars pursuing this disastrous plan. We must keep #Title42 in place if we want to secure our southern border.
SenToddYoung,Title 42 is one of the best tools our border enforcement has to stem the tide of illegal immigration. It is no surprise that the Biden Administration met bipartisan opposition when it threatened to end #Title42.
SenToddYoung,The Indiana Racing Memorial Association dedicated this marker in Shelbyville to honor Wilbur Shaw a native Hoosier and three-time Indy 500 winner. Following World War II Shaw helped rescue the speedway and served as @IMS president. #MarkerMonday

SenToddYoung,Our police officers on the front lines make sacrifices every day to keep Hoosiers safe.¬†During #NationalPoliceWeek several legislative proposals that I cosponsored in support of Indiana‚Äôs law enforcement¬†community advanced¬†in the Senate. 
SenToddYoung,Americans are struggling to buy groceries pay for record high gas prices and find baby formula and now the Biden administration says it needs $2 billion because of its own decision to unnecessarily lift Title 42.
SenToddYoung,I also commend the individuals and families in Indiana and across our country who provide safe and loving homes to foster children.
SenToddYoung,I helped introduce a resolution recognizing #NationalFosterCareMonth to raise awareness about the challenges foster youth face and express my commitment to supporting those in foster care.
SenToddYoung,As President Biden visits Asia it is crucial that he emphasizes the need to support Taiwan‚Äôs defense and build upon the lessons learned from Ukraine. Together we must deter China‚Äôs aggression toward Taiwan.
