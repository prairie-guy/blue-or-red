RepMaryMiller,President Trump was right to withdraw the US from the corrupt China-controlled World Health Organization. The Biden Admin is selling us out to the Chinese Communist Party! 
RepMaryMiller,We know the Biden White House was coordinating with the NSBA on this letter did the Biden White House suggest trying to use the military to stop parents from attending school board meetings?
RepMaryMiller,I proudly led the effort to withdraw Illinois from the NSBA because they worked with the Biden Admin to accuse parents of domestic terrorism for speaking out at school board meetings.
RepMaryMiller,Today we introduced legislation to defend our daughters by defining gender as we have known it since Genesis. We are made in the image of God as man or woman and no woke ideology can change that. 
RepMaryMiller,In Congress I will always stand up for our Second Amendment. That is why I voted against H.R. 8 also known as the “universal” background check bill which seeks to criminalize the private transfer of firearms. We must protect law-abiding gun owners and our Second Amendment!
RepMaryMiller,Governor Pritzker is refusing to work with ICE to deport dangerous illegal immigrants but has no problem violating the Second Amendment rights of the citizens he swore an oath to defend.
RepMaryMiller,The crime wave in Illinois is the result of Governor Pritzker using COVID to release inmates and refusing to accept inmate transfers from county prisons and his work eliminating cash bail to put offenders right back on the street.
RepMaryMiller,"Governor Pritzker cares more about providing ""sanctuary state"" benefits to non-citizen illegal aliens than defending the Second Amendment rights of the citizens he swore an oath to serve."
RepMaryMiller,Governor Pritzker is once again targeting law-abiding gun owners by banning certain firearms when his soft-on-crime policies caused the crime wave in Illinois.
