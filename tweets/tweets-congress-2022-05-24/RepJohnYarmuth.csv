RepJohnYarmuth,Five years after capturing his first it’s another @PGAChampionship win for Louisville’s own @JustinThomas34. I’ve had the honor of watching this young man play for nearly 20 years and he just keeps getting better. Congratulations JT!
RepJohnYarmuth,Had a blast surprising this year's Congressional Art Competition winners this morning. Congratulations to @AHSRockets senior Anna Gardone and @atherton_high senior Heidi Anderson on their outstanding artwork!  
RepJohnYarmuth,I'm glad we have a Governor who is laser-focused on emerging from this pandemic stronger than before creating good jobs looking out for one another and investing in Kentucky families. This history-making low unemployment rate is more great news for our Commonwealth.
