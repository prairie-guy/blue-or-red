SenatorTester,Heartbroken to hear of the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Texas. Sharla and I grieve for these children and their families and we're sending prayers and strength to those injured. This is senseless and sickening and it's got to end.
SenatorTester,This is big news folks. And it's a big step forward in showing all Americans our plan to deliver toxic-exposed veterans and their families the comprehensive health care and benefits they've earned. The work is not over but I won't stop fighting until it's done. 
SenatorTester,I also hosted a roundtable discussion with @SecDebHaaland @AsstSecNewland @USFWS Director Martha Williams and leaders from Tribes across Montana. It's critical that our governments work together to build a stronger future. 
SenatorTester,Was an honor to celebrate the Bison Range Restoration with the CSKT on Friday and I'm proud to have worked with the Tribes Montanans and my colleagues to get it done. It's been a long time coming and I'll keep working to ensure we uphold our trust and treaty responsibilities. 
SenatorTester,Pleased to see @USDA roll out the disaster relief payments I fought to secure for our hardworking producers—who have been hit with devastating drought and wildfires the last two years.This was long overdue and we need to keep the pressure on USDA to get this out the door ASAP.
SenatorTester,We need to reign in these outrageous prescription drug costs to help folks save money. And we can do that for so many right now by capping the price of insulin.
SenatorTester,Our drive to airport this morning. Pre sunrise of the Bear Paw mountains. Gorgeous. - Sharla 
SenatorTester,A big congratulations to Mrs. Jernigan's whip-smart students at C.S. Porter Middle School for their Top 10 finish in @SIFMAFoundation's Capitol Hill Challenge! Missoula's got a bright future ahead with these kids at the helm.
SenatorTester,Thrilled to be at the Rocky Mountain Building in Great Falls where we're investing $2.6M from my bipartisan infrastructure law to clean up pollution and jump-start redevelopment.Redevelopment is critical for long-term economic growth so thanks to the GFDA for leading the way. 
SenatorTester,McLaughlin Research Institute does cutting-edge biomedical science research right here in Great Falls—helping address complex challenges like Alzheimer's Parkinson's and other devastating diseases. Critically important work happens here and I'm grateful to see it firsthand. 
SenatorTester,Morning radio in the Electric City. STAR Max Country and KMON—great chatting with you and your listeners! 
SenatorTester,Always great to be in Great Falls. Kicked off my day talking ag consolidation toxic exposure legislation and more with @ColterAnstaett at @KRTV. Thanks for having me! 
SenatorTester,ICYMI the CDC is sending out another round of free at-home COVID tests to anyone that wants them. Regular testing is a critical tool for keeping us on track to put this thing behind us—so order yours at 
SenatorTester,On Armed Forces Day we salute the men and women in uniform who have stepped up and answered the call of duty to defend our families freedoms and way of life. God bless.
SenatorTester,Today I had the honor of meeting Vern Olson a 101-year old WWII veteran who received the very first Fort Harrison coin. It's critical that we get our vets like Vern the care and benefits they earned and I’ll keep working to make sure they do.Thank you for your service Vern. 
SenatorTester,Can't think of a better way to spend a Friday than with the Helena area veterans community and the first-rate VA staff celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Fort Harrison Veterans Hospital.This facility changes lives and I'll always fight to get it the resources it needs. 
SenatorTester,This Police Week we honor the heroic officers who risk their lives to keep us safe. But words aren’t enough we’ve got to have their backs every day—and the best way to do that is by making sure they’ve got the resources they need to do their jobs &amp; keep our communities safe.
SenatorTester,Montana is booming and it’s critical that we have the up-to-date infrastructure to support our growing economy.That's why we're investing another $13.6M in 19 airports across the Treasure State—keeping Montanans connected and supporting good-paying jobs here at home.
SenatorTester,This is dangerous and extreme and would rob women of a right they have had for nearly 50 years. No government should control a woman's health care decision like this. 
SenatorTester,Whether it's meatpacking or infant formula consolidation leads to tighter margins for producers and higher costs for consumers.That's why @SenBooker @SenJeffMerkley @SenWarren and I introduced a bill to halt big ag mergers and put family farmers back in the drivers' seat.
SenatorTester,77% of Montanans said the lack of affordable housing is a serious problem in our state right now.I've been laser-focused on finding more ways for the federal government to increase housing supply so I'm encouraged to see @POTUS put out a plan this week to help do just that.
SenatorTester,"Rep. Austin Scott said my bipartisan Meat Packing Special Investigator Act had ""probably been written by somebody who's not been a farmer before.""@AustinScottGA08—I'm a third-generation farmer and I wrote the bill. Nice to meet you. "
SenatorTester,Ladd Paulson is a retired Billings Police Officer who was injured in the line of duty. Now he and his wife Heidi advocate for commonsense bills that'll help disabled officers get the benefits they've earned—bills like my Putting First Responders First Act. Let's get it passed! 
SenatorTester,BIG NEWS: The House companion for my Meat Packing Special Investigator Act just passed out of the House Agriculture Committee.We're a big step closer to cracking down on unfair practices that are driving up consumer costs and bankrupting our family ranchers.
SenatorTester,Talked infrastructure affordable housing and labor issues with local officials from Kalispell and Flathead County. Our local governments understand the issues on the ground best so it's critical we work together to tackle the issues facing Big Sky Country. 
SenatorTester,More good news for Montana vets! This week VA began rolling-out an initiative created under my Hannon Act to improve research to deliver more veterans tailored quality mental health care. 
SenatorTester,This is a great day for our veterans—and it's only because of the vets' and the VSOs' tireless advocacy that we've gotten here.I'm going to keep fighting until Congress pays the cost of war and passes this comprehensive legislation onto the President's desk for his signature.
SenatorTester,For too long our nation's veterans have been living with chronic conditions as a result of exposures during their time in uniform. Today we're taking the necessary steps to provide them their earned benefits and care.
SenatorTester,We've got a deal—@JerryMoran and I reached a bipartisan agreement today on the most comprehensive toxic exposure package we've ever delivered for our nation's veterans.Together we're going to deliver ALL generations of toxic-exposed vets their earned benefits and care. 
SenatorTester,Good news: Jesse Laslovich was just unanimously confirmed by the Senate to serve as Montana's U.S. Attorney.Jesse is a lifelong Montanan who will root out corruption and defend our local communities.
