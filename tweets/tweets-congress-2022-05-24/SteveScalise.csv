SteveScalise,We now have a President who:- Promotes catch &amp; release- Halted wall construction- Ended Remain in Mexico- Cut deportations to a 26-year lowThe result?Illegal crossings up 1268% from 2 years ago.The cartels are laughing.My op-ed w/ @RepBentz ↓ 
SteveScalise,WATCH → Biden refers to the skyrocketing gas prices as an “incredible transition.” They’re saying the quiet part out loud now. They’re causing you pain at the pump because it’s all part of their radical agenda. 
SteveScalise,This confirms what we already knew: Biden’s reckless political move to appease the Left with a wide open border violates the law &amp; his duty to keep Americans safe.Keeping Title 42 means less illegal immigration &amp; less fentanyl killing young Americans. 
SteveScalise,"Reminder: Just a few weeks ago Biden's Homeland Security Secretary testified under oath that we have ""operational control"" of the border.They're blatantly lying to you.Will the disinformation board be addressing this? "
