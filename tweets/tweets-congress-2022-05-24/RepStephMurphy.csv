RepStephMurphy,There are no words.
RepStephMurphy,ICYMI: I visited the Little Wekiva River after securing nearly $700K in federal funding to restore this once-thriving ecosystem. See the news story from @fox35orlando ðŸ‘‡ 
RepStephMurphy,The Trump tariffs contribute to inflation harm U.S. families &amp; companies &amp; havenâ€™t stopped the CCP from violating trade rules. The Biden administration should repeal or reduce these tariffs. Keeping a failed policy in place isnâ€™t tough on China; itâ€™s bad for America. 
RepStephMurphy,Glad to be back at the Little Wekiva River after securing nearly $700K in federal funding to restore it. This will help bring the dried and degraded river back to life enabling residents to once again enjoy this local treasure.

RepStephMurphy,I endorse this historic effortâ€”supported by Puerto Ricoâ€™s Governor and Resident Commissionerâ€”to end the unequal undemocratic status quo on the island. I hope the people of PR choose statehood. It would improve quality of life on the island &amp; be good for our nation.
