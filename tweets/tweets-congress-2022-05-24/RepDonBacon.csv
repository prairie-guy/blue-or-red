RepDonBacon,Real wages have DECREASED since Biden took office.  
RepDonBacon,#NationalBeefMonth

RepDonBacon,Here is ‚ÄúA Day in the Life‚Äù of a Congressman! Some days may be less busy than others but one thing is certain‚ÄîTeam Bacon enjoys representing the great people of #NE02. 
RepDonBacon,Instead of loosening US drilling restrictions Biden is joining Putin and Xi in propping up Venezuelan dictator Maduro. These oil profits will fuel kleptocracy and hurt Venezuelans who Maduro jails executes and tortures. He is an enemy of democracy.  
RepDonBacon,@ArmyGrunt05 We have a President who waged war against US fossil fuel. He campaigned on it did it now we have high prices.
RepDonBacon,@MCC_History_ Our intelligence community also had concerns about using intelligence dollars to track Americans. Further Biden admin undermined trust with considering targeting parents as terrorists.
RepDonBacon,Since COVID many Americans with Medicare were unable to receive dental rehabilitation services due to the lack of billing options. I joined my colleagues in writing a letter to CMS asking them to create a billing code and alleviate this financial issue immediately.

RepDonBacon,Iranians want a government that respects their human rights. Iranians want freedom and a government that they can respect. We hope to see someday soon an Iran that safeguards its citizens freedoms that is secular nuclear weapons free and at peace with its neighbors. 
RepDonBacon,Glad to be a cosponsor of the Protect and Serve Act. Our law enforcement put their lives on the line to protect our communities. This bill establishes a new criminal offense for knowingly assaulting or attempting to cause serious bodily injury to a police officer. #BacktheBlue 
RepDonBacon,ICYMI: @RepCarbajal and my firefighters bill passed last week. Firefighters suffer higher risk of cancer because of the smoke and toxic fumes they encounter while on duty. We need to support our firefighters who protect us.
