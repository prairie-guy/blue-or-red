RepDebDingell,14 children and one teacher dead. What is wrong with this country that we so often witness murder like this. No other country has this amount of violence. Something has to happen. Words don’t matter only action does and we must do something.
RepDebDingell,Joined the @GREconClub with my friend @RepFredUpton to discuss the current political climate &amp; how we can come together to get important work done.  There are many issues that matter to us all &amp; if we approach them in the right way we can cut through the gridlock.
RepDebDingell,This #NationalPoliceWeek we remember the too many police officers who have given their lives in service to our communities. In honor of their lives and work we must recommit to working together to build bonds between communities and law enforcement to keep us all safer.
RepDebDingell,Additionally these horrific numbers reinforce the need for Congress to develop a sound federal framework for the safe development and deployment of autonomous vehicles.
RepDebDingell,The year 2021 was the highest number of traffic fatalities in the US since 2005. These striking numbers underscore the importance of the #BipartisanInfrastructureLaw which is already taking significant steps in making our roadways safer.
RepDebDingell,Big Oil is ripping off hard-working families while reaping record profits and using it to benefit executives and shareholders as Americans struggle. Today the House acted to lower prices by stopping price gouging penalizing market manipulation &amp; bringing transparency. 
RepDebDingell,Congressional Democrats and @POTUS have acted to address the baby formula shortage with the urgency this crisis deserves. Nearly all Republicans tried to block our efforts while offering ZERO meaningful solutions all so they can score political pointsShameful. 
RepDebDingell,Democratic policies WORK! Under @POTUS’ leadership unemployment claims have dropped to their lowest level since 1969! And we plan to build on this historic growth by #BuildingABetterAmerica from the bottom up &amp; middle out. 
RepDebDingell,The world has been through a lot in the past few years &amp; things can feel overwhelming. This #MentalHealthMonth make sure to take care of yourself &amp; check in with your loved ones. Check out these great free/low-cost services that may be available to you!  
RepDebDingell,Last night I voted for critical legislation to address the infant formula shortage and take important steps to ensure it never happens again.  Thankful Democrats were able to get this bill passed in the House despite Republican attempts to block it and keep shelves empty.
RepDebDingell,Together with legislation we will pass in the House tonight Democrats are using every tool the federal government has to address this crisis that was brought on by baby formula recalls &amp; disruptions to the supply chain.
RepDebDingell,.@POTUS made the right call using the Defense Production Act to ramp up the production of baby formula. This move will speed the delivery of critical supplies to manufacturers to get shelves restocked.
RepDebDingell,EMS workers put their lives on the line every day to serve our communities. During National #EMSWeek we thank our nation’s EMS workforce for their dedication &amp; numerous sacrifices &amp; commit to fighting for better pay benefits &amp; working conditions. 
RepDebDingell,#EqualPay for equal work! 
RepDebDingell,This week Democrats in Congress are taking action to address the infant formula shortage. This is a crisis and Republicans either need to get on board or get out of the way. 
RepDebDingell,Workers need new skills to compete in the modern economy. That’s why I voted for the Workforce Innovation &amp; Opportunity Act which will help workers gain the skills they need to access better-paying jobs in high-demand occupations.  #InvestinginWorkers 
RepDebDingell,Love seeing @AlzAssociation walking the halls of Congress again to discuss the importance of continued federal support for research to combat Alzheimer’s disease. Proud to continue to be a strong advocate in Congress to improve support and outcomes for patients and families.
