RepSpeier,I refuse to participate in another moment of silence on the House floor. I want a moment of action:1) no guns for anyone under 21;2) all guns must have trigger locks that require finger print to be discharged;3) felony charges for anyone who doesn’t safely lock their gun.
RepSpeier,As Chair of the Military Personnel Subcommittee I’m honored to serve our brave servicemembers. Words are not enough to express our country’s gratitude to you &amp; your families. While this is #ArmedForcesDay we owe you better health care living conditions &amp; resources every day. 
RepSpeier,Hear my conversation w/ @davidaxelrod on the Axe Files covering some of the most pressing national issues including abortion &amp; gun violence!
