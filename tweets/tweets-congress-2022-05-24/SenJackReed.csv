SenJackReed,Injustice to any is injustice to all: we must continue to organize &amp; fight against voter suppression laws &amp; tactics that are designed to muffle the voices of Black people &amp; minority communities hinder people's right to vote &amp; undermine our democracy.

SenJackReed,Today only a handful of Senate Republicans supported bipartisan relief for Main Street &amp; local restaurants. Unfortunately majority of Republicans prioritize Wall Street interests above #smallbiz &amp; hard working Americans.
