RepJimCooper,This is just gut-wrenching. Another school targeted in a mass shooting. More innocent children lost. More grieving families who will never hug their children again. What will it take for Republicans to support ANY measure to stop the senseless gun violence in America? 
RepJimCooper,Father Breen was one of the finest men and finest priests Iâ€™ve ever known. I was proud to have him as my guest for the visit of Pope Francis to Congress.He will be sorely missed.
