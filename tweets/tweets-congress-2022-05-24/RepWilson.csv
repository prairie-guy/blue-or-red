RepWilson,Another day another tragedy and still no action to protect our kids. How many more of our youngest must pay the price before our Republican colleagues finally grow a backbone and join us in action to curb the gun violence epidemic and protect our communities? 
RepWilson,But these are not the only countries going through tremendous moments of difficulty right now. We must continue to protect TPS protections for Venezuelans and Haitian migrants and remain a bastion of freedom for the Caribbean and Latin America.
RepWilson,South Florida is a diverse and welcoming home for those fleeing violence or instability across Latin America. I‚Äôm proud to stand with my colleagues in calling for @POTUS to continue TPS protections for our neighbors from Honduras Guatemala El Salvador and Nicaragua. 
RepWilson,Representation matters ‚Äì especially when those in statewide office are trying to reduce the representation of our Black community. As a former Florida House member I am so proud to congratulate @FentriceForFL  on being the first Black woman to lead @FLHouseDems. 
RepWilson,During #NationalFosterCareMonth we recognize the tremendous impact foster parenting can have on the lives of our children most in need. With over 120000 foster kids awaiting adoption nationwide consider making a difference in the life of a child today. 
RepWilson,Thank you to @POTUS for acting quickly on legislation passed by @HouseDemocrats to get formula on store shelves and to our families! 
RepWilson,This Armed Forces Day we recognize the soldiers airmen sailors and other uniformed service members who serve our country proudly. God bless them and God bless our county! üá∫üá∏ 
RepWilson,Approaching transportation needs through an equity lens can have huge impacts on accessibility quality of life safety and economic opportunities for all Americans. I applaud @USDOT for heeding my calls and working to reinstate the Advisory Committee on Transportation Equity. 
RepWilson,Today is Florida Emancipation Day ‚Äì the day news of the end of the Civil War reached our state &amp; freedom spread to formerly enslaved persons! This is a reminder that information is freedom &amp; no attempts to remove uncomfortable truths from our history textbooks will change that. 
RepWilson,The Republican obstructionist agenda continues. Even as families everywhere struggle to fill their gas tank to get to work and take their kids to school they refuse to vote for common-sense legislation that will help our constituents. Americans deserve better. 
RepWilson,While parents across the country go from store to store desperately searching for formula 192 House Republicans just voted against $28M to address this shortage. Remember this moment and remember their votes.Families need action not politics. Shame on them! #FeedOurInfants
RepWilson,While Americans are struggling to fill their tanks Big Oil is making billions in profits. That's why I‚Äôm voting for the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act to end price gouging and stop them from #RippingOffAmericans. 
RepWilson,The @MiamiHEAT are off to a strong start in the Eastern Conference Finals ‚Äì making us proud. Let‚Äôs go Heat! üî•

RepWilson,As the Chair of the #PortsCaucus I've worked tirelessly to advocate for restoring the two-year #WRDA2022 reauthorization and supporting projects at ports across Florida including @PortEverglades @PortMiami @PortCanaveral and @JAXPORT.

RepWilson,Today I joined @TransportDems to markup #WRDA2022 which helps communities throughout South Florida invest in their water resources infrastructure in anticipation of future needs‚Äîespecially as climate change worsens. Together we can save lives and resources.üßµ 
RepWilson,Families in South Florida are feeling the pain and stress of the infant formula shortage firsthand.¬†Today I am voting with @HouseDemocrats to get the FDA the resources it needs to address this shortage &amp; help prevent it from ever happening again. #FeedOurInfants 
RepWilson,I am proud to represent one of the largest Haitian-American communities in the country. Now more than ever Haiti needs our support and guidance to get through these difficult times and emerge a more democratic prosperous and unified country.
RepWilson,The Haitian Flag was born out of an act of defiance ‚Äì sown from pieces of a French flag as a symbol of independence. Today we commemorate #HaitianFlagDay by bringing our community together in celebration of this unifying symbol of the Haitian people‚Äôs independent spirit. 
RepWilson,I've seen with my own eyes how poweful it can be to give our children a head start on their education. As a former Head Start educator and coordinator for @MDCPS I will fight to keep and expand this program every chance I get.
RepWilson,Project @NatlHeadStart ‚Äî launched 57 years ago today ‚Äî was created to address educational inequity and ensure every child has a chance to succeed.Since then it‚Äôs helped 39+ million children and reduced the burden on working mothers and families nationwide. #HappyBDayHeadStart 
RepWilson,Last year I led 3 hearings on the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act‚Äôs youth programs and their impact on our nation‚Äôs workforce. I‚Äôm proud to vote today to be #InvestinginWorkers and provide Americans with jobs education training and the support they need to succeed.
