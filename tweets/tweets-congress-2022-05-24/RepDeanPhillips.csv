RepDeanPhillips,Iâ€™m a gun owner. Do not tell me our Founders conceived of this carnage when they wrote the Constitution. Do not tell me they would have tolerated this madness. Do not tell me that teachers must be armed. And do not tell me your AR15 is worth more than another 14 childrenâ€™s lives.
RepDeanPhillips,Parents kissed their kids this morning after breakfast wished them a good day and theyâ€™ll never see them again. Shot to death in school. IN SCHOOL! Only in America does this carnage happen. Every damn month. May their memories be for a blessing and may we stop this madness. 
RepDeanPhillips,If we wish to protect the truth we must protect the journalists who risk their lives to uncover it for the world. Should this report be true I condemn the killing and inexcusable lack of transparency and expect those responsible to be held to account. 
RepDeanPhillips,Officers like Emily Jepson of the @EdinaPolice with whom I recently rode along during one of her shifts. Her principled and compassionate service is exactly what America should be celebrating.  
RepDeanPhillips,We must recruit a new generation of principled Americans from diverse backgrounds to protect and serve our communities. Gratitude to my 5 Republican and 4 Democratic colleagues whoâ€™ve signed on as original co-sponsors of my bill to do so. #bipartisan 
RepDeanPhillips,Americans of all ages and politics should watch this in its entirety before the consequences of ignorance moral corruption and false prophets make other issues of the day seem petty by comparison. 
RepDeanPhillips,Democracy will prevail in The United States of America. 
RepDeanPhillips,From my father who served in the Army in Vietnam to these remarkable men and women serving on the Navyâ€™s @USSHARRYSTRUMAN I salute all whoâ€™ve made great sacrifices to defend the United States and freedom for over two centuries on #ArmedForcesDay. 
RepDeanPhillips,Truth: There are thousands of unused leases in the USA and little stopping oil companies from drilling more domestically - other than financial risk intolerance and a love of high market prices. Thatâ€™s how they earned ~$300 in PROFIT off each of Americaâ€™s 228mm drivers last year.
RepDeanPhillips,All true. Americans enjoy some of the lowest prices in the world. But most families canâ€™t absorb the extra $1000+ annual cost let alone a $500 car repair. Itâ€™s time to seriously consider a middle income tax cut &amp; ensure Americaâ€™s wealthiest people &amp; businesses pay a fair share. 
RepDeanPhillips,The best tools available to reduce inflation and ease the worker shortage is to reduce trade barriers (tariffs) and reform our immigration system. Congress and the Administration can achieve both but we need our leaders to forgo politics in favor of problem solving.
RepDeanPhillips,Last night before traveling I tested positive for COVID-19. Iâ€™m vaccinated boosted experiencing mild symptoms and will isolate in Washington according to CDC and House Physician guidance. Stay safe get vaccinated and order your free test kits at: 
RepDeanPhillips,What an ignorant and despicable message. Investigating an insurrection inspired and enabled by a defeated president and vice-chaired by one of the nationâ€™s most prominent conservative Republicans is principled - not partisan. 
RepDeanPhillips,Yesterday Senate Republicans blocked our $48 billion small business relief measure for hard-hit American entrepreneurs just hours after approving $40 billion in aid for Ukrainians. Think about that for a minute. #RRF 
RepDeanPhillips,Certain votes separate the wheat from the chaff and this crew is 100% gluten free. 
RepDeanPhillips,This morning I joined a small bipartisan group of colleagues to introduce a resolution urging the Biden Administration to immediately invoke the Defense Production Act to increase production of baby formula. This evening the White House announced it will do just that.  
RepDeanPhillips,Days after a white nationalist massacred black Americans in Buffalo Iâ€™m on the floor of the US House for debate of the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act and am flabbergasted by the depths of ignorance and de-facto enabling of hate by certain members of our Congress.
RepDeanPhillips,@HeyButtHead2 While I agree the wealthiest Americans and most successful enterprises must pay their fair share only competition can ensure the lowest prices highest quality and ample supplies of the goods and services on which we rely.
RepDeanPhillips,America is great when America is good. So letâ€™s turn-up the good.ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
