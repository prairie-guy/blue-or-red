RepHaleyStevens,So proud to announce that my office has returned over $100 million to MI-11 families through my constituent services team resolving over 5000 cases with federal agencies! If you need help with a federal agency my office is here to be your advocate. Give us a call 734-853-3040. 
RepHaleyStevens,The Biden-Harris Administration knows that families across the country are worried about finding enough formula to feed their babies and are working around-the-clock to increase production and keep shelves stocked. Thank you @POTUS! 
RepHaleyStevens,@RepTroyCarter Congrats!

RepHaleyStevens,#OTD in 1919 the House passed the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote. I‚Äôm so grateful to the suffragists for their work to advance women‚Äôs rights and I‚Äôm so proud of all the women today who are following in their footsteps and advocating for choice.
RepHaleyStevens,On #ArmedForcesDay we thank our service members across all branches for their defense of our country and of our founding ideals. We are forever indebted to you for your bravery and courage!
RepHaleyStevens,I completely agree with @RepDeanPhillips. The @January6thCmte which includes two Republicans who have now been denounced by their own party is doing important work to uncover the events that led to that dark day. This is about safeguarding Democracy not party. 
RepHaleyStevens,Huge thank you to everyone involved especially our expert witnesses from the @UAW @MacombCollege @MichiganLEO and the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program. Your testimony will surely help as we move to position the United States at the center of growth for EV‚Äôs.
RepHaleyStevens,The future of electric innovation depends on a strong diverse and skilled technical workforce. Today I gaveled in from Pontiac to hold a @HouseScience field hearing to explore workforce needs of the industry electric vehicle industry. 
RepHaleyStevens,Incredible testimony from Ms. Marcia Black-Watson of @MichiganLEO on barriers to entry and how to overcome them. Thank you Marcia! 
RepHaleyStevens,‚ÄúThe first most fundamental thing is making sure workers have the ability to have a voice on the job. When workers have a voice you have more investment better jobs &amp; better retention. Pass the PRO Act which the House has already done &amp; the Senate really needs to do too.‚Äù @UAW 
RepHaleyStevens,You heard it here! Now‚Äôs the time to become an electrician and to be an electrician. Thank you for your testimony Ms. Medford! #EVITP

RepHaleyStevens,Congress must prioritize and take action to renovate modernize and repair America‚Äôs schools. Yesterday during an @EdLaborCmte markup I spoke on the Rebuilding America‚Äôs Schools Act and encouraged my colleagues to support it. #MI11 needs this funding! 
RepHaleyStevens,Proud to vote for @RepSchneider's bill yesterday the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act. This bill takes meaningful steps to combat the rise of domestic terrorism by authorizing offices within the DHS DOJ and FBI to monitor and report on the state of domestic terrorism.
RepHaleyStevens,It's absolutely unacceptable that Americans are being squeezed at the gas pump while Big Oil is profiting.¬†The Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act lowers costs for consumers by putting an end to price gouging and penalizing market manipulators. Stevens voted yes.
RepHaleyStevens,"With all due respect we have been working alongside the Whelan family for 4 years. Two unanimous House resolutions have been passed. Multiple heart wrenching press conferences. Countless radio print and tv interviews. Hundreds of social media posts. Are we not ""loud"" enough? "

RepHaleyStevens,In the wake of 8 tragic mass shootings in 72 hours I'm proud to introduce the Accountability for Online Firearms Marketplaces Act with @RepJasonCrow @RepKatiePorter &amp; @RepJeffries. This bill requires background checks and ends blanket immunity for online firearms marketplaces.
