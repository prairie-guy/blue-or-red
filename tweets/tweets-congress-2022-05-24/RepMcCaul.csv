RepMcCaul,I‚Äôd like to extend my prayers and deepest sympathies to the children staff and families affected by today‚Äôs tragic shooting in Uvalde. My office is monitoring the situation and are thankful to our law enforcement officers for their swift action.
RepMcCaul,A record number of illegal immigrants human traffickers and deadly drugs are surging across our southern border thanks to the Biden administration‚Äôs reckless policies. Biden has refused to enforce border security and ending Title 42 would only make this crisis worse. 
RepMcCaul,Enjoyed meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Moldova Kent Logsdon during my trip to the country where we toured one of Moldova‚Äôs largest refugee centers. Thank you Moldova for your support for Ukraine in the face of Putin‚Äôs brutality. 
RepMcCaul,Today I will be participating in a panel at the World Economic Forum to discuss recent geopolitical shifts from a Ukrainian Russian North American and Asian perspective. #WEF22 Tune in here at 8:45amET/7:45amCT ‚¨áÔ∏è 
RepMcCaul,My CHIPS act would spur tens of billions in additional investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing improving our security and creating thousands of jobs.
RepMcCaul,It‚Äôs critical to our national security that we ramp up U.S. production of advanced semiconductor chips and Texas is the best choice for manufacturing and development. 
RepMcCaul,God bless the men and women in uniform who bravely serve and sacrifice to protect our freedoms. We especially honor them today on #ArmedForcesDay.
RepMcCaul,The Federal Courts decision to block the Biden admin. from ending Title 42 is a big win for border security. With a record number of over 234000 migrant encounters in April now is not the time to allow @POTUS to cause more chaos at our southern border.
RepMcCaul,The fentanyl rampantly flowing across our southern border knows no bounds as teenage overdose death tragically skyrocket. This administration cannot ignore that our open border has deadly consequences for American families. 
RepMcCaul,Happy Vyshyvanka Day! Today we celebrate Ukrainian tradition culture and long history of strength that we still see today. Proud to stand with Ukraine today and every day üá∫üá¶ 
RepMcCaul,It was great to meet with childhood cancer advocates and the childhood cancer community. I helped introduce the Give Kids a Chance Act to give kids a better chance at survival from this disease. This issue is close to my heart and these kids will always be my priority. 
RepMcCaul,There were 234088 migrants encountered at the southern border in April. That‚Äôs the highest number in DHS history yet the Biden administration is still pushing to end Title 42 next week. President Biden must enforce border security.
RepMcCaul,Tune in! I‚Äôm joining @washingtonpost now to discuss securing our cyberspace! Don‚Äôt miss it‚¨áÔ∏è 
RepMcCaul,Great to meet with PM Mitsotakis! His joint session was inspiring. Greece is continuing its strong history of defending democracy in its support of Ukraine. I look forward to future conversations about how the üá∫üá∏ &amp; üá¨üá∑ can work together to advance European energy diversification.
