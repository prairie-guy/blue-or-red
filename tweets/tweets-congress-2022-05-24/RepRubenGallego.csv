RepRubenGallego,Ten days after a hateful mass shooting in Buffalo 14 school children and a teacher are killed in Uvalde. We have surrendered our communities and our children to an endless parade of tragedy. Enough with the thoughts and prayers: we must take action and confront gun violence.
RepRubenGallego,Putin's disastrous invasion of Ukraine is what happens when one man holds unchecked power. Democracy is the best and only way to prevent dictatorship. We must protect it here in the U.S. and continue promoting it abroad. 
RepRubenGallego,.@HouseDemocrats heard the needs of the American people &amp; last week we voted to make gas cheaper boost baby formula production and combat domestic terrorism and white supremacist violence.Republicans opposed these bills almost unanimously. They talk #DemocratsDeliver.
RepRubenGallego,In April I pushed Gov. Ducey to use American Rescue Plan funds to offset high gas prices. These are concrete steps we can take to reduce the impact of Putin's war and price gouging and I won't let up in working to get Arizonans the relief they deserve. 
RepRubenGallego,The vote was yet another way I'm working for Arizonans. On Monday I called on the IRS to increase the mileage deduction rate to ease the impact high gas prices have on small businesses ride-share drivers and self-employed individuals. 
RepRubenGallego,Oil company CEOs are recording soaring profits while hardworking Arizonans get squeezed at the gas pump. Today @HouseDemocrats acted to penalize market manipulators and reduce exploitative price gouging.
RepRubenGallego,Black and brown communities have experienced violence at the hand of extremism stemming from racism and white supremacy.Surrendering to this continued violence is not an option. We must respond and that’s why today I voted to pass the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act.
RepRubenGallego,In the Marines I slept next to a burn pit. I cannot overstate how important it is get veterans exposed to toxic burn pits the care they deserve. News of the Senate’s progress is encouraging. Let’s get the Honoring our PACT Act signed into law.
RepRubenGallego,We mourn the 1 million lives lost to COVID-19. It’s important we also honor them with action. Please do what is necessary to keep one another safe. Get boosted and head to  to order a 3rd round of free COVID-19 tests.
