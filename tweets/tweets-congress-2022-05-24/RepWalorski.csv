RepWalorski,As we learn more about today's senseless attack in Uvalde Texas I am devastated for the children families and community members who are grieving. Violence has no place in our nation's schools - or anywhere else. We must work together to protect our kids.
RepWalorski,I'm glad to see the Indiana General Assembly act to protect the integrity of girls’ sports. As a young Hoosier growing up in Northern Indiana I experienced firsthand the benefits of girls’ sports. We must continue to protect these athletic opportunities for girls and women.
RepWalorski,The ongoing baby formula shortage is a terrifying crisis for American moms and families. I co-sponsored the Babies Need Formula Now Act to address President Biden’s dangerous formula crisis and help get formula into the hands of parents.
RepWalorski,To the brave men and women who have answered the call to serve our nation THANK YOU! Our grateful nation is indebted to you. 
RepWalorski,As inflation continues to skyrocket more seniors are heading back to work to make ends meet. My Senior Citizens’ Freedom to Work Act would end the burdensome penalty on seniors who keep working or return to work after claiming Social Security benefits. 
RepWalorski,On day one President Biden canceled the Keystone Pipeline and began his all-out war on American-made energy. While Hoosiers face record-high fuel prices the Democrats want delusional Green New Deal pipe dreams instead of pipelines that would cut costs for families &amp; workers.
RepWalorski,Relieved to hear reports that the Biden Admin is giving up on its Disinformation Governance Board after we sounded the alarm. I helped introduce legislation that would prevent any taxpayer support for this or similar efforts that would endanger Americans' First Amendment rights.
RepWalorski,Every day I am hearing from Hoosier moms who are struggling to find the formula her child needs. I will continue calling on President Biden and his team to get serious about overcoming obstacles that prevent formula from reaching parents. The Biden Blame Game is unacceptable.
