SenShelby,The news of the violent loss of 15 innocent lives in Uvalde Texas is devastating and unimaginable. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims the children the school and the local law enforcement and officials.
SenShelby,Recent aggressive actions by Mexico's President &amp; Mexican officials threaten centuries-long economic cooperation &amp; diplomatic ties between the US &amp; Mexico. Their mistreatment of American companies operating in Mexico such as Vulcan Materials is wrong. President Biden must act. 
SenShelby,Alabama today is an important day in our state – primary election day! I urge you to head to the polls to exercise your right to vote. This election is up to the people of #Alabama. Don’t forget to cast your ballot today.
SenShelby,I joined 19 of my @SenateGOP colleagues in urging the Secretary of @CommerceGov to stop delaying permits for existing oil and gas leases. These delays are costly and unnecessary. We should be doing everything we can to lower gas prices and ramp up our energy independence.
SenShelby,I enjoyed meeting with @North_Alabama President @Ken_Kitts and others from the University yesterday afternoon. It was great to hear about UNA’s growing enrollment and the many ways they ready their students to be an integral part of Alabama's workforce. Go Lions!
