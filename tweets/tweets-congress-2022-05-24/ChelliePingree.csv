ChelliePingree,No school parent or community should experience this kind of horrific grief or live in fear of a gun massacre. I am heartbroken for those lost and sickened that no place is safe from gun violence in America. 
ChelliePingree,An America without Roe is an America without freedom. 
ChelliePingree,Overturning Roe will not stop abortions. It will stop  *safe* abortion care. Listen to my constituent Nuna‚Äôs harrowing story of surviving rape in a country without reproductive freedom and why she is so fearful of losing bodily autonomy in America too. #ProtectAbortion 
ChelliePingree,Who else is excited to get out on the new trail? üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
ChelliePingree,Now *this* is how to celebrate #NationalBikeToWorkDay!üö≤Today I presented the Eastern Trail Alliance with $700000 to expand the trail 11 miles from Kennebunk to North Berwick. As a senior member of @AppropsDems I proudly fought to bring this money home to Maine! 
ChelliePingree,Parents feel left behind FDA. When will you authorize COVID vaccines for children under 5? 
ChelliePingree,Horrifying. When given the chance to stop abortion bans like this every Republican in Congress voted against our reproductive freedom. 
ChelliePingree,JUST PASSED ‚úÖ by @HouseDemocrats (+ only 12 Republicans): $28 million to help restock shelves with safe baby formula ASAP. 
ChelliePingree,As @MainePublic reported last month this @CommerceGov investigation has stalled Maine‚Äôs solar energy boom.@POTUS this investigation must be resolved quickly so that our state can continue to make progress towards net-zero emissions. #MaineWontWait  
ChelliePingree,Pregnant + postpartum women facing mental health challenges can now call or text 1-833-9-HELP4MOMS to connect with a counselor toll-free. I proudly fought for this hotline‚Äôs funding through my role on @AppropsDems because mothers need support both in + out of health care settings 
ChelliePingree,Goooooooal indeed! ‚öΩÔ∏è ‚öΩÔ∏è ‚öΩÔ∏è #Solidarity 
ChelliePingree,Read our letter ‚¨áÔ∏è
ChelliePingree,.@POTUSParents in Maine and across the US are struggling to feed their children. We urge your Administration to continue around the clock efforts to get formula back on shelves.- Me &amp; 150 @HouseDemocrats
