JanSchakowsky,Enough is enough! The GOP must stand up to the gun lobby and get this done.
JanSchakowsky,No parent should have to worry about whether or not their child will come home from school. No one should feel unsafe running to the store for groceries. No one should fear riding public transportation. No one should be scared going to their place of worship.
JanSchakowsky,Gun violence is a choice. A choice that Republican lawmakers have made time and time again by refusing to pass common sense legislation. They have for at least the second time in 10 days let their constituents and fellow Americans down. 
JanSchakowsky,The #SocialSecurity2100 Act will make a real difference for people in my district &amp; across the country. As Co-Chair of the @HouseDemocrats Task Force on Aging &amp; Families I am proud to co-lead this letter &amp; to urge that we bring this bill to the Floor. 
JanSchakowsky,Black women are three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than white women. It‚Äôs past time we address the disparities in our health care system. We must pass @RepUnderwood‚Äôs Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021. #BlackLivesMatter¬†
JanSchakowsky,The bipartisan PRICED Act will limit the monopoly power of Big Pharma and will enable small manufacturers to enter the market saving the federal government at least $7B over 10 years according to estimates from @HHS. #FairDrugPricing
JanSchakowsky,The cost of inaction is high. In 2017 ALL of the top 10 highest-expenditure drugs in Medicare Part B were biologic products. Biologics can be expensive even with private insurance with some treatments costing tens of thousands of dollars per year.
JanSchakowsky,Extended exclusivity allows Big Pharma to prevent competition and pad their pockets. The #PRICEDAct will end special protections for biologics a class of bio-based drugs by reducing their exclusivity from 12 years to 5 years.
JanSchakowsky,Today I reintroduced the #PRICEDAct with my colleague @RepWesterman to rein in Big Pharma and help lower the costs of certain prescription drugs. #FairDrugPricing 
JanSchakowsky,Thank you @POTUS for taking these additional measures! We will continue working around the clock to get formula back on the shelves to #FeedOurInfants. No parent or caregiver should have to fear being unable to feed their child. 
JanSchakowsky,Last night I voted for an emergency spending package to address the baby formula shortage - a key step to help #FeedOurInfants. Our work is not done. We will continue to investigate how this happened and hold responsible parties accountable to ensure this never happens again.
JanSchakowsky,Going to the grocery store &amp; seeing empty shelves with no infant formula in sight is distressing for any parent.Today @HouseDemocrats &amp; I are voting for a bill that will help #FeedOurInfants by providing the FDA with the resources it needs to address this shortage. 
JanSchakowsky,27 years ago #HeadStart was expanded to address the needs of income-eligible pregnant women andchildren prenatal-to-three through #EarlyHeadStart. Join me in celebrating the nationwide impact ofboth programs! #57YearsOfHeadStart #HappyBDayHeadStart

JanSchakowsky,The reauthorization of #WIOA will expand access to high-quality job training career navigation services and other critical services to help our nation‚Äôs workers find more sustainable and better paying jobs.
JanSchakowsky,Yesterday I was proud to help pass the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2022 out of the House! This critical legislation is a recommitment to our nation‚Äôs workers. After 10 years it is time for us to fully fund our workforce programs!
JanSchakowsky,üëèüëèüëè 
JanSchakowsky,I had the opportunity today to attend the Joint Session of Congress where we heard from the Prime Minister of Greece Kyriakos Mitsotakis @kmitsotakis. And then we took a selfie.
