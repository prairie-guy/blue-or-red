RepKimSchrier,My heart is breaking for the students teachers and families in Uvalde reeling from another horrific school shooting this time at an elementary school. It is tragic that this has happened and that parents in this country have to wonder whether our children are safe at school. 
RepKimSchrier,Last call! From now until Thursday my office is collecting info and photos of fallen servicemembers to display on a virtual wall of portraits. None of our fallen heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice should be forgotten. More details here:  
RepKimSchrier,This weekend I joined Alex Witt to talk about the baby formula shortage and what I hope to hear in our @EnergyCommerce Oversight Subcommittee hearing this week the monkeypox outbreak and the newly approved boosters for kids ages 5-11. Watch below! 
RepKimSchrier,This week the House passed two bills that will help to address the baby formula shortage including expanding access to more brands for families on WIC. This week I will participating in an oversight hearing with FDA and Abbott to find out what happened. 
RepKimSchrier,My telephone town hall is coming up! It will be this Thursday May 26th @ 5:00 p.m. PT. To make sure you get a call sign up here:  
RepKimSchrier,This weekend I joined CNN Newsroom to speak about the ongoing baby formula shortage and what I hope to hear in our #SubOversight hearing this week. We also talked about my gas price gouging prevention bill that passed the House this week. Watch below! 
RepKimSchrier,ICYMI: On Thursday the House passed my bill that will empower the Federal Trade Commission to go after oil and gas price gougers.  People in my district &amp; across the country are feeling the pain of high prices at the pump. Something needs to be done. 
RepKimSchrier,This Armed Forces Day we celebrate all who serve in uniform with honor.I am so grateful to service members and their families for the sacrifices they make for our country. 
RepKimSchrier,Earlier this month I had the pleasure of meeting agricultural leaders in Snohomish County with my colleague @RepDelBene. As the only member from the PNW on the House Ag Committee I will continue to do all I can to support farmers and growers in Washington state. 
RepKimSchrier,The House just passed the bill I introduced w/ @RepKatiePorter to go after price gouging by gas &amp; oil companies. At a time when people in my district &amp; across the country are feeling the pain of high prices at the pump Congress needs to be doing all we can to bring down costs. 
RepKimSchrier,We cannot allow Big Oil to continue to rip off the American people. The Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act will empower the Federal Trade Commission to go after oil and gas price gougers. It is time for Congress to step in do our job and help protect American consumers.
RepKimSchrier,I’ve been pushing for the President to invoke the DPA so I’m glad to finally see this action today. This is one important way to address the infant formula shortage and get formula back on shelves faster. Next week I’ll be looking into what happened in an oversight hearing. 
RepKimSchrier,Today I joined @JDBalartMSNBC to talk about the ongoing baby shortage formula. No parent should have to worry about being able to feed their newborn. There are steps we can take now to get formula back on shelves. This was preventable. We must prevent it from happening again. 
RepKimSchrier,Several of my bills will be debated during today's markup including a bill that will help children access mental health care. Tune in here:
