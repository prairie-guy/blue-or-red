SenMarkKelly,There are commonsense reforms we can pass to reduce gun violence that align with our rights and are supported across the political spectrum. After witnessing yet another tragedy Arizonans are right to expect action from Washington. They should demand it. I know I will.
SenMarkKelly,Politicians in Washington spend countless hours fighting about nothing but when it comes time to act on an issue that is unique to the United States and demands a response they find a million reasons not to.
SenMarkKelly,It infuriates me that Americans have come to expect that their federal government will once again react to the murder of schoolchildren by doing nothing.
SenMarkKelly,Gabby and I are heartbroken for the Texas families who just had their lives forever devastated by gun violence. I know how helpless a person can feel when their family is impacted in this way. I know that every parent whose kid came home from school today is hugging them tighter.
SenMarkKelly,I support the bipartisan #SAFEBankingAct. It's time the federal government stopped forcing Arizona’s cannabis businesses to operate as cash only and gave access to basic financial services. This is a common sense pro-business effort that would improve safety and livelihoods.
SenMarkKelly,I've been pushing manufacturers and the administration to act urgently to increase the supply of baby formula. Any families needing help right now finding baby formula should visit 
SenMarkKelly,We need to close the digital divide once and for all. 
SenMarkKelly,Thousands of new great-paying jobs. Stronger supply chains. Lower costs for working families. My plan to boost domestic microchip manufacturing is a huge win for Arizona.
SenMarkKelly,Members of Congress should NOT be allowed to trade individual stocks. Plain and simple.
SenMarkKelly,Congratulations to the five impressive Arizonans who were selected as Presidential Scholars. Isaac H. Kan Salil Naik Lydia Marie Pastore Katelyn Sarah Cai and Ayva Francesca Kacir have bright futures ahead of them. 
SenMarkKelly,This #AAPIHeritageMonth is a time to condemn anti-Asian hate and stand with our diverse Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. Let's celebrate all of the important ways AAPI Arizonans contribute to this state and nation.
SenMarkKelly,Our bipartisan resolution to commemorate #NationalPoliceWeek was adopted by the Senate. Police put themselves in harm's way every single day to keep our communities safe. We'll never forget the 21 brave Arizona law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty last year.
SenMarkKelly,I met last week with the newly-elected White Mountain Apache Chairman Kasey Velasquez. Looking forward to working with him and his team on important priorities like tribal water access. 
SenMarkKelly,Thank you to the brave Americans who serve in our nation's military. Today we honor them on #ArmedForcesDay for their service and sacrifice.
SenMarkKelly,I’m down at the Yuma border today where I met with local Yuma leaders @CBP Border Patrol and @ICEgov leadership.Arizonans deserve a secure orderly and humane border response and I will continue to hold the administration accountable to that. 
SenMarkKelly,Today’s decision doesn't change the fact that there’s a crisis at the border and there must be a detailed plan that can be implemented before Title 42 is lifted.For too long Arizonans have paid the price for Washington’s failure to secure the border.
SenMarkKelly,Our wildland firefighters have a very difficult job and put themselves at great risk to do it. They’ve already done incredible work battling the first blazes of the year. I’m working to get them better pay and stronger benefits.
SenMarkKelly,As Chair of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee I recently led a hearing that focused on @USSOCOM’s ability to sustain counterterrorism while accelerating efforts to better compete with adversaries like China and Russia. 
SenMarkKelly,This week I met with Ukrainian Arizonans to hear their concerns about the ongoing war and Russian war crimes. The military and humanitarian assistance we just passed in the Senate will help the people of Ukraine continue to defend against Putin’s illegal invasion. 
SenMarkKelly,The #AmericanRescuePlan is helping to build more affordable housing in Maricopa County. Good things can happen when we listen to the priorities of local governments.
SenMarkKelly,Thank you @MayorCCarlat for stopping by my office to talk about microchips and the economic boost coming to Peoria as a result of TSMC's new facility. I'm eager to work together to pass my domestic microchip manufacturing plan and bring even more good paying jobs to Arizona. 
SenMarkKelly,Corporate PACs. Let's ban 'em.
SenMarkKelly,Exciting things are happening in Winslow!
