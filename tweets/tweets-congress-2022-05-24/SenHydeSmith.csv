SenHydeSmith,As our nation prepares for its #MemorialDay ceremonies to honor our fallen I applaud the hospitality shown by Mississippians as @RunForTheWall rolled through our state to reach national services in D.C. this weekend. 
SenHydeSmith,New extreme @WHO guidelines aim to remove all safeguards on abortion impose restrictions on the conscience rights of health workers and ignore the #righttolife. We wrote to implore @DrTedros to reverse course and retract these dangerous guidelines. Read the letter:
SenHydeSmith,Our nation faces the unfortunate reality that it has a shortfall of palliative &amp; hospice caregivers which increases the burdens that come w/ life-threatening illnesses. Palliative Care &amp; Hospice Education &amp; Training Act recommends proactive steps to help correct this imbalance.
SenHydeSmith,"""May the Lord direct your hearts into God’s love and Christ’s perseverance."" 2 Thessalonians 3:5"
SenHydeSmith,May is #MilitaryAppreciationMonth a month designated to show extra gratitude to our nation’s servicemembers &amp; veterans who have selflessly served our homeland to protect all that we hold dear. We must also think of their loved ones who solidly stand by their side in support. 
SenHydeSmith,The radical left chips away at women’s rights each time they disregard biological differences between males &amp; females. Our resolution reaffirms those unique differences &amp; seeks to protect women’s rights whether it's in athletics prisons or domestic violence shelters. @RepDLesko
SenHydeSmith,Happy my staff participated in the groundbreaking for the new Milwaukee Tool facility in Grenada! This new addition is exciting for the @cityofgrenada and the surrounding area and the benefits will be felt for many years to come. 
SenHydeSmith,Gulf of Mexico oil &amp; gas production has proven to be clean reliable &amp; affordable. Despite these benefits offshore production down since Jan 2021 &amp; outlook for new lease sales (required by law) looks iffy. I asked @SecDebHaaland what @Interior has against U.S. energy. More:
SenHydeSmith,The @whitehouse should have seen the baby formula shortage coming last year and as soon as Abbott shut down. Instead we’re now faced with another crisis complicated by supply chain challenges product recalls and record inflation. We wrote to @US_FDA demanding answers.
SenHydeSmith,.@POTUS &amp; Democrats need to take this #energycrisis seriously and stop finding every excuse in the book to shrink U.S. production. Until this happens every family &amp; business in Mississippi &amp; around this country will continue to pay the price of Biden’s failed energy policies.
SenHydeSmith,Addressed my continued concerns with @EPAMichaelRegan about getting the Yazoo Backwater Pumps back on track. It can happen if @EPA follows the facts &amp; the science. The Mississippi Delta needs a quick resolution that benefits people communities &amp; the environment. #FinishThePumps
SenHydeSmith,Happy 57th birthday to @NatlHeadStart! #HeadStart is essential in supporting early childhood development and education. Thank you for your many years of service to families and their communities. Learn more:
