RepLeeZeldin,"Our southern border is being flooded with unprecedented levels of illegal immigration &amp; fentanyl. Firing border patrol officers over their COVID vax status has to be one of the dumbest ideas to come out of the Biden Admin, and that’s saying something! https://t.co/rIP0HD4OS9"
RepLeeZeldin,"78 years ago today, our nation's Greatest Generation courageously stormed the beaches of Normandy. Thousands perished making the ultimate sacrifice on #DDay. We can never repay them, but we can and must ensure their legend, legacy and purpose forever live on. https://t.co/ITibxY7OUb"
RepLeeZeldin,"NYers are feeling less &amp; less safe in NY. The list is LONG as to why, including cashless bail, Less is More, DAs not enforcing the law, attacks on qualified immunity, &amp; other policies handcuffing justice instead of criminals. Just discussed with @kilmeade on @foxandfriends. https://t.co/N4uQ4Stu42"
RepLeeZeldin,"Everyone responding with “well regulated”, “militia”, or “well regulated militia” should read Federalist 29. https://t.co/Tc2tDyoiaC"
RepLeeZeldin,"Every last COVID mandate should be gone! There are NYers fired &amp; still out of the job they love bc they didn’t get the COVID shot, toddlers still forced to be masked up all day, &amp; parents unable to attend their kid’s graduation. It all needs to end immediately."
RepLeeZeldin,"The price of gas has DOUBLED to record highs since Joe Biden took office. The far-left really needs to kick rocks with their very extreme Green New Deal agenda. It's time to remove burdensome regulations, unleash domestic energy production and renew American energy independence!"
RepLeeZeldin,New York’s SAFE Act is unconstitutional and must be REPEALED!
RepLeeZeldin,"Canceling billions in student debt is an insane policy &amp; a slap in the face to all who sacrificed to pay off student loans, work their way through college or skip college entirely. @POTUS needs to be a leader &amp; tell socialists they're 100% wrong. @FoxBusiness @DavidAsmanfox https://t.co/hBTTdEejni"
RepLeeZeldin,Shall Not Be Infringed!
RepLeeZeldin,"Unleash American energy independence
Lower taxes
Remove unnecessary regulations
Rein in out of control spending
 
The issue isn’t that nothing can be done. It’s that the Biden Admin has no plan, no will and no conviction to ease this crushing burden on American families! https://t.co/ux0WIV7CR2"
RepLeeZeldin,"While the Biden Admin is stuck in the spin zone, the rest of America is refusing to fall for it, because they feel the pain for themselves at the pump, at the supermarket, and way beyond. Discussed with @seanspicer and @LyndsayMKeith last night on @newsmax. https://t.co/CzTbkHYI6S"
RepLeeZeldin,"If you want to wear a mask, wear a mask. Wear 10 masks if it makes you happy. If you don’t want to wear a mask, don’t wear a mask. The Biden Admin needs to dial the power trip way back. https://t.co/Rax6hx2D4B"
RepLeeZeldin,Ramp up domestic energy production and make the U.S. energy independent again! https://t.co/VtccwcyPwP
RepLeeZeldin,John Hinckley's debt to society is not yet repaid after shooting and nearly killing the President of the United States 41 years ago. He should spend the rest of his life behind bars. Full stop!
