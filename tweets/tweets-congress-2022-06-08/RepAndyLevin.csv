https://t.co/6xux42kFia"
RepAndyLevin,This @washingtonpost analysis confirms what we already knew: US support enabled the Saudi-led coalition to commit war crimes. We are overdue for accountability for these strikes and a reckoning on how the US enables partners to commit human rights abuses. https://t.co/POpVHRx8L4
RepAndyLevin,"Last year, humans pumped 36 billion tons of the greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, more than any other year in history. We need urgently the #GreenNewDeal.

RepAndyLevin,"Since passage, I‚Äôve received many questions about implementation of the new opportunity to unionize in offices across the House, &amp; also heard &amp; read many misconceptions about what Congressional unionization might accomplish, how it might work &amp; what the ramifications might be.üßµ"

RepAndyLevin,"As a longtime reproductive justice advocate, I am ready to fight for the right of every American who needs one to access an abortion. We must proclaim that abortion rights are human rights. #BansOffOurBodies"
RepAndyLevin,.@POTUS should NOT meet w/ MBS. MBS approved journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder‚Äîaccording to his own admin! MBS is responsible for human rights violations at home &amp; abroad. This sends a terrible signal to the global community &amp; undermines US credibility¬†https://t.co/Z3Bva7Uggx

RepAndyLevin,"I‚Äôm pleased to hear that @POTUS has forgave the debt of 31,850 Michiganders who were defrauded by Corinthian Colleges, Inc. Now, he must go broader and deliver for the 43.4 million Americans counting on him to #CancelStudentDebt."
