RepAndyBiggsAZ,"I will not be physically attending the first panel of the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s hearing on gun violence today. 

I object strongly to the Democrats’ exploitation of children who have been victimized so recently in Uvalde. https://t.co/BBGPMLXgVC"
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"The Biden Administration could terminate about 4,000 Border Patrol Agents because they’re unvaccinated. 

This would be a grave mistake. 

With hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens pouring across the border every month, we can’t afford to lose these courageous agents."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"This is outrageous. Perhaps an all-time worst comment by a Biden Press Sec. 

We have historic inflation, historic gas prices, falling wages, weak job growth, and an impending recession.

Americans deserve better than the Biden regime.

RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Letter below:

RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Today, I sent a letter along with @RepGosar and @RepDavid to the VA Secretary regarding mental health and primary care shortages in the greater Phoenix area. 

Our nation has promised care for our veterans and the VA is failing to deliver that promise."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,President Joe Biden is the worst president in American history.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"The illegitimate Jan. 6 hearing this week is a distraction from the Biden Admin’s colossal domestic and international failures. 

Americans are troubled by Biden’s record inflation, high gas prices, major crime in cities, and a porous southern border. 

The priorities are wrong. https://t.co/a9vZAIxci9"
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"15K migrants are headed to our southern border right now. 

Biden is doing absolutely nothing to stop this invasion. https://t.co/e7d8z0KW29"
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Biden and the Left support arming Ukrainians to defend themselves, but don’t support arming Americans to defend themselves. 

It makes no sense."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"In some states, the price of a gallon of gas has surpassed the federal minimum wage. 

This is unacceptable. 

We must release American energy. 

Now."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Honored to see Gilbert make the Top 20. 

I work very hard to ensure that my district is safe, affordable, and has premier education opportunities.

RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Today, we honor and remember the legacy of brave U.S. soldiers who fought for freedom and democracy on the beaches of Normandy. 

They exemplified the ultimate example of courage and we are forever indebted to them."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Democrats have repeatedly said that the 2017 Trump tax cuts cost Americans “2 trillion.”

This couldn’t be more false. 

According to the latest CBO data, these cuts will bring in additional $570 billion in revenue–even after adjusting for Biden’s inflation."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"The Biden Admin and congressional Democrats want to disarm millions of law-abiding Americans. 

According to them, Americans shouldn’t even have handguns. 

I won’t let that happen. https://t.co/gvmnLYT9W1"
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Biden’s inflation is causing the cost of building materials and supplies to sky rocket. 

Prices for essential materials such as iron, steel, and softwood lumber are up by 70 percent since the start of the pandemic.

We need to upgrade our infrastructure, and this is not helping."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"The Radical Left wants to disarm Americans. 

But in reality, that makes us less safe. https://t.co/mVvfrFYg2H"
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"The French queen is known for her insensitivity and uncaring responses to  her people. 

The same can be said today about leaders within the Biden Admin and Nancy Pelosi. 

https://t.co/DtypzUN7SQ"
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Trump advisor Peter Navarro gets arrested while Clinton attorney Michael Sussman gets acquitted in the same week. 

Justice is gone under the Biden Admin."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"The Biden Admin has spent $72 million in taxpayer money to avoid building our southern border wall. 

When I go to the border, pallets of materials sit there unused. 

It’s clear that this Admin does not care about securing our border."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,Courageous law enforcement individuals like Mr. Lopez make Arizonans safer and I will always have their backs. May Mr. Lopez Rest in Peace.
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"My deepest sympathies go out to the friends, family, and community of White Mountain Apache Police Officer Adrian Lopez who had his life taken away by a rogue individual."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"The World Health Organization has been compromised by China and has sabotaged many public health investigations - including the COVID investigation in Wuhan.

It’s time America gets out of it.

RepAndyBiggsAZ,"THREAD: 

My WHO Withdrawal Act is necessary more than ever. 

The World Health Organization has undermined American interests, remains one of the most corrupt international institutions, and has been compromised by China."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"For years, the WHO has undermined American interests and remains one of the most corrupt and ineffective international institutions.

RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Today, I introduced the WHO Withdrawal Act. 

It requires the President to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO), repeals the law that originally authorized the U.S. to join the WHO, and prevents taxpayer money from being spent to participate in it."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Biden is apparently looking to visit Saudi Arabia to discuss our oil and gas crisis with regional leaders in the Middle East.

Instead of meeting with foreign regimes thousands of miles away, Joe ought to be having these talks with American oil and gas producers here at home."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Let us remember Joe Biden once said: 

“I am convinced that a criminal who wants a firearm can get one through illegal, untraceable, unregistered sources, with or without gun control.”

This still applies today!"
RepAndyBiggsAZ,This is outrageous. This mindset has no place in America. https://t.co/4xqdLS2pwY
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Democrats are pushing ineffective gun control policies that take Second Amendment rights away from law-abiding Americans.

We are not safer because of gun control laws. In fact, we are more at risk. 

Look at cities with strict gun laws (NYC, CHI, Baltimore).

They’re all unsafe."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Biden is saying he had not been aware of the baby formula shortage until April.

The Biden Admin waited almost two months before taking actions to address the shortage. 

The Biden Admin is airlifting baby formula from other countries into our own. 

This Admin is a disaster."

RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Larry, a Vietnam veteran who arrived in the Army, came to us seeking his discharge DD214 papers to apply for general benefits.

RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Our nation’s rise in everyday prices is not “transitory” nor is it “Putin’s Price Hike.”

The rise is directly attributed to the unacceptable spending habits from the Biden Administration and Congressional Democrats."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"Reckless spending by the Biden Administration and Congressional Democrats has resulted in historic inflation and an economy headed towards a recession. 

These folks should know money doesn’t grow on trees."
RepAndyBiggsAZ,"The Biden Admin still requires American citizens to take a COVID test before they enter the country. 

Yet, no such requirement exists for illegal aliens coming across our southern border. 

Their guidance doesn’t make sense and it never did."
