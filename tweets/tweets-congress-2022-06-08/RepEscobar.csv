RepEscobar,"The 45k flowers at the Washington Monument representing lives lost to gun violence in 2021 remind us that the stakes are too high not to enact meaningful gun safety legislation.

I'm proud to have joined¬†@GiffordsCourage,¬†@HouseDemocrats, and¬†@SenateDems¬†to say: enough is enough. https://t.co/UhAoKMw2Z0"
RepEscobar,"I'm honored to join such passionate advocates for gun safety reform during today's @GiffordsCourage ceremony.

Too many have suffered from gun violence. Americans are counting on us to act. We're just hoping Republicans will listen.

RepEscobar,".@JohnCornyn, as senator for Texas, you know 23 innocent lives were taken at a Walmart in El Paso, dozens seriously wounded and our community was deeply traumatized.

It‚Äôs not just schools. 

It‚Äôs the guns.

This is a real opportunity for serious reform. Don‚Äôt give us a fig leaf. https://t.co/Q3q5D57bgV"
RepEscobar,"Thank you,¬†@donwinslow.

Gun safety legislation is common-sense, wildly popular, and long overdue. Texas has tried to solve the gun violence epidemic with more guns; yet we have more mass shootings than any other state in the country.

Their way doesn't work, ours saves lives. https://t.co/hLC7CNiJ3t"
RepEscobar,"My bill, the Military Spouse Entrepreneur Reimbursement Act, helps military spouses with the costs of moving their businesses when they receive a permanent change of station order.

I'm excited to propose a solution for those that have sacrificed so much already. https://t.co/b8yya8XcbB"
RepEscobar,"June 6 marks the anniversary of D-Day, when Allied forces landed on beaches across Normandy, France to continue the liberation of Europe from the Nazis.

Let us remember the U.S. and other Allied servicemembers who fought for freedom against tyranny that day.

RepEscobar,"""I don't know anyone who's been a more vocal and passionate advocate for @FortBlissTexas"" -@RepDWStweets.

I recently presented my funding requests for the VA Health Center and Ft. Bliss during an @AppropsDems subcommittee hearing to modernize our military and veteran facilities. https://t.co/6V3DA6z0XZ"
RepEscobar,"It‚Äôs been wonderful to spend the past two weeks in El Paso!

Watch to learn more about how I spent my time at home working on your behalf, including several visits to our Community Project Funding request sites!üëáüèΩ https://t.co/QfXXB5offz"
RepEscobar,"Good morning!‚òÄÔ∏è

I‚Äôll be joining @jaketapper on @CNNSotu in just a few minutes. We‚Äôll be discussing gun safety reform, including @HouseJudiciary‚Äôs markup of the Protecting Our Kids Act.

See you soon! üëãüèº https://t.co/axr5Yf5KAC"
RepEscobar,"Javier Amir Rodriguez should be graduating from Horizon High School in El Paso tonight. But his life was tragically taken on August 3, 2019 while at Walmart by a domestic terrorist armed with an AK-47 who was fueled by hate and racism.

Thank you @ClintISD for honoring his life. https://t.co/L1lDRrkYcc"
RepEscobar,"Adding renewable energy systems is always a no brainer for me.

Glad I joined @flyelp this week to discuss one of the community project funding requests for a Solar Covered Parking Lot. https://t.co/nB0eb4OhP0"
RepEscobar,These policies will curb gun violence and save lives. It's time to put thoughts and prayers aside and get to work.
RepEscobar,"Santa Fe | Child Access Prevention

The 17-year-old Santa Fe shooter used his father's guns. Child access prevention laws allow negligent adults to be held responsible when their guns are used by minors in their care to harm others. He murdered 10 people and wounded 13."
RepEscobar,"El Paso | Red Flag Laws

The El Paso shooter had a family member reach out to law enforcement about concerns over the shooter's weapon possession in the weeks before the shooting. Red flag laws allow family, friends, and officials to file formal concerns. He murdered 23."
RepEscobar,"Midland-Odessa | Restricting Private Firearm Sales

The Midland-Odessa shooter failed a background check due to mental health concerns. In 2019, he bought an AR-15 through a private sale that legally circumvented background checks entirely. He murdered 7 and injured 25."
RepEscobar,"Uvalde | Raising the Age Requirement

The Uvalde shooter waited until days after his 18th birthday to legally purchase a weapon of war. Raising the age so young adults can't buy a gun before they can buy their first legal drink shouldn't be controversial. He murdered 21 people."
RepEscobar,"Since 2018, there have been 4 mass shootings in Texas that resulted in the deaths or injury of 20+ individuals. Here's how gun safety provisions from H.R. 7910, the Protecting Our Kids Act, which the @HouseJudiciary passed yesterday, could have impacted those horrific events.

üßµ"
RepEscobar,"As I said during our @HouseJudiciary hearing, Republicans in Congress think the answer to gun violence is more guns. Once we create schools that are more like prisons than places of learning, will we do that to shopping malls, hospitals, grocery stores as well?

It‚Äôs. The. Guns. https://t.co/EXrDagGY5z"
RepEscobar,"I‚Äôm also delighted to congratulate incoming General Manager, Brenda De Anda‚ÄìSwann. I look forward to seeing all she accomplishes in her new role."
RepEscobar,"It was a pleasure to join @abc7breaking for Kevin Lovell‚Äôs retirement festivities this week!

Kevin has been the General Manager of KVIA for 23 years and has contributed immensely to making ‚Äì and keeping ‚Äì El Paso‚Äôs journalism top tier. https://t.co/3hQU0dQvHm"
RepEscobar,"Every semester means a new class of bright and hard-working interns in my office. I recently had the opportunity to sit down and chat with the El Paso interns.

I look forward to the many great things you‚Äôll accomplish on behalf of El Pasoans! https://t.co/CdpYNqk9HO"
RepEscobar,"It was a pleasure to be the keynote speaker for Career Day at @YsletaISD's Rio Bravo Middle School last week.

I‚Äôm honored to share my experience representing El Paso and always appreciate the opportunity to encourage young people to pursue a career in public service. https://t.co/MhfgkLfJIw"
RepEscobar,"We‚Äôve thought and we‚Äôve prayed, it‚Äôs time to act.

Common-sense gun safety legislation isn‚Äôt controversial to the American people; it shouldn‚Äôt be controversial to my Republican colleagues. https://t.co/5l1nGCoL50"
RepEscobar,"After the El Paso shooting, my community demanded a special legislative session. We never got it. This time, little is different‚Äîlots of talk, no action.
¬†
@GregAbbott_TX is hoping we forget. He‚Äôs counting we won‚Äôt hold him accountable. I‚Äôm ready to prove him wrong, are you? https://t.co/ad1rUBu7ZD"
RepEscobar,"Sending my love to Uvalde and ready to work together to get common-sense gun safety legislation across the finish line.

#UvaldeUnited https://t.co/yRwpfx9qfy"
RepEscobar,"It was wonderful to meet with @DSayavedraEPISD to discuss the EPISD STEAM Learning Centers, one of my requests for the community project funding.

These centers will help maintain literacy, develop social emotional skills, and promote health and fitness within the district. https://t.co/7ajPBqLFWf"
RepEscobar,"The @TTUHSCEP Border Health Center would target at-risk communities, develop better partnerships, increase medical care for obesity, diabetes, and cancer, and improve care on the border.

That's why I'm proud to submit this as one of my 15 requests for community funding projects. https://t.co/0XBsESx5xi"
