RepBenCline,I was grateful to celebrate the life and work of retired Army Master Sergeant Silverine James at the dedication of the Salem VAMC Women’s Health Clinic in her honor. I was glad she was able to attend the monumental occasion. https://t.co/3AaTmG4zWm
RepBenCline,"As we commemorate the 78th Anniversary of #DDay, we pay tribute to the 4,000 Allied soldiers who gave their lives for the liberation of Europe and to rid the world of the Axis Powers. https://t.co/iHIAU7ZCHN"
RepBenCline,"At the border I heard from Border Patrol Agents on the massive volumes of drugs, such as Fentanyl, entering through the open border. This has a direct impact on Virginians as Fentanyl overdoses in our area are rising rapidly. https://t.co/dTE8nAus90"
RepBenCline,We are grateful to the State of Texas for giving us a tour of the Rio Grande and for putting in $2.5 million per week for border protection to make up for the lack of effective federal policy. https://t.co/fb5Y20TD3W
RepBenCline,"President Biden’s failed border policies have led to record numbers of illegals and unaccompanied minors crossing our southern border. We must finish the wall, reimplement ‘Remain in Mexico,’ end ‘Catch and Release,’ and keep Title 42. https://t.co/W3gyFC5H1O"
RepBenCline,"As drone footage shows, we found $350 million in unused border wall rusting in a pile in Texas. Another outrageous #BidenBorderBlunder. https://t.co/qUWWbEyl7C"
RepBenCline,"Biden’s failed immigration policies have created a humanitarian crisis at our border. Record numbers of unaccompanied minors are overwhelming our Border Patrol and our processing facilities like the one I visited today at Donna, Texas. https://t.co/SEJTOhCVJC"

RepBenCline,"This week, I’m seeing the #BidenBorderCrisis first-hand with @housebudgetGOP. We’re witnessing how ending border wall construction and Remain in Mexico, and reimplementing Catch and Release, have exacerbated this crisis, as well as how lifting Title 42 would overflow our border. https://t.co/wPbzSPtTkA"
