RepKatiePorter,"Congress has a duty to verify tax dollars are being spent wisely and as intended. As a member of @OversightDems, I'm committed to routing out waste, fraud, and abuse in government. I'm urging colleagues to invest in oversight, a key constitutional power that protects tax dollars. https://t.co/Hq7rjqjRDY"
RepKatiePorter,Child survivors of abuse and neglect rely on Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) and Guardians Ad Litem (GAL) to stand up for them in difficult times. I'm reintroducing my bipartisan resolution to honor these heroes by designating June 6th as CASA Volunteers’ Day.
RepKatiePorter,Corporations wouldn't be earning record profits if they were just raising prices to pass along costs. Wall Street is price gouging families—and making off with its fattest profit margins in 70+ years. https://t.co/sGPD1cF1Of

RepKatiePorter,"I'm grateful nonprofits like @outreachoc are helping Orange County families put food on the table, but these groups should be supplementing—not substituting—government action. Congress must help lower food costs by cracking down on monopolies price gouging at the grocery store. https://t.co/A6fDPGj2IS"
