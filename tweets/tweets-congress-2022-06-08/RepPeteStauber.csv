RepPeteStauber,"What an amazing story. Heroes come from every walk of life. With police officer recruitment and retention levels at an all time low, it leaves me very hopeful to see that there are still exceptional individuals ready to protect and serve. https://t.co/5aNEBWXrL5"
RepPeteStauber,"According to DHS, crossings of large groups in Texas are up 150% from the beginning of FY22, due to Biden’s attempt to end Title 42. The Biden Administration has shown they have NO intention of securing our border and enforcing federal law."
RepPeteStauber,Last week I met with @NFIB Small Businesses in North Branch to hear about what small business owners are struggling with so we can work towards solutions for our economic engines. https://t.co/PdA044ABEF
RepPeteStauber,"Today in MN, the average price per gallon of gas is $4.87. Gas prices jumped 35 cents in just one week. If we want to relieve Americans from Biden's Pain at the Pump, we need to increase domestic energy production."
RepPeteStauber,May we never forget the selflessness and bravery of the heroes who stormed the beaches of Normandy 78 years ago today to protect freedom in America and across the entire world. https://t.co/aNjiWoI6xn
RepPeteStauber,"Today @RepTiffany &amp; I held a tourism roundtable in Taylor Falls to hear from small business owners about their concerns regarding supply chains, gas prices, &amp; more.

RepPeteStauber,Jodi and I offer our deepest sympathy to Renee's family. Renee lived with a heart for service and passion for Duluth and our region. She will be missed greatly. https://t.co/mNRORSHTL3
RepPeteStauber,"Small businesses are the engine of our economy, and we should be promoting policies that enable them to thrive. Between the new red tape and skyrocketing costs, the Biden Administration has proven to be a disaster for small business owners. https://t.co/C0oS0oyrci"
RepPeteStauber,"Thank you to Pam Tomevi from Koochiching County, Sherriff Hedlund, the National Guard, &amp; other local leaders for showing us the impacts of this year's historic flooding in the Rainy River basin.

RepPeteStauber,"Yesterday I held a roundtable in Beaver Bay with cabin &amp; resort owners to hear firsthand accounts of how the northern border closure, inflation &amp; workforce shortages are crushing their businesses.

RepPeteStauber,"I’m grateful for the tour of @MEElecmetal's facility in Duluth. I had the chance to hear about their current struggles with energy costs, labor shortages, and how mining restrictions affect their business. https://t.co/94IB31EdPF"
