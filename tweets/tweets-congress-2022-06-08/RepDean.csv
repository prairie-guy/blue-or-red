When we think of #DDay and look at photos of those men approaching the shore, we are moved by the sheer magnitude of their bravery.

We will never forget their service and sacrifice for peace. https://t.co/FPFAGUaGNV"
RepDean,"The horrific gun violence in Philly has rocked our communities. I mourn for those killed, injured, and traumatized.

No dispute should end in a gun fight. No Saturday should end in carnage.

Congress will continue to work on concrete ways to reduce gun deaths. 

We must act."
