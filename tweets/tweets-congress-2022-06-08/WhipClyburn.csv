WhipClyburn,"This issue goes beyond race or geography.

12 states have refused to expand Medicaid under the ACA.  As a result, over 2 million adults lack access to quality, affordable health insurance.

Health care ought to be a human right, not a luxury. #CloseTheCoverageGap https://t.co/ozAFeykiCT"
WhipClyburn,"#ImmigrantHeritageMonth is an opportunity for us to come together and celebrate the immigrants that enrich our nation's history and culture.

This month we ought to remember that we are at our best when we are united."
WhipClyburn,"An overwhelming majority of Americans want stronger gun violence prevention legislation to protect their loved ones and their communities.

Will the @SenateGOP ever listen? Or will they continue to prioritize the wants of the gun lobby over the safety of our children? https://t.co/QiCooBGgp4"
WhipClyburn,"Honored to accept the @FordsTheatre Lincoln Medal from @PhyliciaRashad, awarded to those who exemplify President Lincoln's legacy.

This country doesn't need to be made great again—it already is.

Like Lincoln, I'm fighting to make that greatness accessible &amp; affordable to all. https://t.co/hlerozBpyj"
WhipClyburn,"As we recognize the 78th anniversary of #DDay today, I join my colleagues in paying tribute to all those who served and made the ultimate sacrifice so that we can enjoy the freedoms we have today. https://t.co/2hHApNoCyi"
WhipClyburn,"The American Rescue Plan put shots in arms, money in pockets &amp; people back to work.

The infrastructure bill invested billions in communities in need.

We ought to start looking at the glass half-full &amp; share the great things Dems have done to better Americans’ everyday lives. https://t.co/TEUbIyPFav"
WhipClyburn,"Today’s report showing 390,000 added jobs as more Americans enter the workforce is a positive sign that our economy is on the right path.

WhipClyburn,"Today, on National Gun Violence Awareness Day, Americans across the country are wearing orange to remember the lives lost to gun violence every year.

But, wearing orange is not enough. The Senate must join the House in passing common-sense legislation to protect our communities."
WhipClyburn,"Proud @HouseJudiciary is working to advance this comprehensive gun violence prevention package.

If nearly all R's continue to sit on their hands while children are dying, Americans will clearly see who's fighting to protect our kids—and who's fighting to leave them unprotected. https://t.co/PNs1Ol5j9R"
WhipClyburn,"It's not rational that an 18-year-old can't buy a beer in our society and yet we deem them mature enough to purchase a weapon of war.

We cannot allow this cycle of gun violence and trauma to continue.

Common-sense gun violence prevention legislation will save lives."
