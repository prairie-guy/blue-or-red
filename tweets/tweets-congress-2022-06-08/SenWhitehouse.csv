SenWhitehouse,Our Clean Competition Act will give clean American companies a step up in the global marketplace while lowering carbon emissions at home and abroad.
SenWhitehouse,"Good move. The climate crisis is at hand, and the United States needs to respond as we would to any disaster affecting our homes, jobs, and lives.

SenWhitehouse,"Live on the Senate Floor – how Rhode Island’s Gaspee Affair helped spark the American Revolution
 https://t.co/3Tkq8L4GOK"

SenWhitehouse,"Arrows keep pointing to Georgia: Trump’s pressure calls; plot from inside Trump DOJ; fake electors scheme.

SenWhitehouse,:-) https://t.co/ZzIay3ukBv
SenWhitehouse,"The dark channels of influence that have corrupted our politics for years were used to plan and execute the Jan. 6 coup attempt. 

The American people ought to know who the planners are and what they wanted — and we ought to help them find out."
SenWhitehouse,https://t.co/6X2GA7KF1v
SenWhitehouse,"We live this problem every day in Congress:  
“Almost all CEOs say they believe the science of climate change. But behind the scenes they’re blocking everything …. [via their] lobbying and unlimited political spending, which is what’s blocking meaningful climate legislation.”"
SenWhitehouse,"Hysterical, given Republican AGs funded by fossil fuel who are fossil fuel’s de facto agents; viz. Republican AG Pruitt sending out on his official letterhead a fossil fuel company letter virtually unedited.
https://t.co/QkpLYAtTsw"
SenWhitehouse,"Here’s a great remembrance of Walter.    Mark Patinkin captures him well.  
https://t.co/aWYOCcARZT"
SenWhitehouse,"International oil cartel prices soar, and Big Oil takes a Big Profits ride, on the same gasoline they sold two bucks cheaper not long ago. 
https://t.co/IXbvpeInRm"
SenWhitehouse,"In Congress, the fossil fuel armada of lies &amp; obstruction still operates full tilt; other companies talk big but send trade assocs. &amp; lobbyists to Congress who are silent or hostile on climate action; Republicans take fossil fuel $$$ and block anything serious. That’s the status."
SenWhitehouse,"For all the big talk and corporate BS re caring about climate change, it’s still getting worse not better.  We know how to solve this (carbon price/clean energy investments); we choose not to. Why?

SenWhitehouse,"How dark money hides the hands responsible for the attack on the United States Capitol on January 6.   
https://t.co/CY9ZqVaood"

SenWhitehouse,https://t.co/YCjfxobEPm
SenWhitehouse,"Funny how alike these two columns are, in separate papers on opposite coasts. It says a lot about where the Captured Court stands right now. Time to clean up the mess."
SenWhitehouse,"“Some of the court’s conservatives seem eager to assist polluting industries by undercutting the power of agencies to regulate in the public interest.”

Guess whose dark money put them on the Court?   
https://t.co/hjXdXarFEw"
SenWhitehouse,"This is a Supreme Court determined to knock down regulations, overturn precedent, and cater to Republicans’ dark money donors. Soon, WV v. EPA will give them a long-awaited chance to do even more damage. Watch closely."
SenWhitehouse,"Thank goodness for courts, where dark money and political influence don’t rule. 

(Which doesn’t mean law firms can’t aid and abet polluters by producing delay and burdensome costs, but at the end of the day there is a trial.)
https://t.co/S2G6XfDbMt"
SenWhitehouse,"Americans are demanding commonsense gun safety laws. The gun industry will fight like hell, but we still hold the power to act."
SenWhitehouse,"That could make a real difference in emissions, opening a pathway to climate safety."
SenWhitehouse,"We could get a climate package via reconciliation with most of the Finance tax credits, the EPW methane price, and a border adjustment; which we probably need to do before August recess.
https://t.co/n791nWY8D7"
SenWhitehouse,"Small wonder that the CIA interfered with our Intelligence Committee report, and has never reconciled itself with its torture program’s failure.  
https://t.co/mupjXExFO8"
SenWhitehouse,"Total Republican flim-flam on climate. Try measuring it for emissions reductions, guys. What a joke.
https://t.co/J45h37cdq7"
SenWhitehouse,Corporations are raising prices simply because they can. I’m fighting back – to keep Americans’ money in their pockets.
SenWhitehouse,"Popular Science goes to Quonset to watch EB’s master craftsmen build the most formidable vessels ever to sail the sea. Go, Rhody! 
https://t.co/cry64Xu6Wp"
SenWhitehouse,Americans are fed up with secret donors influencing our elections. Democrats are fighting to pass the DISCLOSE Act to get dark money out of politics – so Americans can feel confident that Congress works for them. https://t.co/QgXJc9wXRB
SenWhitehouse,"This proves the point that there’s no “energy independence” when the energy is oil. No way.
https://t.co/6O192jwBfl"
SenWhitehouse,"I am thrilled @RIDOTNews won its largest federal grant ever from the INFRA program I created, and that the funding will support major upgrades to Rte. 146, like the elimination of the dangerous Sayles Hill bottleneck. Driving Rte. 146 will soon be more pleasant and efficient. https://t.co/SRFCn73j3p"
SenWhitehouse,Still no explanation of how Exxon arrived at that projection. https://t.co/6scrj94TtT
SenWhitehouse,"Someone needs to tell Exxon, who told shareholders there would be zero electric heavy duty trucks and buses in the world by 2040.  (Seemed fishy, since RI had already ordered three electric buses, and China had thousands in use.)"
SenWhitehouse,"The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program has let down too many borrowers, including Peace Corps volunteers who deferred their payments while serving abroad. @SenJeffMerkley and I introduced a bill to fix that &amp; support our nation’s public servants."
SenWhitehouse,"We must pass the DISCLOSE Act to shine the light of transparency on dark-money power. Congress should work for the American people - not special interests.
https://t.co/3J5hhobTVs"
SenWhitehouse,"American companies are finding smart ways to reduce their carbon emissions. In fact, our manufacturers are 40% more carbon-efficient than the global average. Let’s reward them for that innovation through a carbon border adjustment."
SenWhitehouse,"Let’s break the cycle of market concentration &amp; regulatory capture by big corporations. 

Americans are sick of their greed."
SenWhitehouse,"The fossil fuel industry lies for a living, deliberately and purposefully, and they lie to steal from you your future for their present profits, and they lie to hide from you their culpability for the evil they have wrought."
SenWhitehouse,"Well, corporate analyst Deloitte says it’s a present value $43 trillion gain to address climate, and a $178 trillion loss if we fail to — a $220+ trillion dollar difference!  
https://t.co/Kc5hcS1fVh"
SenWhitehouse,"Remember fossil fuel’s lie that climate action has big costs? “Yes, we should do something about climate but not wreck the economy”?"
SenWhitehouse,"Never, ever."
SenWhitehouse,"All the fossil fuel lies in the world can’t change the fact that there CANNOT be “energy independence” with a commodity whose price is set by OPEC and international speculators, and a domestic industry that has hooked itself to that international price.

SenWhitehouse,"This week, I visited Beautiful Beginnings Child Care Center in Providence to meet with staff and understand the challenges they face as care providers. This is important work that strengthens communities and prepares children for success, so we need to be investing in it. https://t.co/AieK7vizZg"
SenWhitehouse,"For scale, humans first appeared in North America about 23,000 years ago.  
https://t.co/2htuFMfHQE"
SenWhitehouse,"#PrideMonth represents decades of advocacy, activism, and hard-won progress. Americans deserve to be themselves and live the lives they choose, and I will fight to defend that freedom by passing the Equality Act."
SenWhitehouse,"Excess profits could be $100 billion dollars, a bit of which will be plowed back into dark-money political spending for Republicans, rewarding them for their role in helping Big Oil gouge consumers."
SenWhitehouse,"They can do it in UK, under a conservative government; but today’s Republican Party is the political tool of the fossil fuel industry, so we meet “conservative” (read: fossil-fuel-funded) opposition. 
https://t.co/H7zoShvLy5"
SenWhitehouse,https://t.co/x2FrKO2yew
SenWhitehouse,The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program has landed many Americans in a bureaucratic nightmare with no relief in sight. @SenJeffMerkley and I just introduced a bill to build on the Biden administration’s fixes &amp; help more people work for the public good.
SenWhitehouse,"When wealthy donors call the shots, it’s no surprise that Republicans plan to raise taxes for millions of hard-working Americans while protecting corporate interests."
SenWhitehouse,".@EPA Brownfields funding from our bipartisan infrastructure law will put vacant, polluted lots back to productive use and breathe new life into neighborhoods in Woonsocket and across the state. https://t.co/WGtpFx2sqp"
SenWhitehouse,"The one through-line for Mitch is the political money.   It’s always about the political money, and the NRA is the conduit for masses of political money — $100 million in dark money alone.
https://t.co/CwJFgB67gI"
SenWhitehouse,But the fossil fuel propaganda machine charged forward anyway.
SenWhitehouse,"“In late March, AFP Fact Check, a global fact-checking organization, debunked the assertion that climate policies from the Biden administration somehow restrained oil and gas output, or undermined American energy security, calling it ‘misleading.’”
