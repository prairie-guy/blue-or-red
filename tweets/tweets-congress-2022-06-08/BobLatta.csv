BobLatta,".@POTUS is putting China ahead of US workers with this wrong-headed decision. Innovative solar mnfg in #OH05 is making the US more energy secure and supporting jobs. China skirts trade rules and uses forced labor, but they’re getting a pass from the WH. https://t.co/5nknhVJVJs"
BobLatta,"This chart spells it out, runaway spending by the current Admin has led to the highest inflation in 40 yrs.
