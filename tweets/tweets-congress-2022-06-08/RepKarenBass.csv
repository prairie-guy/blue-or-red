Thank you @SecFudge for coming to our city to continue talks with folks on the ground and to examine ways to leverage HUD resources to produce quality housing in our communities. https://t.co/QstCcUrbab"

RepKarenBass,"We have to be solution-oriented when it comes to this crisis.

I invited @SecFudge here to get a first-hand look at the homelessness crisis and to see what more we can do on the federal level to get people housed. https://t.co/dBjaQmcunN"

A church. 

An elementary school.

Now a hospital. 

All in the span of 3 weeks. How many people will die before the gun lobby and Republicans get out of our way and stop blocking our bills?
