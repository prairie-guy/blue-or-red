RepDonBeyer,"Extremely important. This is good news, American leadership and diplomacy is helping alleviate suffering and winning passage for humanitarian aid. Important that we continue to push for lasting peace in Ethiopia. https://t.co/D20SpyWe6U"
RepDonBeyer,"It was my distinct pleasure to welcome @VP and other Administration officials to Northern Virginia last month to announce a new program to promote electric school buses. The climate crisis is a huge challenge, and I am committed to doing all I can to meet this moment. https://t.co/JCcHNKJdQN"
RepDonBeyer,Thank you to the committed gun violence prevention advocates from @AMarch4OurLives who came to talk with me about gun safety reforms today! Looking forward to voting for lifesaving commonsense legislation this week. https://t.co/4sksKkUf7B
RepDonBeyer,"Jim Jordan could tell his side of the story at any time. He was invited to give sworn testimony to Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the Capitol.

He has so far refused, and chosen instead to conceal what he knows from investigators and the public. https://t.co/mcUsCQdQvi"
RepDonBeyer,"If you think Congress needs to take action to stem the flow of these weapons of war designed for the battlefield into American communities, I'm writing legislation to make this happen that could bypass Senate Republicans' filibuster. Here's how: https://t.co/m6KyxRD7Cw"
RepDonBeyer,"Across the country ""they use them to shoot"" human beings in schools, grocery stores, hospitals, churches, synagogues, malls, bars, and workplaces.

If you think shooting ""varmints"" is more important than preventing mass shootings of children at elementary schools, you're wrong. https://t.co/fsuoC1ZFae"
RepDonBeyer,This evening I walked the Bluemont Trail with residents and @ArlingtonVA leaders -- highlighting the Community Funding Project funding I secured for trail improvements. https://t.co/eKNucuSwO4
RepDonBeyer,"Congress must act to prevent mass shootings.

I’m writing a bill to restrict the flow of weapons of war into American communities - including AR-15’s and high capacity magazines - that could bypass the filibuster and pass with just 50 votes in the Senate:

RepDonBeyer,"Payrolls rose 390,000 in May, better than expected as companies keep hiring https://t.co/4PFbGDG5sN"
RepDonBeyer,"Great to see so many of you out in force in Arlington today to support gun violence prevention! Next week, we vote. #WearOrange https://t.co/Vp2ZmxqDD9"
RepDonBeyer,"Climate change is the major existential threat of our time, and every new data point makes the urgency to act clearer. I continue to push my colleagues to get as much as we can done to address the climate crisis ASAP. This summer is likely to be a crucial point in that struggle. https://t.co/rwCX3iQ6jG"
RepDonBeyer,"In case you missed it: President Biden explains his plan to address inflation and help Americans facing rising costs. A sharp contrast from Republicans, who have either proposed nothing at all or have suggested raising taxes on average people. https://t.co/qgLWW83XdV"
RepDonBeyer,"ICYMI: President Biden lays out America's goals and strategy for the current phase of the war to defend Ukraine from Russia's invasion.

RepDonBeyer,A beautiful Goldilocks jobs report? I've seen Stranger Things: https://t.co/IZTJAnu39N
RepDonBeyer,"The cruelty is the point.
The inhumanity is the point.

These attacks on trans youth are beyond the pale. https://t.co/K3IgZyUIg6"

RepDonBeyer,https://t.co/sCjg0AhkIw
RepDonBeyer,"The Protecting Our Kids Act was just advanced by the House Judiciary Committee yesterday, setting up votes on the House Floor next week. I strongly support this legislation to prevent gun violence; you can read more about it here: https://t.co/ZuMRZptxce"
RepDonBeyer,"This builds on other gun violence prevention work in the House. We already passed legislation to require a background check for every gun sale, which I voted for twice. Next week we vote on Extreme Risk Protection Order (""red flag law"") legislation I've championed for years."
RepDonBeyer,"The Protecting Our Kids Act also has sections to promote safe storage of guns, a key to responsible gun ownership that the gun debate has long overlooked.

And it would back regulatory actions at ATF to prohibit bump stocks and ghost guns with the force of legislative action."
RepDonBeyer,"The bill would establish new federal offenses and penalties for straw purchasing and gun trafficking. Many guns used in crimes in cities like Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. are purchased in places with weaker gun restrictions and then transported across state lines."
RepDonBeyer,"The bill would ban high capacity ammunition magazines. 

The man who killed six people and shot 18 others including Congresswoman Gabby Giffords in Tucson was tackled when he had to reload. Just before his 33-round magazine was emptied he shot a 9-year-old girl, killing her."
RepDonBeyer,"It would raise the age to purchase many semiautomatic rifles - including AR-15 models - from 18 to 21. 

I am a cosponsor of the Assault Weapons Ban, and support fully banning these weapons of war from civilian use, but raising the minimum purchase age would also save lives."
RepDonBeyer,"NEW: I signed on as a cosponsor of the Protecting Our Kids Act, broad gun violence prevention legislation introduced in the wake of horrific mass shootings in Uvalde, Buffalo, and elsewhere.

It's one of the most ambitious gun safety reforms in decades; here's what it would do–"
RepDonBeyer,"That’s not the “actual problem.”

Every country in the world has people with mental illness, but we are the only one that has these constant mass shootings.

It’s the guns. https://t.co/i83lRVbVmP"
RepDonBeyer,"Across America the AR-15 is the ""gun of choice"" for killing human beings in schools, hospitals, grocery stores, churches, synagogues, malls, theaters, bars, concert venues, and on and on. https://t.co/J71vm3sRt6"
RepDonBeyer,"The day after a mass shooting at a hospital in Tulsa, House Republicans brandish guns during a hearing on gun violence.

Families who lost loved ones are looking to their leaders for answers, and seeing juvenile stunts from extremists with no solutions. These people can't govern. https://t.co/BEibueRari"
RepDonBeyer,"Police now say the gunman who murdered two doctors, a receptionist, and a patient at a hospital in Tulsa yesterday bought the AR-15 he used just one hour before the shooting.

RepDonBeyer,"Here's a report from @JECDems contrasting the major economic benefits of green investments in a healthier future vs the catastrophic rising costs of inaction on climate: https://t.co/LcYp8XlUmH

Republicans' failed policies will lead to disaster. We owe our kids better than that."
RepDonBeyer,"The solution is blindingly obvious: clean energy. The more we are able to shift to clean energy, the better it will be for our health, and the less dependent we will be on fossil fuels, and the less susceptible our economy and American families will be to oil price swings."
RepDonBeyer,"Lining the pockets of fossil fuel companies is not a long term fix, it puts American families' health and the future of the planet at risk. The cost of climate-fueled extreme weather events in the most recent year for which we have data was $100 Billion. https://t.co/MzxOcQcsf2"
RepDonBeyer,I think most high school students in my district would be able to explain to you that this is not a way to fight climate change. It is a way to make it worse. https://t.co/VVEPpKqqmQ
RepDonBeyer,At a hospital in Tulsa. Just absolutely horrifying. https://t.co/EvFYAAE3DR
RepDonBeyer,Can't make it up: House Republicans' strategy to address climate change calls for more drilling. https://t.co/gZqx82ub8W
RepDonBeyer,"Pride Month celebrates decades of struggle for equality since Stonewall. This is a time to lift up that ongoing struggle and those devoted to it, to celebrate civil rights and the importance of protest, and to reject discrimination. Happy Pride Month! https://t.co/4thZMKtRl5"
