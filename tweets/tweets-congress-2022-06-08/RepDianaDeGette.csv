RepDianaDeGette,"BREAKING: Our legislation to ban high-capacity gun magazines just passed the Judiciary committee &amp; now heads to the full House for a vote.
 
Experts agree banning these magazines will help save lives. It’s one of the many things we need to do better protect our communities."
RepDianaDeGette,"We need to:

- Reinstate the nationwide ban on assault weapons
- Ban high-capacity magazines
- Strengthen our system of background checks

I have sponsored legislation to do all of those things &amp; we need to get them signed into law as soon as possible."
