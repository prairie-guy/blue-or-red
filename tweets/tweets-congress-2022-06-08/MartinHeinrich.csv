MartinHeinrich,"The upper Gila is one of the last wild and free-flowing segments of river in New Mexico and the entire Southwest.
 
We have a duty to keep it that way. #GilaWildAndScenic https://t.co/zJ3x3Ch2vU"
MartinHeinrich,This extension makes sure many will get the compensation they deserve. But I wonâ€™t stop fighting for resources to clean up radioactive legacy waste left behind and expand coverage to all of those impacted in New Mexicoâ€™s Tularosa Basin.
MartinHeinrich,"So many New Mexicans were impacted by radiation exposure in the years that led up to and during the United Statesâ€™ engagement in WWII and the Cold War. Those New Mexicans, and their children and grandchildren, continue to cope with serious health problems today. https://t.co/8m4gdYGktE"
MartinHeinrich,"New Mexicoâ€™s Land Grant Permanent Fund is valued at $25 billion. We can keep that money sitting in the bank in perpetuity, or we can invest more of those dollars in our kids right now. https://t.co/CqB9J4P4Pl"
MartinHeinrich,"Happy Birthday, my friend! https://t.co/bfz9ptVh7N"
MartinHeinrich,"In @EnergyDems now for a committee hearing on our bill to protect the Gila River as #WildAndScenic.
Â 
This bill is the result of years of advocacy by community members who want to see their local rivers protected. Itâ€™s time we honor their fight with permanent action. https://t.co/J7wtGbBWFe"
MartinHeinrich,"We need to do right by the servicemembers who have sacrificed so much for our country.

Letâ€™s get this historic, bipartisan toxic exposure bill over the finish line. https://t.co/mcbLrzIoIs"
MartinHeinrich,"Every veteran exposed to toxins should have VA health care benefits that get them the care they need. 
 
I will be proud to vote for the Honoring Our PACT Act."
MartinHeinrich,"Spent some time with a few Bolson Tortoises last week. DYK, they are the largest land tortoises in North America? https://t.co/7hGqyFVEP5"
MartinHeinrich,"With these investments, we are now on track to triple American solar manufacturing capacity by 2024.

MartinHeinrich,"No air pollution in your home. No big fluctuations in monthly energy bills. No reliance on dirty fossil fuels.

Iâ€™m a big fan. #HeatPump https://t.co/1fhWXtpssr"
MartinHeinrich,"HUGE NEWS: @POTUS is ramping up heat pump production right here at home with the Defense Production Act. 

Heat pumps make the air in your home healthier and your monthly energy bills lower. This move will make them cheaper &amp; help cut our reliance on dirty, foreign fossil fuels."
MartinHeinrich,"President Biden has announced there will NOT be any new tariffs on the solar industry for two years.

This and the acceleration of solar projects in the U.S. is a massive relief for solar workers/businesses in NM.

This is how we make sure America leads the worldâ€™s energy future."
MartinHeinrich,Iâ€™m glad to welcome @POTUS to NM next weekend. Wildfires have devastated our homes and businesses. Iâ€™m looking forward to a real conversation about how the climate crisis is having drastic implications on how we support our communities and prepare for and respond to wildfires.
MartinHeinrich,Got a look at our state-of-the-art ZiaMet Weather Station Network yesterday. This system of weather stations in New Mexico provides real time weather data to more rural areas of our state. Iâ€™m very proud to have secured funding to help this network expand. https://t.co/EiwfsDynEl
MartinHeinrich,"DYK: The new addition to New Mexicoâ€™s protected public lands is home to more than 400 species of plants and animals. Permanent protection means that critical habitat for wildlife, including the Mt. Taylor elk herd and the threatened Mexican spotted owl, will be preserved. https://t.co/JDGjUkZRs5"
MartinHeinrich,"Itâ€™s official. This historic land in New Mexico is now protected and available to the public forever.

MartinHeinrich,"I refuse to accept the idea that we're so polarized we canâ€™t find a real path forward on gun reform.
 
Iâ€™m working with a bipartisan group of Senators to find the common ground and take action.
 
We have a responsibility to do everything we can to stop this senseless violence."
MartinHeinrich,This landscape was also protected for future generations thanks in large part to federal dollars from the Pittman-Roberston Wildlife Restoration Act. I can't wait for New Mexicans to see just how special this place is.
MartinHeinrich,"I am deeply grateful to all of the partnersâ€”including @tpl_org, Tribal Nations, and the State of New Mexicoâ€”who have made this incredible example of landscape-scale conservation happen."
MartinHeinrich,"There is also abundant habitat teeming with wildlife, including large herds of elk that range from its northeastern foothills all the way to the plateau of Mt. Taylor."
MartinHeinrich,"I'm thrilled to welcome the greatest addition to NM's protected public lands in a generation. The high mesas, dramatic volcanic cones, and wide-open valleys near the iconic Mt. Taylor are home to cultural sites for the Pueblos of Acoma, Laguna, and Zuni, and the Navajo Nation. https://t.co/d4ADIZMDYs"
MartinHeinrich,"Yesterday, I visited the Whitfield Conservation Area to get an update on their recovery from Aprilâ€™s Big Hole Fire.
 
The work they are doing here is a great example of how we can manage and recover from fires in this new climate reality. https://t.co/ZUfqTgsKLu"
