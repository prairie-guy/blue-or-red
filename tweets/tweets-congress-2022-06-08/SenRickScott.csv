SenRickScott,"The Biden admin is clueless. Not only have they ignored my calls for over a year to fight fraud, waste and abuse of taxpayer-funded COVID unemployment relief, but they have ZERO IDEA how many of Americans‚Äô tax dollars have been stolen.
¬†
@JoeBiden is confused &amp; unfit to lead. https://t.co/OaW5XoUzCF"
SenRickScott,"üö®WATCHüö®I heard from @USTravel today on how we can get our international travel fully re-opened. Doing so is critical to America‚Äôs economy:
1Ô∏è‚É£End pre-departure COVID testing 
2Ô∏è‚É£Expedite visa wait time backlogs 
3Ô∏è‚É£Encourage convention &amp; trade shows in the U.S. https://t.co/lYbU7b7nHZ"
SenRickScott,".@JoeBiden‚Äôs been in Washington for decades &amp; has NEVER stood up for the people of LATAM &amp; their freedom. 

At the Summit of the Americas this week, Biden must FINALLY stand up for freedom &amp; democracy in LATAM &amp; stop appeasing brutal dictators. https://t.co/I8FIE5uC68"
SenRickScott,"üö®As the Ranking Member, I‚Äôll be hearing from witnesses in @SenateCommerce Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade &amp; Export Promotion at 3:00 PM on how we can be helpful in facilitating the full return of international travel &amp; get people back to work. Tune in! https://t.co/zGMs1eoliI https://t.co/ISssR7L0kT"
SenRickScott,"‚ÄúEverything that they can?‚Äù Wrong. @JoeBiden has done NOTHING to drive down skyrocketing gas prices. He created a crisis that is devastating families &amp; now he‚Äôs turned his back on all of us.

If Biden refuses to fix this &amp; end his war on U.S. energy, he should resign. https://t.co/zJX6MuxJ8N"
SenRickScott,Congratulations to Ken Graham on being selected as the new @NWSDirector! I‚Äôve worked closely with Ken during his years as @NHC_Atlantic Director &amp; look forward to seeing him lead the @NWS. Wishing him the best of luck in this well-deserved new position. https://t.co/fvwMUShV9H
SenRickScott,"üö®ICYMI: @JoeBiden‚Äôs ‚ÄúPlan to Fight Inflation‚Äù made clear what Americans have known for well over a year: the president is heartlessly disconnected from the pain his policies have caused families &amp; he has no idea how to curb inflation.

SenRickScott,"Los dem√≥cratas creen que pueden comprar medios conservadores, pero no silenciar√°n las voces hispanas y a los pueblos amantes de libertad de Cuba, Venezuela y Latinoam√©rica."
SenRickScott,"Democrats believe they can buy conservative media, but they will not silence Hispanic voices and the freedom-loving people of Cuba, VZ and all of LATAM. https://t.co/55wbh2GlqL"
SenRickScott,"Really? You‚Äôre bragging right now?

The day before you took office, inflation was 1.4% and the average cost of gas was $2.39 per gallon.

Today, inflation is 8.3% and gas is nearly $5 per gallon.

Under your admin, American families are suffering. https://t.co/MywMO7UAM3"
SenRickScott,My dad was among the brave soldiers of the 82nd Airborne in Normandy who valiantly fought against tyranny on #DDay.

SenRickScott,".@JoeBiden bows to Communist China &amp; ignores human rights AGAIN.
¬†
This will likely increase U.S. imports of solar panels made through Uyghur forced labor in Xinjiang. The Biden admin must stand against forced labor &amp; prevent tax dollars from funding this horrific abuse. https://t.co/eZfmYalZdF"
SenRickScott,"It‚Äôs absolutely INSANE that the Biden admin actually thinks they can‚Äôt fix skyrocketing gas prices caused by their socialist Green New Deal policies‚Äô own doing. 

Failure after failure, @JoeBiden has shown he is incompetent and unfit to lead. https://t.co/xZHhhyBAhG"
SenRickScott,The baby formula shortage is a crisis of Biden‚Äôs making. This is a massive failure that‚Äôs hurting families &amp; it‚Äôs insane that the Biden admin wouldn‚Äôt have all hands on deck - especially @SecRaimondo. (2/2)
SenRickScott,"Is it really possible that the SECRETARY OF COMMERCE is not involved in the admin‚Äôs response to a baby formula shortage driven by ongoing supply chain issues they‚Äôve refused to solve? 

Unfortunately, yes. That‚Äôs how incompetent @JoeBiden is. (1/2) https://t.co/Eh8IjH2T6Q"
SenRickScott,"Thirty-three years ago, the Chinese Communist Party massacred thousands of innocent democracy activists.
