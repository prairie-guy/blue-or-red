RepLowenthal,"Proud to see France honor Long Beach’s own Billie Jean King in recognition of her contributions to women’s sports, gender equality &amp; LGBTQ rights.

RepLowenthal,"I have spent more than 30yrs, 1st as an activist &amp; then as a public servant, fighting for the rights of the LGBTQ+ community. As a proud member of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus &amp; an even prouder community ally, I look forward to celebrating Pride Month this year. 4/5"
RepLowenthal,"No American should be bullied, fear for their life, or be treated like a second-class citizen because of who they are or who they love. We must stand against these attacks. The Senate must pass the Equality Act so LGBTQ+ Americans cannot be discriminated against. 3/5"
RepLowenthal,"Republican-led statehouses across the country have begun enacting anti-LGBTQ+ laws that are grounded in bigotry, hatred, and ignorance. Rhetoric vilifying members of the LGBTQ+ community has returned to the forefront of conversation by conservative demagogues. 2/5"
RepLowenthal,"As we move into Pride Month, a time of celebration, remembrance, &amp; rededication, this year we must acknowledge the growing attacks against the LGBTQ+ community. Our nation has made immense progress toward equality for all Americans, but these attacks are concerning. 1/5"
