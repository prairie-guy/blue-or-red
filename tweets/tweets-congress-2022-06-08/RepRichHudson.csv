RepRichHudson,"As a dad, I want to do everything we can to protect children in school.

My STOP II, Secure Every School &amp; Protect Our Nation’s Children Act will do just that.

Instead of anti-#2A gun control, we can make schools safer, improve mental health &amp; save lives.

RepRichHudson,"Democrats &amp; the media say ""do something"" on gun control or do nothing. But there's a 3rd option: Do something that matters.

If gun control worked, Chicago would be the safest city in America.

Instead I'm introducing a bill to protect schools, improve mental health &amp; save lives: https://t.co/wejHdZjgEN"

RepRichHudson,"Read more by @AWRHawkins about my bill to protect schools without threatening #2A rights of law-abiding citizens.

From @BreitbartNews: ""There is a third choice, and that’s to enact some policies that will actually have an impact, that will actually prevent school shootings."" https://t.co/KW5PJdg1xB"
RepRichHudson,"This week, I am introducing legislation to harden our schools, address mental health, and protect children.

As gun control bills are debated in Congress, @SteveScalise previewed our @HouseGOP common sense solutions that will actually save lives.

RepRichHudson,Today we remember and honor those from the 82nd Airborne and across our Armed Forces who turned the tide of #WWII and changed the course of history 78 years ago. #DDay https://t.co/s6z2RFapag
RepRichHudson,"Last week, @RepBentz called out Democrats for ignoring school safety legislation I will introduce this week, along with other proposals by the @HouseGOP.

We have common sense solutions that will save lives, yet Democrats continue to play politics instead of come to the table. https://t.co/0tX15MozDU"
RepRichHudson,"Washington Democrats are focused on a radical gun control agenda that only targets law-abiding citizens. I am focused on solutions that build on the STOP School Violence Act to fund SROs and mental health, close loopholes in school security, and better equip law enforcement."
RepRichHudson,"Today’s Judiciary markup has been a missed opportunity to achieve real progress.

House Republicans want to save children’s lives and have come to the table with solutions. Yet Democrats are ignoring the need to harden schools and improve mental health.
