RepBice,Tune in to hear what I‚Äôm up to this week in Washington! https://t.co/9ojp1nQzTr
RepBice,"First inflation wasn't a problem, then it was transitory. Now the Biden Admin finally understands the seriousness of sky-rocketing inflation. American families cannot afford these significant rising prices and we cannot spend our way out of this crisis. #Bidenflation https://t.co/w1IbBLDPaw"
RepBice,"Another out-of-touch move by the Biden Admin. We need an all-encompassing energy approach, but this does nothing to lower the prices at the pump for American families. We should unleash American energy independence now! https://t.co/qK1UtTgZAZ"
RepBice,"Got to meet @OSUcoachG and the entire @CowgirlSB team today! As a proud @OKStateAlumni, I will be rooting for @OSUAthletics tonight in their game. Good luck and #GoPokes! https://t.co/p6mEZg1qk7"
RepBice,I'm incredibly honored to receive this award from the Oklahoma Veterans Council. Supporting our true American patriots and their selfless families is a top priority of mine in Congress. I will always fight for those who have dedicated themselves to serving our great nation. https://t.co/EGW0hkMJTy
RepBice,"üö® Gas prices have hit a new ALL-TIME HIGH, yet again üö® 

Americans are paying on average $4.87 a gallon and will spend over $2000 more on gas this year than last year.

The solution is clear. We must reverse Biden's anti-energy policies and unleash American production."
RepBice,We remember and honor the the allied forces who stormed the beaches of Normandy 78 years ago today. Their fierce bravery and sacrifice will never be forgotten. https://t.co/5Dc3ktko8T
RepBice,"Proud to introduce a resolution honoring the USS Oklahoma City and the many servicemembers who served on her. This vessel traveled around the globe and served in the War on Terror and protected U.S. interests and security internationally.

RepBice,"Since the very beginning, the Biden Admin has been wrong on inflation, which is a direct result of their policy decisions and out-of-control spending. Sadly, Americans are paying the price every time they fill up their gas tank or grocery shop.

RepBice,"The baby formula shortage crisis is still very real for Oklahomans and families across the country. It's critical that we pass @RepStefanik, @cathymcmorris, @RepAshleyHinson and my bill, the Babies Need Formula Now Act, to effectively address the root cause of this dire issue."
