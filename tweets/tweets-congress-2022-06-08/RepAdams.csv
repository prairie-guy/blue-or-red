RepAdams,Please join me in remembering Commissioner Ella Scarborough this morning. I'm celebrating her life on the House Floor now. https://t.co/Y8GYn3Yx0H https://t.co/aJzqfUzang
RepAdams,"President Trump approved $6.552 Trillion in spending for FY 2020 with a deficit of $3.132 Trillion, the largest in history and the largest as percentage of GDP since World War II.

… but I don’t see you calling it Trumpflation. https://t.co/R5e5HzD7MJ"
RepAdams,Thinking of our friend and former colleague @Abby4Iowa as we introduce this legislation today. https://t.co/WHEraAWsJB
RepAdams,"Saddened to hear of the passing of “Mother Margaret” Alexander, a stalwart leader in Charlotte’s civil rights movement. 

Her work deserves to be remembered.

My prayers are with her sons Kelly and Alfred, the entire Alexander family, and everyone who was blessed by her life. https://t.co/YVyDWQXaBW"
RepAdams,"Some people are willing to trade our kids for their guns.

Well, I’m not willing to live with this, and neither are you.

This week @HouseDemocrats are going to take action by passing common-sense gun reforms. Again.

It’s past time for the Senate and Republicans to join us. https://t.co/eEHpCICxL5"
RepAdams,Happy #Pride Charlotte! https://t.co/TUrVjVYNcC
RepAdams,@CastroRoot @ChelseaCirruzzo @theobserver Welcome to Charlotte!
RepAdams,"There were six murders in Charlotte last week.

Over 75% of the murders committed in Charlotte so far this year involved a firearm.

At some point our country has to admit that the guns are the problem."
RepAdams,"People around the world watch American TV and movies.

They play American video games. 

They listen to our music. 

They deal with mental illness and crime.

The time for excuses is over. It’s the guns and we know it. #WearOrange https://t.co/HXHdgrYN2s"
RepAdams,"My prayers are with the City of Brotherly Love this morning, as well as the victims, the survivors, and their families and friends.

For them and many others, I will vote for comprehensive measures to address our country’s gun violence epidemic this week. https://t.co/7OkQKhCPTt"
RepAdams,"In case you missed it, you can watch the replay of our Gun Violence Awareness Day virtual event here: https://t.co/mSXynksXnM via @YouTube"

RepAdams,I'm an original cosponsor of the Assault Weapons Ban Act since it was introduced on March 11th last year. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/xZcqLQJaLK
RepAdams,"Please join me this Friday and #WearOrange to stand up to gun violence in our schools, our towns, our places of worship, and across our county. https://t.co/CdyPhkS53g"
RepAdams,"Some kids have two moms.
Some kids have trans uncles.
Some kids have nonbinary siblings.

Instead of protecting them from gun violence, many state legislatures are telling these kids not to talk about their families or lives.

It's hateful, it's undue, and it's a brand-new #HB2."
RepAdams,Happy Pride Month! https://t.co/Jh9DzxMDXk
