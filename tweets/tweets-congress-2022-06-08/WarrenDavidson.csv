WarrenDavidson,"The legislation is authored by @RepThomasMassie; I am one of many cosponsors. The bill ends the federal mandate for Gun-Free School Zones,  empowering every school district (who‚Äôs state permits) to set requirements for arming and training staff. https://t.co/YgRWQ97GTs"

WarrenDavidson,"Whenever someone says, ‚ÄúThe government should fund _x_ for me / others.‚Äù They‚Äôre really saying, ‚ÄúMy neighbors and you, or your grandkids and you, should‚Ä¶‚Äù."
WarrenDavidson,"Markets send important signals. #SoundMoney could have prevented it, earlier action could have mitigated it, but unfortunately it‚Äôs hurting the most vulnerable people most. Thankfully, stopping Build Back Better has prevented even worse conditions. Brace for impact. https://t.co/zfaM7nTwb1"
WarrenDavidson,Great. It will take effect before the fall season with very little disruption - if our state Senate and Governor finally take action. https://t.co/twZAPB67Rs
WarrenDavidson,"It‚Äôs almost like markets are rational- eventually. The good news? Policies that produce growth and investment are proving attractive. More freedom, less government, #SoundMoney. https://t.co/l1KgNm8lln"

my colleague and founder of the 2nd Amendment Caucus, @RepThomasMassie defending freedom. https://t.co/XKvXSU8IG3"
WarrenDavidson,It‚Äôs clear that the Biden Administration‚Äôs objectives have little in common with what‚Äôs good for America‚Äôs citizens. No wonder they have such contempt for our Constitution.

WarrenDavidson,"Thank you for introducing this common sense legislation. This is a great complement for Ohio‚Äôs legislation to empower every school board in our state to arm and train staff. Sadly, Gun-Free Zones become targets. https://t.co/dgTKDsHKAp"
WarrenDavidson,"@Geiiga @RepublicanStudy Lastly, the Federal Reserve and regulators have made saving nearly impossible. While high net worth people (accredited investors) can save with interest, retail investors cannot shield savings by earning interest. Instead, they are driven to stocks, driving asset price inflation."
WarrenDavidson,"@Geiiga @RepublicanStudy The #FairTax addresses the need for essentials - which could go untaxed. Anti-trust is an extension of making markets function, as is intellectual property protection. Some laws, just not economic distortions. Normally, big business loves big government, but not anti-trust &amp; IP."
WarrenDavidson,"@prestonjbyrne Painful reminder. #SoundMoney is not optional... 

As Thomas Sowell recognized: ""The first lesson of economics is scarcity: there is never enough of anything to fully satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics."""
WarrenDavidson,"@Geiiga Thus, the correction. Tax differently. Also, it's massively more efficient to tax consumption."
WarrenDavidson,@prestonjbyrne Think how badly this idea would work. It would literally prevent price discovery in commodity markets. Wesley Mooch couldn't dream up something so bad - and he is fiction.
WarrenDavidson,"@Geiiga The rich are highly taxed, until some become so wealthy they never need to sell assets or draw a paycheck. Then the income tax fails. Consumption taxes would tax the rich much more progressively. Income tax is also a massive, manipulative privacy grab by government. #Repeal16A"
WarrenDavidson,"Everyone who understands economics and history, including proponents of Modern Monetary Theory, knows that CPI is a lagging indicator for inflation. Monetary inflation debases the currency, inflates  assets (growing the wealth gap), and finally CPI - harming the most vulnerable. https://t.co/kSV9M9NzFG"

How should America provide accountability for those who have stolen from us by willfully weakening the alliance? Not by spending 5X their amount on Ukraine‚Ä¶ #"
WarrenDavidson,This is one of many reasons NATO doesn‚Äôt need a ‚Äúnew strategic concept‚Äù. NATO is a DEFENSIVE alliance of member countries - not a global governance organization.

WarrenDavidson,"@Tangie0906 @All435Reps Who was correct? 

Powell: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about inflation. CPI is only 1.4%‚Äù

Davidson: ‚ÄúThis will fuel inflation! CPI is a lagging indicator. Look first to monetary inflation and asset price inflation.‚Äù"
