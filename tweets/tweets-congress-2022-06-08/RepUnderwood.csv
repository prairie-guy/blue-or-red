RepUnderwood,I was fortunate to host a Veterans Pinning Ceremony to honor Vietnam-era veterans in our community for their service to our country. We must recognize how much they’ve sacrificed to keep our country safe. https://t.co/1KUvKHlZUF

I support @US_FDA’s efforts to eliminate menthol cigarettes and protect future generations from addiction — we must end this cycle."
