PattyMurray,"Food banks, soup kitchens, &amp; food pantries have provided critical relief to so many WA state families, but they’ve also been hard to reach for some people living in remote, rural, or Tribal communities. I secured resources from @USDA to help fix that. https://t.co/Z9wnJwmdI9"
PattyMurray,"I am ready to work with anyone to get anything passed that may help save lives—Republican or Democrat. We can’t stand by and let the status quo continue. Senate Republicans, it’s your move. The country is watching. https://t.co/RIJVFtSB2C"

PattyMurray,Borrowers ripped off by Corinthian can finally breathe a sigh of relief knowing they’ll no longer be saddled with debt &amp; anxiety. I’m glad the Biden Admin is delivering real relief for so many defrauded borrowers—including nearly 17k people in WA state. https://t.co/mkGe8yUPHy
