RepJasonCrow,"We've come a long way in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality, but there's still work to do.

With too many acts of violence against the LGBTQ+ community, I’m pushing to pass the Equality Act protecting LGBTQ+ folks from harassment &amp; discrimination. #PrideMonth https://t.co/Y0v7o30fN1"
RepJasonCrow,"I was elected to make policies &amp; a big part of that is public safety–the safety of our roads, our food, our families.

The gun violence epidemic is a public safety hazard.

We must pass policies to put an end to these horrific mass shootings that endanger our communities. https://t.co/X2WAP5BjVo"
RepJasonCrow,"Guns are the #1 cause of death for American kids.

It doesn't have to be this way—Americans agree on commonsense reforms.

This #GunViolenceAwarenessMonth the House is voting on some of these measures. If @SenateGOP won’t negotiate, we must #EndTheFilibuster &amp; stop gun violence."
RepJasonCrow,"The Columbine shooting happened in 1999 &amp; there still hasn’t been meaningful progress on gun safety.

Today we #WearOrange as a united call to end the gun violence epidemic.

I’m done with moments of silence followed by inaction. 

RT if you agree we need progress NOW. https://t.co/76CNbEU4fN"
RepJasonCrow,"NEW: The freedom to make our own healthcare decisions shouldn’t end when we enter the gates of a military base.

Proud to join @RepSpeier in introducing the MARCH for Servicemembers Act so servicemembers &amp; their spouses have access to abortion even on-base. https://t.co/yWsZ0s2yX0"
RepJasonCrow,"Thoughts and prayers last week didn’t stop this horrible shooting from happening.

We don’t have to live like this.

RepJasonCrow,"Every week I talk to parents, students, &amp; teachers in CO who are traumatized by mass shootings.

I’m sick of my colleagues just sending thoughts &amp; prayers, but not doing a damn thing about gun violence.

This is a public safety issue. We can &amp; we must pass policies to fix it. https://t.co/eRjPkcTk0M"
