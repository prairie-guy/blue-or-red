SenGaryPeters,"Welcome to Michigan, @FLOevcharging!
 
Excited to see a new manufacturing plant will be coming to Oakland County which will strengthen our state's economy, create good-paying jobs and further cement Michigan’s position as a leader in mobility for generations to come. https://t.co/z6Z9ciZff6"
SenGaryPeters,"For nearly 50 yrs women have had the right to make their own health care decisions. Soon SCOTUS' ruling will impact whether women can keep accessing critical care, including an abortion.

Have you been impacted by Roe v. Wade? Share your story with me. https://t.co/Uyt57vNOGY"
SenGaryPeters,"It is unacceptable that veterans exposed to harmful substances while serving our nation are unable to get the care they’ve earned.

We must pass this bipartisan legislation to ensure every veteran can access long-overdue health care benefits. https://t.co/sRfKMdrXeX"
SenGaryPeters,"Excited to join @DTE_Energy in St. Clair County to celebrate the ribbon-cutting of their new Blue Water Energy Center.

SenGaryPeters,"78 years ago, Allied forces courageously stormed the beaches of Normandy &amp; began the liberation of Europe.

As the son of a WWII veteran &amp; French mother who lived under Nazi occupation, #DDay is personal to me. Grateful to the men &amp; women who defeated evil in its worst forms."
SenGaryPeters,"Whether it's our Great Lakes, shorelines or forests—Michigan’s natural resources are precious treasures we must protect for future generations.

SenGaryPeters,Michiganders expect us to work together to find common ground and get results. I joined @SenStabenow at the #MPC22 this week to discuss how we're working to reach across the aisle to address the challenges facing Michigan &amp; our nation. https://t.co/UkUWWj2vOb
SenGaryPeters,"On #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, we must recommit to honoring the victims &amp; survivors of gun violence along with their families through action. The Senate must address this epidemic w/ the urgency it demands by passing legislation to reduce gun violence, improve safety &amp; save lives."
SenGaryPeters,Appreciated joining @UAW Region 1-D retirees at their annual conference at UAW Black Lake. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Michigan auto workers define what it means to be an American worker and these retirees know firsthand the importance and value of organized labor. https://t.co/auzvNqTHZG
SenGaryPeters,"This is great news!
 
My office worked with the City to support this request of @USACEHQ funds. This will help ensure Pentwater’s channel to Lake Michigan can continue to harbor incoming traffic and serve as a robust engine for local commerce and tourism.https://t.co/XK8ehcLHek"
SenGaryPeters,The future of the auto industry is electric—and these electric vehicles are going to be built right here in Michigan by Michigan @UAW workers. Great news from @Ford! https://t.co/nmiIaxjFDt
SenGaryPeters,"Happy #PrideMonth to the LGBTQ+ community in Michigan &amp; across the country!
 
Let’s take this time to recognize the progress made—honor those across generations who courageously fought for justice—and continue working towards equality under the law."
SenGaryPeters,"People expect us to work together regardless of party to get things done—that’s how @SenStabenow and I have continued delivering results for Michiganders.

Enjoyed the discussion today about civility &amp; reaching across the aisle at @DetroitChamber’s #MPC22. https://t.co/TDJ5DnUPNf"
SenGaryPeters,"It was great to meet with @SecretaryPete today at #MPC22 to talk future of mobility—and why Michigan is in a prime position to continue leading in innovation.

I’ll keep working to create a comprehensive &amp; safe federal framework for new mobility technologies. https://t.co/UEcAdsQH2m"
