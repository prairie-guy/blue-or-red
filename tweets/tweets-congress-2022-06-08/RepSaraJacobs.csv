RepSaraJacobs,"The U.S. must also work to fill the gap in global food needs, particularly in East Africa, as we continue to see rising famine conditions exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. https://t.co/lPVAo3EcXw"
RepSaraJacobs,"ðŸ§µ:Russia is using hunger as a weapon of war in Ukraine - and now theyâ€™re also trying to profit from it by selling stolen grain. In February, I introduced a bipartisan resolution urging the U.S. to prioritize humanitarian &amp; food security efforts and that need has only increased."
RepSaraJacobs,"How many more lives will be enough? The rate of gun violence in America is unbearable, and we have an obligation to act.
This week, I will proudly vote for the Protecting Our Kids Act, a commonsense gun violence prevention package to protect our communities and save lives."
RepSaraJacobs,"If abortion is criminalized , data collected by apps and websites could be used to target people. My legislation, the My Body, My Data Act would prevent this, strengthen consumer protections, and give people the ability to fight back. https://t.co/C36lN8F7Hw"
RepSaraJacobs,"Happy National #PrideMonth! This month and every month (and I can't wait for San Diego Pride in July), I'm committed to fighting for LGBTQ+ equality. Pride is both a celebration and a protest, and I wonâ€™t stop pushing for the liberation that queer and trans people deserve. https://t.co/G7XbI38mte"
RepSaraJacobs,"The My Body, My Data Act would create a new national standard to protect personal reproductive health data. By minimizing the personal reproductive health data that is collected and retained, the bill would prevent this information from being disclosed or misused. https://t.co/n0selTiFL5"
RepSaraJacobs,"Proud to support these two queer and Asian-owned local businesses, and always grateful for the transformative work of San Diego Pride. https://t.co/mzKOGvX38J"
RepSaraJacobs,What a perfect way to close out #AAPIHeritageMonth and begin #PrideMonth -- my team joined @sandiegopride at @stellajeansicecream and @eatpoppie to celebrate our queer and trans Asian and Pacific Islander community. https://t.co/BPRn5fpBAh
RepSaraJacobs,"Iâ€™ve heard from so many people who are panicked about their personal reproductive health data falling into the wrong hands. The My Body, My Data Act will protect that information, protect our privacy, and reaffirm our rights to make our own decisions about our bodies. https://t.co/A5KXMLP33i"
RepSaraJacobs,"The news today is exhausting â€” three near-simultaneous shootings in Tulsa, Pittston, and LA.

My heart is with those who are grieving tonight, and those who lost their lives to this horrific violence."

RepSaraJacobs,"My heart breaks for the families in Buffalo and Uvalde who are burying their loved ones this week and adjusting to their painful new reality. Everywhere I've gone this week, I've heard from constituents begging Congress to act against gun violence. We have to get this done."
RepSaraJacobs,"Happy National Pride Month! #Pride is about justice, equality, dignity â€“ and for me and many others, itâ€™s about family. Today is #LGBTQFamiliesDay, and Iâ€™m thinking of the LGBTQ+ parents and kids, and the LGBTQ+ chosen families, who need welcoming schools, health care, and more. https://t.co/xio8FS4OOE"
