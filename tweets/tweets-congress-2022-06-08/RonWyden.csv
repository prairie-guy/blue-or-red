RonWyden,Oregon is still struggling to rebuild after two horrific fire seasons in a row. I’m pressing federal officials to ensure Oregonians have the funding and workforce our state needs to effectively battle these blazes in the upcoming fire season. https://t.co/EwtBH9mAtD
RonWyden,Welcome to @OregonState Dr. Jayathi Murthy. You’re going to love Corvallis and the entire OSU community. #GoBeavs https://t.co/bbXSZMIakV
RonWyden,The supporters of this Saudi-affiliated golf tour coming to Oregon at the end of June are shamelessly pocketing blood money being “sports-washed” by a regime that murders journalists &amp; helps its nationals escape U.S. justice in our state &amp; nationwide. https://t.co/XiRRSlBbWW
RonWyden,"Congrats to @BeaverBaseball for today’s big win in Corvallis, advancing to the Super Regionals and taking one huge step on the #RoadtoOmaha. #GoBeavs"
RonWyden,Decisions about what should happen to children and families are far too important to be made by untested algorithms. I’m glad @ORHumanServices is taking the concerns I raised about racial bias seriously and is pausing the use of its AI screening tool. https://t.co/k2aGI2Vrk6
RonWyden,"Hood River County residents asked great questions at Friday’s #2022townhall about vote-by-mail, recreation, public lands, the climate crisis, drought, guns &amp; more. Big thanks to the @gorge_news for hosting me in Hood River &amp; @PeoplesTH for moderating. https://t.co/V9In6iZWST"
RonWyden,I’m glad to have set up these online sessions to get answers to Eastern Oregon veterans’ questions and to work together on providing them the quality health care they earned here at home with their service for our country.
RonWyden,"At this weekend’s first of three scheduled town halls focusing on veterans in Eastern Oregon, rural veterans voiced their justifiable concerns to the VA about its health care delivery delays, service cuts and other changes that move treatment farther away. https://t.co/BqXcC6PGJD"
RonWyden,This #GunViolenceAwarenessMonth I #WearOrange to remember the lives ripped away by gun violence in Oregon and nationwide. I'm all in every day to work on passing common-sense legislation like universal background checks that can reduce the risks of these atrocities. https://t.co/DpMWqnEPMu
RonWyden,"Thanks Wasco County for a thoughtful discussion about the climate crisis, gun violence, wildfires, tribal fishing &amp; more during today’s #2022townhall hosted at the @gorge_news office here in The Dalles. And thanks to @PeoplesTH for helping these #OregonWay conversations happen. https://t.co/lmz9TWfUZG"
RonWyden,Always glad to “wing it” with @hwhouston1. https://t.co/VekGsQIdlm
RonWyden,And I’m fighting to raise pay for the courageous firefighters defending Oregon communities against these destructive blazes: https://t.co/MY949IfhYt
RonWyden,Heard today in Bend from @CentralORFire &amp; @DesNatlForest officials about prep for what’s expected to be another tough wildfire season. I’m working to ensure the $ for forest health &amp; fire risk reductions I got into the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law gets put to good use statewide. https://t.co/p8qM2cULhg
RonWyden,"Happy #PrideMonth to everyone celebrating the history, accomplishments and vital contributions of the LGBTQ+ community across Oregon and the country. Today and every day, I remain committed to fighting to make our country a more just and equitable place for all."
RonWyden,"Great conversation with Deschutes County at yesterday’s #2022townhall from @thebulletin here in Bend about finding common ground for common-sense solutions on wildfires, health care, public lands, gun violence &amp; more. Thanks to @PeoplesTH and all who participated. https://t.co/Pyj8sVSdD9"
RonWyden,I’m not going to stop pressing for a halt to this disgraceful spectacle coming to Washington County — and for Greg Norman and any other supporters of this Saudi tour to quit “sportswashing” bloodstained Saudi hands.
RonWyden,"This Saudi-backed golf tournament coming to Oregon is a cruel insult to the family of Fallon Smart, a 15-year-old Portlander killed in a hit-and-run by a Saudi national whose government has helped him escape U.S. justice. https://t.co/xefH6IWlP8"
