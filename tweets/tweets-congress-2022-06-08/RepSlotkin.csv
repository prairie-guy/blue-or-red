RepSlotkin,This mirrors a bill that was unfortunately blocked in the Michigan Senate just two weeks ago. It comes directly from our experience in Oxford &amp; what our local prosecutor is trying to do in the case of the shooter's parents. 5/5
RepSlotkin,"And if a minor gets ahold of that gun and uses it to commit a crime or hurt someone, you can be held criminally responsible. 4/5"
RepSlotkin,"My bill is a practical approach to help keep our kids safe, in Michigan and across the country. The idea behind the bill is simple: if you’re a gun owner, like millions of Michiganders, you have to take reasonable steps to store your firearm. 3/5"
RepSlotkin,"The day after the shooting in Uvalde, I had already been scheduled to speak at the @OxfordVirtual graduation. It was a deeply emotional moment for the students, their families, and the school staff, with so many raw feelings bubbling back up given the tragedy in Texas. 2/5"
RepSlotkin,"Just after the 6 month anniversary of the shooting at Oxford High School, tomorrow the House will vote on my Safe Guns, Safe Kids Act, the gun storage bill I introduced in the aftermath of the tragedy that upended so many lives in Michigan last November. 1/5"
RepSlotkin,"When it comes to rural broadband, Cohoctah Township is a case study for getting it done. It was great to celebrate an important milestone for the area, made possible by local leadership &amp; federal dollars — proof that when we focus on a common goal, we can accomplish great things. https://t.co/crJkdIFlH4"
RepSlotkin,I’m co-sponsoring the Ban Corporate PACs Act because Americans should know their elected officials are working for the public and not for themselves. Big corporations have had too much influence in our politics for too long. https://t.co/4TYzLJcRct
RepSlotkin,Americans deserve to know their elected leaders have the public’s best interests at heart and aren’t trying to make a quick buck off their position. My Cryptocurrency Accountability Act will improve transparency &amp; help stop the corruption that erodes confidence in our government.
RepSlotkin,"Americans see too many headlines about corrupt dealing by elected officials. As the use of cryptocurrency grows, Members of Congress are already investing – that’s why I’m leading a bipartisan bill to require  disclosure of all crypto holdings &amp; trades. https://t.co/EbBHRXsQcp"
RepSlotkin,"He’s right, and I hope members can embrace the approach used by my colleagues in the @ProbSolveCaucus: rolling up your sleeves, working across the aisle, and hashing out bipartisan solutions that can actually get signed into law."
RepSlotkin,"Third: understanding that decent Republicans and Democrats need each other because, at our best, we make each other’s policies stronger."
RepSlotkin,"Van raised 3 great points - First: encouraging our colleagues to represent the best version of their politics (i.e. asking the other side to be decent &amp; empathetic in their own party, not demanding they switch to your side); Second: not asking for everything &amp; getting nothing."
RepSlotkin,"And in Congress, we need to work harder on building bipartisan from the ground up that will actually pass.  Passing a perfect bill in the House means little if it has no hope in the Senate. And as Van said, there’s a difference between making a point and making progress."
RepSlotkin,"It all starts at the local level, where we need to find ways to bring down the temperature and grow the connective tissue between communities. That means finding things beyond politics that can get us talking to one another to rebuild our relationships and trust."
RepSlotkin,"There’s no denying that our politics have become more polarized, with decency and civility in short supply. So this morning, I sat down with @VanJones &amp; @UMich Prof. Morela Hernandez for a panel to talk about how we can counter division with facts and empathy. https://t.co/SAtVbhj29U"
