SenatorMenendez,"Judge Salas continues to inspire me every day, and sheâ€™s absolutely right. A month after Republicans blocked my unanimous request to pass my Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act, another judge was tragically murdered in Wisconsin. We must pass this bill without delay. https://t.co/npGEYjdQ5O"
SenatorMenendez,"The ripple effects of unabated gun violence reach far beyond the irreparable voids left in our hearts.

Survivors of gun violence are less likely to graduate high school &amp; college and are less likely to find employment as adults. This has longstanding impacts on our communities. https://t.co/34iL6htfXl"

SenatorMenendez,"Millions of Americans have just graduated college, and many of them will go on to careers as nurses, teachers, or social workers. Jobs that our communities so desperately need, but that make it almost impossible to pay off student debt--let alone buy a house or start a family. https://t.co/IXRbfjM4WO"
SenatorMenendez,"Although honestly, this doesnâ€™t even take much courage.

88% of Americans support universal background checks.

Iâ€™m no mathematician, but in a democracy, a choice between the wishes of 88% of ALL AMERICANS or 44% of one party isnâ€™t supposed to be a very tough call."
SenatorMenendez,"44% of Republicans think mass shootings are just something we have to live with.

This report from @nytimes shows that's utterly false. We have the tools to save lives, and we have the data that proves they work. All we need is the courage to act. https://t.co/bdawBNpwXK"
SenatorMenendez,"As @POTUS weighs options to #CancelStudentDebt and reform our student loan system, parents with Parent PLUS loans must not be left out of the equation."
SenatorMenendez,"For a parent, there's no better investment than setting your children up for a successful future. But doing so shouldn't mean sacrificing your own financial security.Â https://t.co/n5TsdibOGo"
SenatorMenendez,"Here's a factoid for my Republican colleagues: rising energy costs &amp; inflation aren't just happening in America, it's a global crisis.

And while families feel the pain at the pump, giant corporations are pocketing billions.

It's time to hold them accountable!

RT if you agree. https://t.co/udzY0O2YCK"
SenatorMenendez,"This story from @MomsRising is one of many I hear each week showing just how much the student debt crisis is hurting NJ families, and why narrow solutions wonâ€™t cut it. We need bold action from @POTUS to #CancelStudentDebt, and to fix the broken system that created this mess. https://t.co/o1Ny2Mgqj0"
SenatorMenendez,Children are our future and deserve every opportunity to succeed - I'm incredibly honored and thankful to the @Campaign4Kids for naming me a 2021 #ChampionforChildren. https://t.co/acg5WDLBbn
SenatorMenendez,"My three granddaughters are younger than the children we lost in Uvalde, but their names â€” Evangelina, Ofelia  Olivia â€” are so, so similar.

What kind of world are we leaving behind for them if we donâ€™t act now? https://t.co/tafgoA98nh"
SenatorMenendez,"Gun violence happens so frequently in this country that it's easy to become desensitized by the numbers.

We cannot let that happen. I want us to continue to say their names, and to carry their stories with us this weekend as we #WearOrange, and every day until we win this fight. https://t.co/8IuzhqMr52"
SenatorMenendez,"Anti-Semitism and discrimination have no place in our state, and I want to know what Lufthansa is doing to hold its employees accountable for their response and to rectify any discriminatory actions these passengers, some of whom are my constituents, faced."
SenatorMenendez,"Lufthansa has a large presence at Newark airport and I am deeply disturbed to hear reports that its employees discriminated against Jewish passengers on a recent flight.

SenatorMenendez,"Let #GunViolenceAwarenessMonth be a reminder to all of us that we must continue to show up, to follow the example of the outstanding young leaders I met with at Memorial High School yesterday, and to demand more than thoughts and prayers."
SenatorMenendez,"I'm glad Republicans are showing at least some willingness to act on gun violence, but let's be crystal clear, these negotiations must be just the beginning of our efforts towards comprehensive gun reform that truly protects all of our communities from this epidemic of violence. https://t.co/XkmRA0jtkU"
SenatorMenendez,"I'm glad we have strong leadership in NJ working around the clock to protect our communities from gun violence.
 
But the patchwork of weaker laws across the country continues to jeopardize public safety in NJ. We need federal action.
https://t.co/h7nWUTWAvf"
SenatorMenendez,"Honored to speak at @AIPACâ€™s NJ Spring Leadership Summit last night about our steadfast commitment to the US-Israel relationship &amp; the interests &amp; values we share. Whether on the Iran threat, or combatting anti-Semitism, our partnership has never been stronger or more necessary. https://t.co/wm6EZwBC56"
SenatorMenendez,"Best of luck to the NJ Students competing in the Scripps National Spelling Bee! All of us in NJ will be cheering for you!
https://t.co/ELwz2SkIiJ"
SenatorMenendez,"Happy #PRIDE Month!
 
In NJ we understand that LGBTQI+ rights are human rights, we recognize that our diversity is our strength, and we seek to empower young LGBTQI+ leaders to continue to push us forward in the fight for full equality. https://t.co/DKjdwg69OU"
SenatorMenendez,"I know that the only acceptable solution to this baby formula shortage is to get the shelves fully restocked as quickly as possible.
