USRepLong,I'm passionate about supporting @StJude and the work they do. It was great to visit with @flubug and Dr. Richard Webby of @StJudeResearch to discuss ongoing projects that affect our #PublicSafety and wellbeing. https://t.co/h7R1C6qpMa
USRepLong,"The largest #MigrantCaravan to date- over 11,000 illegals, expected to grow to 15,000- is headed for the #SouthernBorder. In 2017 @FAIRImmigration estimated illegal immigration cost the U.S. taxpayer $116 billion. But #Democrats continue to encourage illegals w/ their policies. https://t.co/cGUN3FxtbA"
USRepLong,@JoeBiden rewards college degree holders who took out student loans and makes the 63% who don't have a degree or debt pay it off for them. $5.8 billion canceled. More #BidenLogic which @BudgetHawks say will increase #Inflation even more.
USRepLong,"#Bidenflation is costing all Americans. #RealWages are down, and the price of food, energy, and gas is up. As a result, Americans' savings and #RetirementFunds are dwindling. https://t.co/MHazqexa0n"
USRepLong,"The courageous #American, #British, and #Canadian heroes who stormed the #Normandy beaches on this day in 1944 will never be forgotten and stand as a constant reminder that #Freedomisntfree. Springfieldian Jack Hamlin was there and he's back today at 100+. https://t.co/TDenu8sQCh"
USRepLong,"Americans can't find #BabyFormula, and they can't afford the gas they need to search for it. They also struggle to afford the basic groceries needed to get by for the week. We need to reverse failed #Democrat policies and restore #American prosperity."
USRepLong,"Nothing Natural About Natural Gas Prices. This week in Long's Short Report, I talk about the 14 year high we are seeing in natural gas prices, and how that impacts American consumers.

USRepLong,"Next time you see your grocery bill, just remember that it is @JoeBiden’s failed economic policies that created this mess. #Bidenflation is real and all across America, people are feeling it’s devastating impacts."
USRepLong,@JoeBiden's Administration did nothing to prepare for the looming #BabyFormulaShortage. They knew in February that it was coming and did nothing to help the American people.
USRepLong,"Gas prices continue to rise, a side effect of #Bidenflation. President Biden needs to stop his assault on American energy, and #DrillBabyDrill"
