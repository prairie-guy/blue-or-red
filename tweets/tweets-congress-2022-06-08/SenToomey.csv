SenToomey,This is a tragic reminder of what’s at stake as the Biden Admin pushes its liberal open border policies and permits dangerous sanctuary cities.
SenToomey,"The illegal immigrant who caused Kate Steinle's death never should have been on the street or in the U.S. the day Kate was killed.

SenToomey,"While it is nice @SecYellen acknowledges the admin needs Congressional approval to move forward with Pillar One of their international tax agreement, acknowledging they actually must follow our Constitution and submit it to the Senate for approval as a treaty would be better. https://t.co/Qnc8jDNpsM"
SenToomey,"Potential solutions on the table include expanding background checks to include all commercial sales, making it a specific federal offense to engage in gun trafficking, improving security, encouraging mental health, &amp; incentivizing state enactment of red flag laws"
SenToomey,I'm cautiously optimistic Congress can enact commonsense measures that make it less likely for criminals and the dangerously mentally ill to get firearms while protecting the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. https://t.co/oJJB8UxUyz
SenToomey,"Once again, @POTUS is abusing the Defense Production Act—this time to advance his global warming agenda by using taxpayer dollars to build solar panels.

If the administration keeps misusing the DPA for non-defense purposes, Congress must curtail it. https://t.co/EToyB7pbKN"
SenToomey,"Expanded background checks make sense. 

We all agree that violent criminals and dangerously mentally ill people should not have firearms. We need a mechanism to increase the likelihood that we'll identify such a person and prevent them from buying a gun legally. https://t.co/EBFymLe9OD"
SenToomey,"The brutality in Philly last night is devastating to all Pennsylvanians &amp; Americans. My heart goes out to the families mourning the loss of their loved ones. While details are still unknown, it's clear this never should have happened. This horror has no place in America. https://t.co/4YkH3LW4AB"
SenToomey,"With intl turmoil &amp; increasing energy costs, the clear solution is to build out our infrastructure, so we can utilize our plentiful, cheap, clean, &amp; domestic natural gas. 

The Biden Admin instead is moving in the opposite direction with a policy that ignores present challenges. https://t.co/cU9oHXIiby"
SenToomey,I’m optimistic about the direction we're going &amp; look forward to continuing to work together to create the best possible product.
SenToomey,My colleagues and I met yesterday to discuss a path forward for bipartisan legislation that can help prevent other tragedies in America without infringing on law abiding citizens’ Second Amendment rights. https://t.co/9gWgNqBzVZ
SenToomey,"If this news is true, it illustrates how unserious the Biden Administration really is about tackling inflation and how insensitive they are to Americans struggling with high gas and food prices."
SenToomey,"Furthermore, corn that’s mandated to end up in car engines can’t end up on Americans’ plates - making the cost of feeding your family even more.

The American people need relief, not regulatory burdens &amp; additional costs."
SenToomey,The nationwide avg/ gallon of gas costs $4.54. Included in that cost is 20-30 cents/ gallon due to RFS compliance. The higher the renewable fuel volume requirement the higher the cost of gas will be for consumers without any tangible benefit.
SenToomey,"As Americans pay record high gas prices, President Biden is considering raising the Renewable Fuel Standard mandates. This will cost Americans even more when they fill up their tanks and continue to drive up food costs. https://t.co/hAm20Pyfea"
SenToomey,"If President Biden is serious about tackling inflation, he should follow the advice of his own chief economic adviser Cecilia Rouse and ease tariffs, which are nothing more than a tax increase on American consumers. https://t.co/jQD0jThsqp"
