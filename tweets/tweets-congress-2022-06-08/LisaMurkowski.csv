LisaMurkowski,"The U.S. Capitol Visitors Center  had its first public visitors since 2020. I'm excited to share that those visitors were Steve and Louann Hennig of Alaska, whose tour was arranged by my office. I’m proud to welcome all Alaskans and Americans back to the U.S. Capitol. https://t.co/eASX9zwY8Q"
LisaMurkowski,"Now more than ever, we must #UnleashAmericanEnergy. We can’t do that while the Biden administration holds the U.S. back with policies that prevent us from producing what we need. We need to tap into America’s energy—for our energy security, national security &amp; for our economy. https://t.co/88E71qCx9y"
LisaMurkowski,"As an author of the bipartisan infrastructure law, I worked to ensure the needs of Tribes were prioritized. W/ this funding announcement, our Tribes have much-needed support to improve their water &amp; wastewater systems, transportation capabilities &amp; more.

LisaMurkowski,"Through my role on the Appropriations Committee, I’ve prioritized bringing investments to Alaska.

A number of infrastructure projects will soon see major investments thanks to the @USACEHQ. https://t.co/HYnjcYWIOF https://t.co/5VKHNjEjyk"
LisaMurkowski,"Alaska’s energy future is as strong as its future leaders—and I was grateful to meet with several who are part of @VelocityAk. Their work to engage with Alaskans, and highlight the resource industry’s importance to our state and to our lives, is truly inspiring. https://t.co/7gXtYCnYPf"
LisaMurkowski,".@ANTHCtodaY provides outstanding services to many members of Alaska’s Native Community, and with a $27 million investment to their emergency department I secured through Congressionally Directed Spending, I know their mission to help people will only strengthen. https://t.co/wX074b9DSt"
LisaMurkowski,"As the world rallies behind Ukraine’s efforts to defend democracy and against Russia’s unprovoked and barbaric invasion, I’m proud to put my support behind the people of Finland and Sweden as they aim to join NATO. https://t.co/cQPeqiSS3U"

LisaMurkowski,"Going to Manley to see the flood damage, speak to the displaced, and hear firsthand the impact to the community was an important visit—for me to see what role I can play at the federal level to help these Alaskans get back on their feet and recover. https://t.co/hmHN0LWzq1"
LisaMurkowski,"Last month, ice jam flooding caused severe damage to the community of Manley. The rising water hit the town from both sides—homes were flooded, power across the board was shut off for three days, &amp; the community store and Post Office were out of commission for nearly a week. https://t.co/hBcKACrUxc"
