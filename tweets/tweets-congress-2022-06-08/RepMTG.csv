RepMTG,"The American people deserve to know where their member of Congress stands.

That‚Äôs why I just called for recorded votes, and why I‚Äôll keep doing it. https://t.co/UmTj3QRPUs"
RepMTG,"6. But don‚Äôt worry, the Biden admin didn‚Äôt forget to include diversity and union jobs in their strategic abuse of the Defense Production Act while our farmers are on the verge of going out of business bc of the cost of diesel and fertilizer. 

Destroying America is on purpose. https://t.co/rm7bqiQIzw"
RepMTG,"5. Biden is also building solar in Puerto Rico. 

And propping up the Export-Import Bank and using it to ‚Äúsupport building resilient clean energy manufacturing supply chains in allied nations 
around the world.‚Äù

Tell me how this helps Americans afford gas at the pump. https://t.co/RiDZp7oCo1"
RepMTG,"4. Biden is using the Defense Production Act to buy solar modules and cells from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.

This is NOT what the DPA is for. https://t.co/Hxc3Op2p64"
RepMTG,"3. Using the Defense Production Act to prop up the solar industry is unconstitutional and an abuse of presidential authority in this case.

Solar would barely exist if it weren‚Äôt for the steady flow of federal subsidies &amp; tax credits.

The 24-month ‚Äúbridge‚Äù is America Last! https://t.co/TxjJBj4ebF"
RepMTG,"2. This is all part of a scheme to force Americans to drive electric vehicles.

Joe Biden adopted Bernie Sanders‚Äô presidential agenda before the election in Nov 2020.

The Green New Deal was always the plan, as I‚Äôve been warning since day one. https://t.co/KjfWIUg5rF"
RepMTG,"1. The Biden admin is using the Defense Production Act to import solar panels while Americans can‚Äôt afford gas and farmers, truckers, and more can‚Äôt afford diesel.

Democrats are intentionally destroying the oil &amp; gas industry to serve their climate gods.

https://t.co/MoUqlYIEPK"
RepMTG,"üö®üö®üö®CRISIS ALERT

Parents and grandparents are frantically searching for baby formula every day.

The FDA should give emergency permission to more food manufacturers to make baby formula.

Let private companies solve this crisis!  Get the government out of the way! https://t.co/KYON4sOxlG"
RepMTG,"Americans are suffering from out of control inflation &amp; gas prices, high crime, no baby formula, &amp; open border causing record fentanyl deaths.

Dems think people care about J6 after Dems caused violent riots w/ $2+ B in damage all over the US in ‚Äò20.

Yeah.

Dig that hole deeper."
RepMTG,"The Capitol will be crawling with organized &amp; trained gun grabbing activists pressuring politicians to vote yes.

Republicans better vote NO!

Pro-Gun groups take in membership fees &amp; send emails, but never organize &amp; train activism to protect our rights.

That needs to change. https://t.co/KpvSUhwcu8"
RepMTG,"I could care less what 2 consenting adults do sexually, nor do I judge, but when it comes to adults training children sexually, both mentally &amp; physically, I do care.

And so do MOST people.

We must protect children from child  grooming predators &amp; abusers in every way possible."
RepMTG,"It should be illegal to take children into Drag Queen shows and strip clubs. 

And there should be no federal funding for any school that intentionally confuses children about gender/sexuality.

Any teacher or school employee caught doing so should be fired and lose all benefits."
RepMTG,"WHY is this tweet labeled misleading @Twitter?

Pfizer should be investigated immediately.

So should Twitter and any other social media app, media company, tech company, and anyone else who continues to manipulate/hide information about covid vaccines.

Remove the label @Twitter https://t.co/LZmhqtMkOc"
RepMTG,"David, you fundraise for a living.

If you wanted to fix it, you would discuss common sense solutions with me, someone who has also been on lockdown as a student when the only madman with a gun is another student who wants to kill people.

Not just bully my weak RINO colleagues. https://t.co/Cka3jF12jV"
RepMTG,".@davidhogg111 it happened at my high school too, only we had no one.
Scot Peterson was a coward and failed everyone bc he refused to go in.
And there were many more failures that led to that tragic day.
Gun control laws won‚Äôt fix it.
Call my office. Let‚Äôs talk it over. https://t.co/Z4cEUo53em"
RepMTG,".@davidhogg111 I hear you &amp; your girls are funded to come to town this week to once again try to manipulate some of my gutless weak colleagues to vote for gun control that will violate our freedoms and leave Americans defenseless.

I don‚Äôt see you on my schedule, why not?"
RepMTG,"Joe Biden armed the Taliban.

Joe Biden &amp; most of Congress armed Ukraine so they can defend themselves.

Now Joe Biden &amp; most of Congress want to disarm the American people taking away their ability to defend themselves.

And the American taxpayers pay for all it.

Impeach Biden."
RepMTG,"The same people saying ‚ÄúChristian Nationalism‚Äù is dangerous are the same people grooming our children, pushing drag queen shows in elementary &amp; middle schools, teaching gender lies and advocating teenagers go through genital mutilation.

Tell me again who is dangerous."
RepMTG,"A label for God and country.
Oh yeah, I‚Äôm in. https://t.co/V4POu1hbhE"
RepMTG,"Our children deserve to be safe. They deserve to be protected just like politicians. Kids should be guarded with guns.

(4/4)"
RepMTG,"It was that day I knew that guns save lives.

Democrats actually agree. They are protected with armed security everywhere they go. But Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi want to disarm law-abiding citizens while refusing to protect our children like they protect themselves.

(3/4)"
RepMTG,"As our classroom was locked down, my classmates and I wondered who would protect us when the only one there with a gun was the person who wanted to kill other students.

It was terrifying and we needed protection by someone with a gun to stop the madness.

(2/4)"
RepMTG,"I know exactly how it feels to be a student trapped in a school with a mentally ill person on the loose with a gun.

In 1990, in the wake of the Democrat gun-free school zone push, a deranged student brought three guns to my ‚Äúgun-free‚Äù high school.

(1/4) https://t.co/9zqoORH5NU"
RepMTG,"Joe Biden wants to ban ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh capacity magazines‚Äù yet Democrats refuse to prosecute violent crimes in Democrat cities all over the country, and refuse to protect your children at school with armed security.

Same Democrats are protected by armed guards daily."
RepMTG,"I agree completely about foreign citizens staying home! That‚Äôs why I have an immigration moratorium in my border bill. We finally agree on something, David. üéâ https://t.co/49e9RPkxYT"
RepMTG,"8. the truth people are embracing is that the government is not your keeper nor savior.

It is not your god.

As a matter of fact, the government &amp; most of it‚Äôs leaders have become the cause of most of our shared problems."
RepMTG,"7. The empty promises from the Democrats are not nearly as pretty &amp; shiny as they once were.

A lot of black Americans, not all, but a lot are seeing clearly through the lies &amp; want another way of doing things.

But it‚Äôs not just black Americans, it‚Äôs MANY Americans.

And.."
RepMTG,"6. that Democrats and BLM fundraisers claimed they cared about.

Nope.

Again it was just another lie to manipulate many black Americans and use them for politics.

Now under full Democrat control, America is rapidly declining."
RepMTG,"5. but the only thing BLM did for them was create domestic terrorism in their city streets  and burned down their vulnerable communities.

And then BLM &amp; the Democrats walked away.

The millions and millions of Democrat raised ‚ÄúBLM‚Äù money was never spent to help the black lives"
RepMTG,"4. tell them that the ‚Äúracists‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù Republicans won‚Äôt ‚Äútake care‚Äù of them and that they will lose all they achieved if Republicans take control.

More shameful hideous lies.

Remember, it‚Äôs the Democrats that said Black Lives Matter and raised millions on their skin color,"
RepMTG,"3. Democrats buy their votes by promising government ‚Äúassistance‚Äù and telling them they can‚Äôt achieve without the governments all consuming ‚Äúcare‚Äù which has tragically led many to believe they can‚Äôt even survive without government ‚Äúassistance‚Äù which is a shameful lie.

Then they"
RepMTG,"2. have led many to a culture of destruction. 

Leading them into generational welfare did not produce equality.

Instead it ripped their families apart, filled their communities with unwanted violence, and taught them to kill their own children through abortion, gangs, &amp; drugs."
RepMTG,"1. Many black Americans have been abused &amp; used as pawns by politicians &amp; many leaders for decades.

Used also by some coaches, team owners, ‚Äúeducation‚Äù elites, and even church leaders who all misled them to fatten their wallets &amp; bellies.

Their silver tongues and empty promises"
RepMTG,"The temperature of the country is rapidly changing. 

Most of our leaders aren‚Äôt aware of the huge shift that is happening.

There is a break through coming soon and many people are going to refuse to be silent anymore.

It will shock our controlling elite when they lose control."
RepMTG,https://t.co/f4gKTTdc1L
RepMTG,"3. Our nation only provides a fraction of rare earth minerals for battery &amp; chip production needed right now.

Between high inflation, crime &amp; extreme border dangers, Dems failed economic strategy, and impending doom from the insane Green New Deal agenda, we won‚Äôt survive."
RepMTG,"2. Food security is national security and our farmers cannot produce without affordable oil &amp; gas.

Our nation‚Äôs electricity needs cannot be met without affordable oil &amp; gas, coal, and nuclear energy."
RepMTG,"1. Democrat‚Äôs blind commitment to unsustainable ‚Äúgreen energy‚Äù is going to destroy America.

Wind &amp; solar cannot provide America‚Äôs energy needs.

Without strong oil &amp; natural gas energy independence, our nation is literally being driven into a future of darkness and death."
RepMTG,"Only one day each year, we honor military members who died serving our country for ALL of us to be free.

An entire #PrideMonth and millions in spending through corporations &amp; our government on LGBTQ sexual identity needs to end.

The movements goals were achieved, were they not?"
RepMTG,"The Russian collusion hoax was a coup.

Many were involved.
Are involved.
Still covering it up.

To be taken seriously, Republicans have to bring justice and gut the government of criminals in order to restore the peoples trust in our institutions bc most have lost faith."
