RepGaramendi,"Today I looked out on a field filled with 45,000 roses — one for each life extinguished by a gun last year — and I was overcome with grief. We must make a change. In the words of @GabbyGiffords, we must “fight, fight, fight!” for common sense gun reforms https://t.co/d2XDiZSIdk"
RepGaramendi,"Let me be clear: the safety of our schools, grocery stores, and houses of worship is more important than pest control. Why don’t you find a way to control your prairie dog situation that doesn’t put our kids at risk? https://t.co/WIZus0hl7H"
RepGaramendi,"Republicans are hoping that you and I let Uvalde become just another mass shooting. We won’t allow that. That’s why this week I will vote for:
• A ban on bump stocks
• Bans on high capacity magazines
• Raising the age of gun purchases to 21
• Red flag purchase restrictions"
RepGaramendi,"As we commemorate their work let us continue to fight their fight — the fight to repudiate authoritarianism, white nationalism, and nazism at every turn."
RepGaramendi,"78 years ago, the bravest men in the US military risked life and limb to storm the beaches of Normandy, freeing Europe from Nazi oppression. Today we recognize their contributions to freedom and democracy along with their role in ending the genocidal regime of the Third Reich. https://t.co/fNO6ypFJ0f"
RepGaramendi,Gun reforms are exceedingly popular — yet a small clique of radical politicians funded by the gun lobby prevents their passing at every turn. It’s time for that to change. https://t.co/dMyrIvSJaY
RepGaramendi,I’m choosing our children and a safe future over the radical NRA agenda. That’s why next week I will vote for common-sense gun reforms and continue my decades-long efforts to prevent mass shootings. #EndGunViolence https://t.co/oGc8wWFZFR
RepGaramendi,"The simple answer is the correct one, Congress needs to pass an assault weapons ban. We saw a dramatic decrease in mass shootings we had a federal assault weapons ban from 1994-2004, and we will see another decrease in shootings if we reinstate it today."
RepGaramendi,"The gunman purchased his rifle that same day, and had purchased a handgun four days ago. If he had faced any restriction on that purchase four Americans could still be with us today. Instead, he walked into a gun store and walked with the ability to carry out a mass shooting."
RepGaramendi,"Yesterday a lone gunman walked up to a hospital in Tulsa Oklahoma and opened fire. At least four people lost their lives, several others suffered physical injuries, and an untold number will have lasting psychological damage for years to come."
RepGaramendi,Let’s dispense with the lies. Republicans only talk about mental healthcare when it’s time to protect the NRA. They only want to address mental health as a deflection from common-sense gun reform. We need to get assault weapons off our streets and fund mental health treatment. https://t.co/ZrvPjJ0Kyy
RepGaramendi,Happy Pride Month! Let’s celebrate the LGBTQ+ community and the progress we have made towards LGBTQ+ equality while reaffirming our support for LGBTQ+ individuals and our commitment to uplifting their voices across the country. #PrideMonth https://t.co/eG13olrfph
