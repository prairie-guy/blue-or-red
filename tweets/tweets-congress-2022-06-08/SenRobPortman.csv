SenRobPortman,"Instead of pursuing more reckless taxing and spending that will make inflation worse, the Biden admin should expand American energy production to help address rising energy costs."
SenRobPortman,Working Americans can’t afford gas or food and their wages aren’t keeping up with skyrocketing inflation.
SenRobPortman,"Today, gas prices reached $4.95 a gallon. An increase of more than 100% from the week @POTUS took office.  The Biden administration’s decisions to stifle domestic energy production is in part responsible for these record-high prices."
SenRobPortman,I am especially proud of Ohioans who have chosen to step up and support #Ukraine in its time of need. #Ukrainians are putting up fierce resistance and the United States must not let up in its support for the #Ukrainian people at this critical time. https://t.co/ZLn56qlTNy
SenRobPortman,I urged the Biden admin to go further in their efforts to sanction Russia and assist our European allies by encouraging domestic oil and gas production here in the U.S.
SenRobPortman,"I am pleased that the EU announced its partial ban on Russian oil, but am hopeful that this will lead to a full embargo on all Russian energy."
SenRobPortman,"However, I am concerned that this assistance was delayed too long and is not large enough to meet Ukraine’s current battlefield needs. Last week, I saw firsthand the devastating effects of the war in #Ukraine when I visited eastern Europe and met with #Ukrainian military leaders."
SenRobPortman,"This afternoon, I spoke on the Senate floor for the 14th consecutive session week to discuss the bloody, unprovoked invasion of #Ukraine. I am encouraged that the administration has finally agreed to send High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems to #Ukraine."
SenRobPortman,"The facts are that Israel is a prosperous and democratic country which respects the rights of all people. It is the terrorists in Gaza and the unproductive leaders of the West Bank that are the greatest impediments to peace, not Israel."
SenRobPortman,"The report reinforces previous biased UN reports on the conflict, whitewashes Palestinian terrorism, and places blame for the current conflict on Israelis."
SenRobPortman,This report by the @UN_HRC ‘s Commission of Inquiry is simply yet another baseless attack by the UN against the legitimacy of our ally Israel.
SenRobPortman,"78 years later, we honor the remarkable courage of those who gave their lives for freedom and changed the course of our nation’s history. https://t.co/y6zzsxGXfF"
SenRobPortman,"I also discussed the World War II Memorial Prayer Act I introduced in 2014 with former Senator Mary Landrieu and Representative Bill Johnson which places a plaque  near the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. to commemorate FDR’s prayer."
SenRobPortman,"Today, on one of America’s most somber days, I had the honor of reading President Franklin Roosevelt’s D-Day prayer on the Senate floor to thank and honor the veterans whose bravery and sacrifice turned the tide of WWII."
SenRobPortman,"This afternoon, I joined FOX Business’ Kudlow to discuss the positive impacts of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, energy policy, and the Biden admin’s announcement on China’s solar panel tariffs. Check out the interview here ⤵️ https://t.co/2Je8nMVRZx"
SenRobPortman,"The admin’s announcement that it plans to waive tariffs on solar panel imports from China is the wrong policy at the wrong time. This rewards the CCP for their unfair trade practices, doesn't hold them accountable for their human rights abuses, and will not spur economic growth."
SenRobPortman,"Against immense odds, they secured a beachhead that eventually drove into the heart of Nazi Germany and liberated Europe from Nazi tyranny. For this, they became known as America’s Greatest Generation."
SenRobPortman,"Today is the 78th anniversary of D-Day, when 160k Allied troops stormed the beaches of Normandy and signaled a turning point in WWII."
SenRobPortman,"If Russia continues to advance, more and more #Ukrainian civilian and military lives will be lost."
SenRobPortman,"Sadly, the delay has cost #Ukraine dearly in lives and territory. Although the #Ukrainians are fighting bravely in the east, they are outgunned by the Russians. The U.S. and allies must speed up delivery of this critical support for #Ukraine."
SenRobPortman,"Now let’s speed these needed weapons to the frontlines, approve more than the reported four systems and urge our allies to follow suit to give #Ukrainians a fighting chance."
SenRobPortman,I am glad that the administration has finally decided to provide longer range rocket artillery systems to #Ukraine to try to level the battlefield with Russia’s longer range weapons.
SenRobPortman,"This combination of rising prices, wages not keeping up and higher interest rates is what could put us into a recession if we don’t work together to promote common sense, pro-growth economic policies that were working before the pandemic."
SenRobPortman,"To make matters worse, Americans’ paychecks are not keeping up with the price hikes, which means families will continue to take pay cuts month after month."
SenRobPortman,The Biden admin continues to burden American consumers with 40-year inflation highs. The latest @USCBO report projects the consumer price index to rise 6.1% this year.
SenRobPortman,I urge the Biden admin to promote all-of-the-above American energy production to provide relief for Americans. We must take tangible steps to lower energy costs by working together to find a bipartisan solution.
SenRobPortman,That certainly hasn’t helped but most of the gas price increase happened before the invasion and is the result of deliberate policies to stifle American oil and gas production.
SenRobPortman,"As summer arrives, Americans are paying record high prices for gas with no relief in sight. Since @POTUS took office, gas prices have DOUBLED. It is just not accurate to say this is the result of Russia‘s war on #Ukraine."
SenRobPortman,"With Russia’s incremental gains in the eastern part of the country, more needs to be done quickly before more ground is yielded to Putin’s war machine."
SenRobPortman,"While I am glad the admin is sending longer range artillery (HIMARS) to #Ukraine, only sending four systems is inadequate for their needs, and I am afraid that by the time they are in place it will be too late for many Ukrainian soldiers and civilians."
SenRobPortman,"Instead of more stimulus spending and then relying on the Fed to reduce demand by increasing interest rates, it is time for Democrats to work with Republicans on pro-growth policies that will expand supply and get inflation under control."
SenRobPortman,"This has caused the worst inflation in 40 years. Families deserve pro-growth policies that create American #jobs without high inflation, not the reckless spending that Democrats want to continue."
SenRobPortman,This lead to high demand at a time of constricted supply due to COVID and the Russian war in #Ukraine but also regulations on energy and other sectors.
SenRobPortman,"According to the @USCBO, inflation will continue to skyrocket through the end of this year. American families are experiencing the results of irresponsible stimulus spending that the Biden Admin pushed thru on a partisan basis."
SenRobPortman,It is a true Ohio treasure and under Thane Maynard’s leadership has become global leader in conservation and education. https://t.co/VH24s3pCJj
SenRobPortman,"Congratulations to @CincinnatiZoo for being named best zoo in the country for the second year in a row! If you haven’t gone recently, go check it out. It is better than ever."
SenRobPortman,The U.S. must continue to send more of these systems immediately to help #Ukraine fight off Russia’s onslaught.
SenRobPortman,"While the Admin’s decision to send four advanced rocket artillery systems to #Ukraine is a welcome step, this is too little, too late. This should have been done weeks ago."
SenRobPortman,Today marks 100th day since Russia’s brutal and unwarranted attack on #Ukraine. There is much more to be done and the U.S. and its allies must not let up in our support for the #Ukrainian people.
SenRobPortman,"Today, @Ford announced plans to add more than 6,200 new U.S. manufacturing jobs across the Midwest. #Ohio will receive a total of $1.6 billion in investments and 1,890 new #jobs. Great news for the Buckeye state! https://t.co/zSPbtTTLT4"
SenRobPortman,These new rocket artillery systems must now be put in service without delay and in large enough numbers to actually make a difference on the battlefield.
SenRobPortman,"Brave Ukrainian soldiers and non-combatant civilians are being killed every day by the Russian invasion. In order to stop the deadly assault and turn the tide in favor of Ukrainians, the Admin must respond more quickly to the needs on the battlefield."
SenRobPortman,"This is good news, and something I have been calling for, but it took too long and I fear that by the time the systems are operational Ukraine will have lost more soldiers and more land in the fierce fighting in the eastern part of the country."
SenRobPortman,"Today, the administration formally notified Congress that it will provide Ukraine with rocket artillery systems they need to respond to Russian attacks."
