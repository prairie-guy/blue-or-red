Rep_SteveWomack,"Lewis Wray of Russellville was recently inducted into the National Cutting Horse Hall of Fame! A great achievement. The tribute honors his contributions to the sport, but I'll always remember him as my Backfield Coach at @RHS_cyclones. From all us old Cyclones, ""Congrats, Emma!"""
Rep_SteveWomack,"Known terrorists are coming across the U.S.-Mexico border.
