RepRoybalAllard,"Happy Birthday @SenatorLujan!

I am thankful for your friendship. I wish you peace, health and happiness in all the wonderful days to come. https://t.co/3ldaKd68qL"
RepRoybalAllard,"WE HAVE A GUN EPIDEMIC. 

How much time could my colleagues in the Senate need?

@HouseDemocrats passed the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act TWO WEEKS AGO. 

This week, we will pass a red flag law and increase the legal age to buy a gun. 

Get these bills to @POTUS’ desk, NOW. https://t.co/Q2EJNZpKrP"
RepRoybalAllard,"Your mother, Ruth Whitfield, will always matter, Mr. Whitfield. And she should still be here with us today. 

My colleagues in the Senate have a duty to find the courage and pass the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, now.

RepRoybalAllard,"Apoyo aumentar la edad para comprar armas de fuego de 18 a 21 años. Nuestros hijos merecen saber que no permitiremos que sus compañeros compren armas de fuego. Recientemente aumentamos la edad legal para comprar cigarrillos de 18 a 21 años.

Haremos esto.
https://t.co/4qrqo8ptvY"
RepRoybalAllard,"I support increasing the age to purchase firearms from 18 to 21. Our children deserve to know that we will not allow their classmates to purchase firearms. We recently increased the legal age to purchase cigarettes from 18 to 21.

We will get this done.

RepRoybalAllard,"The @POTUS knows our economy still faces challenges. 
That's why bringing down prices is one of his top priorities. The Administration continues to take every action it can to lower prices. 

The President's plan will get this done."
RepRoybalAllard,"The #BidenEconomy added 390,000 jobs in May. 

This was the result of the @POTUS' economic vision to grow our economy from the middle out. He powered us back to recovery with his Rescue Plan, which has spurred a historically fast recovery."
RepRoybalAllard,"Gun violence deaths SHOULD NOT be the leading cause of death for our children. 

But it is. 

And it’s SHAMEFUL. 

We owe it to the children who’ve already lost their lives to pass commonsense gun reform laws, now.

#GunViolenceAwarenessDay https://t.co/CygKwVeWQH"
RepRoybalAllard,"@HouseDemocrats will pass commonsense gun reforms next week. 

The Senate must find the courage to do its job by joining us."
RepRoybalAllard,"It is the shame of our nation that gun reform laws have yet to pass through the Senate. 

This time MUST be different. 

For if its not, the status quo will become normal. We cannot afford for that to happen.

RepRoybalAllard,"On this 8th #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, I ask my colleagues sitting idly on the fence of passing meaningful gun reform laws to re-evaluate their conscience and moral obligation to act.

Republican colleagues, we took an oath. 

The buck stops with us to fix it."
RepRoybalAllard,"Just look at these numbers! 

President Biden’s economy added 390K jobs in May! 

The @potus is getting Americans back to work safely and our economy is building back stronger and better each day.

This moment calls for courage from my Republican colleagues.

There are broken hearts all over this country tonight.

The House will get the “Protecting our Kids Act” to the Senate. The Senate has an obligation to finish the job and get the bill to the President Biden’s desk. https://t.co/eJbPAorRln"
RepRoybalAllard,"@POTUS is right. The violence across our nation MUST end. We can ban assault weapons. It takes one action in the House and one action in the Senate. And it takes one signature from @POTUS to stop the sale of these weapons. 

Let’s band together &amp; save lives. 
Let’s get this done. https://t.co/rJhJlcDc8r"

RepRoybalAllard,"Don’t tell me it’s not the guns. 

IT’S THE GUNS. 

We have a gun epidemic, America. 

And we must band together to ban assault rifles now. https://t.co/r4R5PK8ScR"

I’m thinking of the families rocked by the #Tulsa shooting. Their loved ones killings occurred on the same day that two funerals were held for children killed in #Uvalde. When will our “hearts break for you”  turn into action? Families don’t deserve excuses, they need action."
RepRoybalAllard,"1/2

Until we find the courage to ban assault rifles, these shootings will continue to claim the lives of our fellow Americans in every corner of our nation. We ought to be ashamed of the continued inaction on commonsense gun reforms.

@HouseDemocrats will deliver it to the Senate. 

The Senate can pass it if they place more value on the lives of precious children, and our fellow Americans, over the campaign dollars provided by the NRA and gun manufactures.

As their families put them to rest and say goodbye, I urge my colleagues in Congress who continue to sit idle on the fence over the urgency to pass meaningful and commonsense gun reforms to ACT.
