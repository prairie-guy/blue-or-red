SenFeinstein,I met with representatives today from @AMarch4OurLives to talk about our desperate need for gun safety reform. We need to bring sanity back to our nation’s gun laws. Commonsense proposals like the Age 21 Act are a good starting point. https://t.co/Pbc9MAIDSr
SenFeinstein,"The Age 21 Act is a commonsense bill that has had bipartisan support in the past. Read my op-ed in the Los Angeles Times on the need to pass it:

SenFeinstein,"The shooters in Buffalo and Uvalde were both only 18, but they were able to legally purchase the AR-15s they used to murder dozens of people. Had this legislation been enacted, it could have prevented both massacres."
SenFeinstein,"After a teenage gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, I joined Republican Senator Jeff Flake on a bill to raise the age to purchase assault weapons to 21. I reintroduced that bill last month."
SenFeinstein,"The 2022 Agriculture Census is underway. It’s important for all California farmers to participate so our state’s farmers and ranchers get the resources they need. The last day to sign up is June 30. Find more info here:

SenFeinstein,"Bold leadership is necessary to combat climate change. California is on the forefront of this transition and President Biden's actions to bolster solar energy will help us reach a zero-emissions economy, reducing prices for consumers and lowering harmful carbon emissions. https://t.co/H8ovkO8z9r"
SenFeinstein,"If you can’t buy a six pack of beer or a pack of cigarettes, you shouldn’t be able to buy an assault weapon. It’s long past time that Congress addresses this incongruence. Read my op-ed on why we must pass the Age 21 Act:

SenFeinstein,"These horrific tragedies have two things in common: teenage suspects were able to legally purchase AR-15-style assault weapons, and the shooters used such guns to kill as many people as possible, as quickly as possible."
SenFeinstein,"A gunman entered a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y., last month and fatally shot 10 people. Just 10 days later, a gunman entered an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and killed 19 students and two teachers."
SenFeinstein,The risk of wildfire will only continue to grow as the temperature rises this summer. Clearing flammable materials from around your home can help prevent fire from damaging your home.

SenFeinstein,"On #NationalCancerSurvivorsDay we recognize the tribulations and perseverance of those battling this disease. I’m grateful for projects like President Biden’s Cancer Moonshot, which will lead to more and more Americans surviving cancer and living long, fulfilling lives."
SenFeinstein,"On this #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay, I’m more committed than ever to seeing commonsense gun safety legislation get enacted. From reinstating the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban (which 10 Republicans voted for) to implementing red-flag laws and more, there’s much work to be done."
SenFeinstein,"Today we #WearOrange to remember the countless lives lost to gun violence in the United States. As we’ve been reminded recently, gun violence is a scourge on American society that must be addressed."
SenFeinstein,The fact that the Tulsa shooter was able to purchase an AR-15-style rifle yesterday afternoon and then use it to murder four people a few hours later underscores how deeply broken our nation’s gun safety and background check laws are. Something must change.
SenFeinstein,"California voters passed Prop 12 in 2018 to set humane standards for farm animal products sold in the state. A lawsuit seeking to invalidate it could let large, multistate companies evade state laws designed to protect the health and safety of constituents. That can’t happen. https://t.co/b1snw2unVG"
SenFeinstein,"More and more mass shootings are being committed by gunmen 21 or younger. It's far too easy to buy guns in this country, especially assault rifles. There's just no reason an 18-year-old should be able to buy an AR-15. Congress must close this loophole.

https://t.co/YIoXFT2Nmi"
SenFeinstein,"We know how to stop gun violence. In the 10 years that the Assault Weapons Ban was in place, gun massacres dropped 37 percent. After the ban lapsed in 2004, gun massacres rose by 183 percent. We have to act or more and more people will continue to die."
SenFeinstein,I’m grateful for the administration awarding more than $7.6 million to California businesses to spur innovative timber projects aimed to improve forest health and resilience and reduce wildfire risk. Congress needs to pass my bill to increase facilities capable of this work. https://t.co/u6PX1pwjNa
SenFeinstein,"Wishing everyone a safe and happy #Pride! During Pride Month, let’s celebrate the great progress made in the fight for equality since Stonewall, but also recognize that the fight for equality doesn’t stop. https://t.co/eNMAi8Asc2"
