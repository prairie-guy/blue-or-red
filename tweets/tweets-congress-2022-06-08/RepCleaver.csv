RepCleaver,"One way or another, we’re going to pay for #ClimateChange.
 
We’ve been doing it for decades.
 
Let’s make long overdue investments to accelerate our transition to renewable energy—which will create good-paying jobs, #ActOnClimate, and protect our communities from extreme weather https://t.co/NDOi9NeJLO"
RepCleaver,"If Republican Senators refuse to help, this is the kind of creative idea we need to help protect our kids and get weapons of war off the street.

RepCleaver,"We cannot accept inaction as America’s epidemic of gun violence continues to steal the lives of loved ones in communities across the country.

@HouseDemocrats and I will be voting for just that this week. https://t.co/S3Q731hTwF"

RepCleaver,"I want to say thank you to those in #MO05 for participating in my tele-town hall last night &amp; for engaging in such thoughtful &amp; critical discussion around this pressing matter. 

Many of the concerns voiced closely aligned with the steps @POTUS proposed in last night’s address. https://t.co/WcKmUxhqSl"
RepCleaver,"Research shows that if we still had a federal Assault Weapon Ban, we’d see 70% fewer mass shooting deaths. Thankful to see @POTUS take a firm stance against these weapons of war.
 
The data speaks for itself. Congress must act to protect Americans from what we know is preventable https://t.co/qDnTCCyt7Z"

RepCleaver,"The #AmericanRescuePlan provided historic investments to support public health initiatives in states across the country.
 
While I continue fighting for additional investments in public health in Congress, Missouri should allocate more funding to support moms across the state."
RepCleaver,"Every Missourian deserves peace of mind in knowing they’re getting quality, expert prenatal care. Sadly, nearly 25% of infants in Missouri were born to women receiving less than adequate care.
 
We can, and must, do better."
RepCleaver,"Missouri currently ranks 44th in the nation in maternal mortality rate—and it’s because our state ranks in the bottom 10% of public health funding per capita, leaving nearly half the counties in our state classified as maternity care deserts."
RepCleaver,"Yesterday, I hosted a sobering, critically important roundtable discussion on maternal mortality in MO.
 
Thank you to the physicians &amp; individuals from @saintlukeskc, @UHKCMO, @HealthyLivingMO, @NurtureKC, &amp; @MarchofDimes for shedding light on the importance of maternal health. https://t.co/BgK51hgqM0"
