RepMaxineWaters,The Summit of the Americas is being held in Los Angeles. Is it going to be pomp and circumstance? Or a real effort to solve the problems of our region? China is watching.
RepMaxineWaters,I am having sleepless nights as I continue to get images in my head about innocent people and children being shot or killed in cold blood. I am begging any and all Members of Congress who are NRA supporters to please have a heart and support our gun control bills.
RepMaxineWaters,"I take great pride in celebrating #PrideMonth. As a board member of Equality PAC, the political arm of the Congressional LGBTQ Equality Caucus, and my long career of advocating for equal rights for the LGBTQ community, as I do every year, I will be marching in Pride!"
