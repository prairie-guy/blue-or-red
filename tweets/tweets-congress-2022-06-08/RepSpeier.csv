RepSpeier,We just boycotted the moment of silence on the House floor. No more moments of silence without REAL action. https://t.co/RCPswBm1iT
RepSpeier,"UPDATE: Due to late votes in the House this week, I am postponing my tele town hall to next week. Stay tuned for more details coming soon!"
RepSpeier,44% of Republicans think we just have to live with mass shootings! Bring the babies into the world and let them get slaughtered? Not on my watch.
RepSpeier,"As the daughter of an immigrant, I know immigration fulfills dreams, increases our nationâ€™s vibrancy &amp; builds a stronger America. Letâ€™s stand united during Immigrant Heritage Month &amp; #CelebrateImmigrants of all origins in the Bay Area &amp; across the country. https://t.co/f0KnncRdbs"
RepSpeier,"WEDNESDAY at 5:30 pm PT,Â  join me for a tele town hall for my constituents in Redwood City &amp; Daly City on Americaâ€™s gun violence epidemic. I will be joined by the founder of Moms Demand Action, Shannon Watts &amp; UC Davisâ€™s Dr. Garen Wintemute! Sign up here: https://t.co/1qkhHDFdpU"
RepSpeier,Three years ago at Normandy I visited the grave of a friend's father. Such sacred ground. Such courage. America at her finest hour. Still sends shivers down my spine. https://t.co/q0FBTf6hm4
RepSpeier,The fall of Roe also threatens military readiness &amp; morale. Our women servicemembers are willing to die for our country. They deserve access to basic health care that 1-in-4 American women receive! My bill will guarantee they can get abortion care on base https://t.co/8sssJPBQJf
RepSpeier,"End gun violence, no more silence! #wearorange https://t.co/L5xKOvY8HI"
RepSpeier,"Thatâ€™s a recipe for disaster not just for servicemembers &amp; their families, but for military readiness &amp; morale. Iâ€™m introducing the MARCH for Servicemembers Act w/ 80+ of my colleagues to provide abortion services on base &amp; to cover the costs! ðŸ‘‡https://t.co/qdY81irLzq"
RepSpeier,Abortion will be illegal in 26 states if Roe is overturned. The fallout will be catastrophic for women servicemembers whose unintended pregnancy rate is 22% higher than civilians. Taking time to go off-base or out of state &amp; paying out of pocket is a luxury many canâ€™t afford. https://t.co/YIdCjd84Aa
RepSpeier,"Think about it: If a plane crashed every day w/ 110 people on it, Congress would be outraged. It would act immediately to prevent more deaths. Yet everyday, 110 people die from gun violence &amp; NOTHING changes. Instead, shootings occur day after day after day. This is NOT normal."
RepSpeier,Call it for what it is. The US Congressâ€™ willingness to do nothing is ABNORMAL. The US massacre of children &amp; churchgoers &amp; now outpatients in Tulsa happens NOWHERE else on this planet but here. We must demand the Senate act or lose their jobs. Time to do a sit-in in the Senate.

RepSpeier,"Time for the @NFL &amp; @Commanders to come clean. What defense could they have for the extensive accounts of lewd, discriminatory behavior &amp; harassment? I look forward to questioning Snyder &amp; Goodell. Itâ€™s time to shine a light on this cesspool that passes for a pro sports org. https://t.co/RV3nEDkqj6"
RepSpeier,"Calls from Rs to harden schools &amp; make children attend glorified penitentiaries wonâ€™t work. But itâ€™ll keep gun lobby $ flowing. Robb Elementary had a police officer assigned to it, so did Marjory Stoneman Douglas. The problem is easy access to weapons that kill on a mass scale."
