RepSwalwell,"At a gun safety hearing I asked my GOP colleagues if they were “for our kids or for their killers?” 

Then my office got this voicemail. The caller wants to stop our efforts to protect kids. He’s won’t. But he does prove why we should know more about someone before they own a gun https://t.co/aiUpMoxzXv"
RepSwalwell,"Proud of my friend, retired Officer Mike Fanone — an ar-15 owner — for coming out against assault weapons. #BanAssaultWeaponsNow https://t.co/LIL56YRIg6"
RepSwalwell,And then you told Eve that you **not she** will make decisions about her body. https://t.co/zNAgCKnFdr
RepSwalwell,“Stopping things before they happen” you say? What if—and hear me out—we had a way for people to call the police if they fear an unstable person with a weapon of mass destruction is about to shoot up a school? Like if they see a red flag? Then the police stop it? Good with that? https://t.co/kfzTc6waxt
RepSwalwell,"As we mark Gun Violence Awareness Day, I'm taking a moment to remember those we have lost to the epidemic of gun violence in America. It’s time to take action to #EndGunViolence. Inaction is NOT an option. https://t.co/nIxqTPPlzg"
RepSwalwell,Oh—Why didn’t y’all just say so? We have to protect the chickens from the raccoons. Cool cool. So that’s why our kids have to die in their classrooms. So we can protect the chickens. Makes total sense now. https://t.co/ir21XalETg
RepSwalwell,"We are voting to protect kids from the next school shooting. Every GOP member is opposed. So I asked my GOP colleagues, ""Who are you here for? Our kids or the killers."" https://t.co/U2oitLQcxa"
RepSwalwell,This is who Republicans are. Kids are being buried and they’re bragging about how many guns they own during our gun safety hearing. They are not serious. They are a danger to our kids. https://t.co/3A6H62Wol7
RepSwalwell,"Shortly I will be speaking in @HouseJudiciary
in support of a package of bills to reduce the persistent gun violence that has torn apart families and communities.

Inaction is not an option.

Watch here: https://t.co/27nC6TCHJm"
RepSwalwell,What a concept. God bless those brave officers of Tulsa. https://t.co/tWcdYujju3
RepSwalwell,"We are in a @HouseJudiciary hearing to pass the Protecting Our Kids Act, and @JudiciaryGOP have already invoked Hunter Biden. Republicans are not serious about protecting our kids. We are getting shit done here. What’s your job, @HouseGOP?"
RepSwalwell,Great idea! @DemsOfState are the guardians of our democracy! https://t.co/g7HcYZd0Z8
RepSwalwell,Only action. That’s the only way to save our kids. Thank you @Eleven_Films for never giving up on our ability to change this country. https://t.co/m4KYvPZEQT
RepSwalwell,What is wrong with gay people? https://t.co/CBOBRMpsiY
