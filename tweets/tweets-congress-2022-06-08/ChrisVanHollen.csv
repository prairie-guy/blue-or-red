ChrisVanHollen,"We have a responsibility to ensure our nation’s veterans receive the care they deserve. W/ these 9 bipartisan bills that @POTUS just signed into law, we can improve veterans’ health services–from expanding access to mammograms to benefits for veterans exposed to radiation in WWII https://t.co/5vbC5L4XRT"
ChrisVanHollen,"#OTD in 1965 SCOTUS ruled in #GriswoldvConnecticut, securing the right to marital privacy in using birth control. As Roe V. Wade hangs in the balance, we must protect reproductive health care–which is why I’m supporting the reintroduction of the #AffordabilityIsAccess Act today."
ChrisVanHollen,I stand w/ @StudentsDemand as they rally today for comprehensive common-sense gun safety reforms. Our children shouldn't live in fear of going to school or walking down their street.

ChrisVanHollen,"Renewable energy, like solar, is key to a clean energy future. That’s why I’ve urged the Admin to break through the supply bottleneck that’s hampering growth &amp; investment in solar right now, incl. suspending tariffs that ⬆️ $ of solar panels. Glad to see @POTUS took this action. https://t.co/FwxiHiURHL"
ChrisVanHollen,"78 years ago today, with bravery &amp; unwavering resolve, heroes who served our nation stormed the Normandy beaches. Their courage determined the future of peace &amp; freedom globally. We must never forget their courage and sacrifice. https://t.co/1F8YfjBFdG"

ChrisVanHollen,"#OTD 103 years ago the Senate passed the 19th Amdt, initiating the process to give women the right to vote. Today, many states impede the right to vote by erecting barriers to the ballot box. We must keep pushing to pass the Freedom to Vote Act &amp; the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. https://t.co/6ZtDnzNRBH"
ChrisVanHollen,"Maryland is lucky to have great trails across our state &amp; many right in our backyards! I hope you’re able to celebrate #NationalTrailsDay today by exploring one &amp; I’ll keep fighting in Congress to maintain our trails, like our recent work to secure $$ for @GarrettTrails. https://t.co/br5asAWfMc"
ChrisVanHollen,"Today’s jobs report makes clear that our economic recovery remains on track. But we’ve got more work to do to tackle rising costs folks face due to the 4 P’s: Putin, the Pandemic, Price gouging, &amp; Politics — like GOP obstruction on efforts to cut costs of RX drugs &amp; child care. https://t.co/zOvkGELlrb"
ChrisVanHollen,"From Buffalo to Uvalde to the daily toll of gun violence in our neighborhoods, across our nation communities have been left devastated. On this #GunViolenceAwarnessDay we must not only honor the memories of those lost to gun violence but commit to action. https://t.co/Y712HDkB3n"
ChrisVanHollen,A healthy Bay is vital not only to the success of MD but to our entire region. We’ve got to do all we can to protect it—that’s why we’re continuing our successful efforts to secure the federal $ needed to improve its health and preserve it—for today and for generations to come. https://t.co/Blg99Pso2S
ChrisVanHollen,.@POTUS &amp; @USEDGOV’s actions will help thousands of Americans who were cheated by a for-profit college that's now gone bankrupt. This provides impt relief but we must tackle the #StudentLoan crisis &amp; make college more affordable so we can provide relief from heavy student debt. https://t.co/BLw43tL21Z
ChrisVanHollen,For many young ppl internships are a doorway to a career. But when internships are unpaid that door remains closed to many. To ensure greater equity &amp; diversity in hiring we’ve got to ensure the same in internships. That’s why I fought for paid internships on the Hill &amp; in the WH https://t.co/HD5fF4Uhns
ChrisVanHollen,"All Americans deserve access to high-quality, affordable health care. But for many who are already eligible for free or low-cost plans, enrollment barriers stand in their way. As this new report makes clear, my Easy Enrollment bill will help close the access gap &amp; increase equity https://t.co/lhVm97Waw1"
ChrisVanHollen,"Bottom line is that we have to get baby formula back on America’s shelves NOW. This is an important step by @POTUS, but we need answers on how this happened and how to make sure it never happens again, including taking a close look at the few producers dominating the US market. https://t.co/UHZVuP972s"

ChrisVanHollen,"Supporting the Ukrainian people as they bravely defend their sovereignty isn’t just the right thing to do, as @POTUS said, it’s also vital to the survival &amp; success of democracies elsewhere. We must continue our efforts to cut off the cash Putin uses to fund his shameful war. https://t.co/JQ7UNfV9H3"
ChrisVanHollen,"We cannot &amp; will not accept senseless gun violence as normal. The crackdown on ghost guns here in MD is a step fwd, but our state is not an island. As @MayorBMScott takes on manufacturers &amp; our new law goes into effect, I’ll keep fighting for federal, common-sense gun safety laws https://t.co/yijOBh1j3f"
ChrisVanHollen,"Happy #PrideMonth! Our country was founded on the ideals of liberty &amp; justice for all. But today, many LGBTQ+ Americans still do not have equal protection under the law. I’ll never stop fighting to secure equal rights for the LGBTQ+ community through bills like the Equality Act. https://t.co/6nd9FotD0p"
