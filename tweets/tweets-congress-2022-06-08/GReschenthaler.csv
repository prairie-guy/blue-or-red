GReschenthaler,"The recall of Chesa Boudin shows even bright blue San Francsico understands Democrats' soft-on-crime policies don't work.

‚õΩÔ∏è January 20th, 2021: $2.39 
‚õΩÔ∏è June 7th, 2022: $4.92

This is a direct result of the Biden Administration's failed Green New Deal policies and their war on U.S. energy production."

https://t.co/8AudX5kVOL"
GReschenthaler,"Today, on the 78th anniversary of D-Day, we honor some of our nation‚Äôs most courageous and selfless heroes.

From braving the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc to the concentrated fire on Omaha Beach, Americans led the way in the fight to liberate Europe from Nazi tyranny. https://t.co/Q49wVls0P6"
GReschenthaler,"How many times do the American people have to tell you no until you listen to them?
https://t.co/rtnXM62N4k"
GReschenthaler,"Biden's targeting of gun manufacturers is merely a backdoor attempt to end the Second Amendment.

Democrats are willing to go to any extreme to take your guns away, whether that's attacking private business, removing the filibuster, or packing SCOTUS. https://t.co/7dBI2VLUDD"
GReschenthaler,"And it can‚Äôt come soon enough.

It's disgraceful."
GReschenthaler,"We should be supplying Ukraine with long-range missiles.

And they should be using those missiles to target the Russian batteries slaughtering their civilians.

GReschenthaler,"In February 2021, I urged the U.S. to seek a bilateral trade agreement with Taiwan when I introduced the Taiwan Invasion Prevention Act.

If that's true, why did they cancel massive drilling lease sales in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico last month?"
GReschenthaler,"The EU will ban two-thirds of Russia‚Äôs oil imports immediately and 90% by the end of the year.

‚ùå Silenced doctors who warned about COVID
‚ùå Gave false information to WHO about COVID
‚ùå Obstructed investigations into COVID
‚ùå Imposed draconian lockdowns

WHO has lost all credibility."
GReschenthaler,"Our first responders deserve comprehensive coverage for the physical &amp; mental wounds they suffer while serving our communities.
