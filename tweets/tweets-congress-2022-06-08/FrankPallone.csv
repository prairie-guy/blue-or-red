FrankPallone,"There is no reason for civilians to own weapons of war like the AR-15. The U.S. had an assault weapon ban that worked until it expired in 2004. Ever since then mass shootings have tragically become a regular occurrence.

FrankPallone,"Extreme weather events will only become more frequent if we don’t finally address the rising levels of carbon dioxide. We must begin our transition to clean energy and move forward with the clean energy provisions passed by the House last year.

FrankPallone,"Republicans’ energy and climate “plan” simply recycles old, bad ideas that amount to little more than handouts to oil companies. 

It is a stunning display of insincerity to admit climate change is a problem but to propose policies that make it worse.

FrankPallone,"Gun violence is responsible for over 32,000 deaths every year.
