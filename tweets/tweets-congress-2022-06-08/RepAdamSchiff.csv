RepAdamSchiff,"The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia ordered the brutal murder of an American resident and journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.

For that — and many other human rights violations — he should be shunned.

I would not meet with him or shake his hand.

President Biden shouldn’t either. https://t.co/FSuRT2iK2O"
RepAdamSchiff,"January 6 was the violent culmination of an extensive effort to overturn a presidential election.

The American people know a lot about those events, but soon they will learn more, and see how close we came to losing our democracy.

On Thursday, we will begin to tell that story. https://t.co/hX6RAS9GFR"
RepAdamSchiff,"Prosecution of those who refuse to comply with a lawful subpoena is vital to ensuring congressional oversight has teeth.

Otherwise, Congress cannot function as the Founders intended.

The balance of power becomes unbalanced. And a corrupt executive can’t be held to account."
RepAdamSchiff,".@POTUS' strategy to fight gun violence is spot on.

One of his priorities: Repealing immunity for negligent gun makers and dealers.

That’s a top priority of mine, too.

And I wrote the bill to get it done.

No one gets a pass when it comes to protecting the lives of our kids."
RepAdamSchiff,"Same old excuses from the GOP:

“Criminals will break any gun safety laws we pass.”

Wrong. Gun laws reduce the number of mass killings.

They have in every other country that has tried.

We’re lawmakers. It’s literally in the job title.

If you’re not up to it, find a new job."
RepAdamSchiff,"It just never ends.

And how could we expect it to if we don’t do anything about gun violence.

My heart is with the Tulsa community as it mourns.

But my determination is in Washington where every wasted second means another preventable death.

We must act. Now."
RepAdamSchiff,"Pride is a time to uplift the LGBTQ+ community.

To do so, we must remember its roots.

Because the first Pride wasn’t a celebration – it was a protest led by trans activists like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.

We honor them by standing with the LGBTQ+ community. Always."
