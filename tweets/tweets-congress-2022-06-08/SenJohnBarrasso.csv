SenJohnBarrasso,"The WPLI bill strikes a balance between protecting the wild places that people in Wyoming love, while expanding multiple-use areas that our state and our local economies need. Wyoming, not Washington, should make the decision about how to treat these lands. https://t.co/2IJtOqxaDi"
SenJohnBarrasso,I was pleased to have WCCA Executive Director Jerimiah Rieman testify before the Energy Committee today on the Wyoming Public Lands Initiative. WPLI would resolve the management status of thousands of acres of federal lands in seven Wyoming counties. https://t.co/eW2ITGSMV0 https://t.co/BSFUDxcwNJ
SenJohnBarrasso,".@POTUS is refusing to take the steps needed to lower the cost of gasoline. Instead he has taken an axe to American energy and is chopping into the paychecks of the American people. They don't believe the president anymore, they believe their own two eyes and their empty wallets. https://t.co/6Kev1DOuuj"
SenJohnBarrasso,"After getting it completely wrong on inflation, why should Americans put any confidence in any of Secretary Yellen’s 
pronouncements, decisions, and recommendations? https://t.co/Z8yPY5WJ9p"
SenJohnBarrasso,"Sec. Yellen and @POTUS' solution to high gas prices in America: hike taxes on American oil &amp; gas producers, build solar panels &amp; beg other countries to produce more oil. https://t.co/RfDeLJjDrl"
SenJohnBarrasso,"On this day 78 years ago, thousands of brave allied soldiers landed on the beaches of Normandy. Without their tremendous courage we could’ve seen a very different ending to WWII. #DDay https://t.co/2QO3UtoS5T"
SenJohnBarrasso,Wyoming @girls_state kicked off its 79th session in Cheyenne today. Delegates will explore the principles of democracy and citizenship while learning about our government through this unique experience. Thanks to the WY Legion Auxiliary for hosting these young leaders. https://t.co/w7FiKKzaR2
SenJohnBarrasso,"Raising taxes &amp; spending more taxpayer money is the cornerstone of the Democrats’ economic policy. Reviving a reconciliation package will take us away from the economic sanity we need to bring back to this country, that we lost under this president, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Chuck Schumer. https://t.co/elofCCNDW3"
SenJohnBarrasso,"The president wants the American people to buy electric cars – they are better off buying an electric generator. We need more energy to transmit but @POTUS' attacks and regulations on oil, gas, and coal is making us have less reliable energy across the country. https://t.co/0CMOcGkno6"
SenJohnBarrasso,"The economy is heading worse than it is now because of this administration's unnecessary government spending. Americans can’t afford more taxes when they can’t even afford to put food on the table. Once again, @JoeBiden is too slow to respond to the needs of the American people. https://t.co/WykGx0WiXn"
SenJohnBarrasso,"We need to use the American energy we have in the ground, but @POTUS won’t let us get it out. This is unmistakable evidence that the president is flat out lying to the American people when he says he is “doing everything possible” to lower the cost of energy. https://t.co/EcfjY6xTD0"
SenJohnBarrasso,".@POTUS’ plan to fight inflation is not a plan, it’s an embarrassment. He is beholden to the climate elitists. Raising taxes is the cornerstone of the Democrats’ economic policy and it makes no sense when the American people's wallets are empty and their savings are shrinking. https://t.co/xdQqjvBmJ1"
SenJohnBarrasso,Gas prices have officially doubled since @JoeBiden’s first day in office. Americans can’t afford your incredible “energy transition” @POTUS. It’s time to unleash American energy and lower prices for families who are struggling under #Bidenflation. https://t.co/P2bXnspdQc
SenJohnBarrasso,"Sarah Tallerico, an impressive JH Classical Academy graduate, will continue her path of excellence with her appointment to @WestPoint_USMA. It was an honor to speak at her graduation. Best of luck to Sarah as she pursues her dream of practicing medicine &amp; serving our country. https://t.co/I4hC9oUI5O"
SenJohnBarrasso,"Stopped for lunch at the Red Baron in Afton, WY where family reunions were bringing everyone together. https://t.co/pUvcqQbC2n"
SenJohnBarrasso,"By blocking energy production in Wyoming, @POTUS is killing American jobs, driving up gas prices, and sending an unmistakable signal that the pain for American families will continue. 
https://t.co/9LD8zYpK9w"
SenJohnBarrasso,"Once again the Biden administration has sided with the radical left to block American energy. The result: record high gas prices, less security."
SenJohnBarrasso,"Oil and gas leasing on federal lands is essential to American energy production. @POTUS continues to lie to the American people. His policies are making it harder to produce U.S. energy, increasing prices, and destroying Wyoming jobs.
https://t.co/Qu6aHf4t4r"
SenJohnBarrasso,"People have paid the price all Memorial Day Weekend. We’re at all-time high prices and the question is, who will Americans believe? @JoeBiden talking at them or their own two eyes and their empty wallets. 3/4 of Americans believe the country is heading in the wrong direction. https://t.co/UDTqps7Z1J"
SenJohnBarrasso,WY Ag in the Classroom teachers and supporters ensure that Wyoming’s future generations are educated stewards of our state’s lands and resources. It was wonderful to join their “Wyoming’s Students Wyoming’s Future” Celebration in Casper today. https://t.co/Wy4UMV9k0Y
