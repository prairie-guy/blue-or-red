‚õΩÔ∏è Orange County: $6.37
‚õΩÔ∏è San Bernardino County: $6.26
‚õΩÔ∏è Los Angeles County: $6.40

Cutting off U.S. energy production and buying oil from dictators are not the answer. We must unleash energy dominance!"
RepYoungKim,"The Biden administration is not only cancelling border security projects, but also leaving tools that could support our border patrol instead unused in storage at taxpayers' expense. This makes no sense.

I wrote to @SecMayorkas to demand answers.

RepYoungKim,"Speaker Pelosi's government price controls bill does nothing lower gas prices and relieve pain felt by all Americans at the pump. It's socialism.

RepYoungKim,"With inflation at a 40-year high, Americans are paying more, earning less, &amp; saving less.

RepYoungKim,"Our community simply cannot afford any more pain at the pump.

RepYoungKim,"All kids deserve the opportunity to reach their full potential &amp; achieve their dream. 
Imposing a one-size-fits-all math framework in California schools when only 1/3 of students met math standards puts our kids behind &amp; undermines U.S. competitiveness.
