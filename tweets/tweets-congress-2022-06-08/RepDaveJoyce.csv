RepDaveJoyce,"I‚Äôve lived in Northeast Ohio my entire life - this is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen #gasprices in Orwell surpass $5 a gallon.

That‚Äôsüî∫60% since last June and üî∫129% since @POTUS took office last January. Buckeyes can‚Äôt afford this Administration‚Äôs self-inflicted #EnergyCrisis. https://t.co/Dba8L3MsFg"
RepDaveJoyce,"78 years ago Allied Forces - including 73,000 Americans - stormed the beaches of Normandy to defeat the Nazis and their tyranny. Millions have their freedom today due to the unwavering courage of these soldiers. God bless the Greatest Generation for their service and sacrifice üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/Osv1fpbLAm"
RepDaveJoyce,"To effectively lower #gasprices and provide lasting relief at the pump, @POTUS needs to support domestic #energy production, reduce our dependence on foreign fuel sources, and stimulate economic growth in energy-abundant states like Ohio."
RepDaveJoyce,Ohio's oil and gas industry reduced its carbon emissions by 50 million metric tons each year between 2005 and 2015 - the biggest reduction of any state in the US - contributing to America's largest reduction of emissions in the HISTORY of conventional energy over the past decade.
RepDaveJoyce,"The President needs to reach out to American oil and gas producers here at home to solve our #EnergyCrisis instead of turning to Middle Eastern powers

We should be using American energy to counter foreign regimes, not relying on them for our energy needs https://t.co/MN9H72zUL9"
