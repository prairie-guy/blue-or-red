RepHoulahan,"My daughter is a proud member of the LGTBQ community and will marry her wonderful fiancée this year. The Supreme Court ruled that gay marriage is legal. Still, our nation is embroiled in a divisive reckoning that has translated into alarming, troublesome, and hateful legislation. https://t.co/TrwLay6PcP"
RepHoulahan,"Americans are tired of elected officials legislating on rhetoric instead of reality.

Proud to lead this effort with @RepSpanberger. https://t.co/e5QEJL8DKO"

RepHoulahan,"Too many elected officials want to wait until there’s a week without a mass shooting to have serious conversations about gun violence.

So, in their words, it’s not ‘politicized’

The problem?

There have been 0 weeks this year without a mass shooting.

Now IS the time."
