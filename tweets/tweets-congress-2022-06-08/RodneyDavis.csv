RodneyDavis,"Gas prices in Illinois and across the country are hitting historic highs. Biden's executive actions and inaction are contributing to high gas prices. We need to completely unleash the American energy sector to provide families financial relief at the pump.

RodneyDavis,"In 2017, Raskin attempted to object to President Trump's election by tossing out state electors. The Dems don't care about ""democracy."" It's all about preserving political power.

That's why they want unelected federal bureaucrats to administer our elections instead of states. https://t.co/oXeyTBhuZ6"
RodneyDavis,"As a leading Republican voice on the House Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee and House Ag Committee, I'm working to make more goods in America, fix our supply chain issues, and promote the transportation industry in Congress so we can grow our communities."
RodneyDavis,I also got to talk with employees about the issues they face. We discussed rail &amp; trucking specifically &amp; the workforce challenges those sectors are facing. Addressing supply chain issues &amp; getting more folks into rail &amp; trucking will help IL farmers get products into the market.
RodneyDavis,"Last week, I visited @GROWMARK's Total Grain Marketing FS facility located outside Champaign. I toured the grain storage and shipping facility and got to see workers load a train headed for the Gulf of Mexico to get area farmers' products out into the global marketplace. https://t.co/6XmFOhmyhZ"
RodneyDavis,"Here is a copy of the communication General Dwight D. Eisenhower (who would later go on to serve as President of the USA) sent to Allied forces ahead of the #DDay landings in Normandy.

RodneyDavis,"78 years ago today, Allied forces launched Operation Overlord and stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, marking a major turning point in the war against Hitler's Germany and Nazi tyranny in Europe. 

God bless the Greatest Generation and our #WWII veterans. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ðŸ¦… #DDay #DDay78 https://t.co/6XZtmuCxqM"

RodneyDavis,"Thanks to @RepBost for his leadership on this issue. I've been working with him to address the backlog of requests at NPRC so our veterans can get timely access to their service records, which are essential to access the benefits they've earned through their military service. https://t.co/nh9ABBlzvS"
RodneyDavis,"Whether itâ€™s PNA repeal or expanding late-term, taxpayer-funded abortion, Pritzkerâ€™s abortion agenda is out-of-step with the people of #IL. As a pro-life lawmaker, I will continue to advance policies that protect life and limit the extreme abortion policies of Dems like Pritzker."
RodneyDavis,"Today is a sad day for life and the unborn in the State of Illinois. With @GovPritzker's repeal of Parental Notification of Abortion, parents now have no legal protections to be involved in their minor childrenâ€™s lives when theyâ€™re seeking an abortion.
