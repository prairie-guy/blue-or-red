SenTinaSmith,"Spent the morning in International Falls to observe the flood damage. This is the worst flood this area has seen in 70+ years. It was great to see people coming together to help. 

I’m hopeful this will qualify for federal aid and I will continue to follow the situation closely. https://t.co/GL7rgVuxKe"
