RepMikeGarcia,"This bill will be paid for by repurposing billions of dollars in unspent COVID-19 aid from the American Rescue Plan, which has been sitting unused for more than a year. This measure, along with others, will have an immediate impact in deterring evil on our campuses."
RepMikeGarcia,I will be introducing a bill soon which will help every public school in America hire &amp; train armed SROs (1 SRO for every 250 students) to protect kids on campus. We must ensure that every school has SROs on campus to stop bad guys from hurting innocent children.
RepMikeGarcia,All options need to be examined to ensure kids remain protected at school. Only 45% of schools have an armed School Resource Officer (SRO) that is on campus at least once a week. Properly trained SROs act as a meaningful deterrent to school violence.
RepMikeGarcia,I recently presented certificates to the Congressional Art Competition winners of #CA25. It was a pleasure to meet with the families and art teachers who have supported these talented young artists. https://t.co/SbEHXOtRrs

RepMikeGarcia,"ICYMI: I spoke at the Santa Clarita Valley’s Memorial Day Ceremony to honor the fallen heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice so we may live in a country where we are kept free and safe. Let’s forever love the nation that they made that sacrifice for.

RepMikeGarcia,Nearly 100 students will not walk with their class because of these ridiculous rules. This does not align with science and the administrators themselves are not following and enforcing the rules. It’s shameful and heartbreaking.
RepMikeGarcia,"My intention was to get them to reverse their policies, just as LAUSD has done, that require every student to be vaccinated to attend their own graduation. Unfortunately, they are claiming that the board's rules are completely inflexible. School choice matters for this reason."
RepMikeGarcia,"I’m a strong supporter of charter schools and school choice. But even at charter schools, the wrong leadership can negatively impact our children. After Granada Hills Charter High School ignored several of my calls and emails, I decided to pay them a visit. https://t.co/F8qvrWyGic"
