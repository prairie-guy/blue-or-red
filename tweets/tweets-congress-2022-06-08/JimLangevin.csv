JimLangevin,"It cost more than $70 to fill a gas tank this weekend. That is unacceptable. 

Rhode Islanders are hurting, which is why I’m fighting to crack down on Big Oil’s price gouging and  excess profits.

JimLangevin,"Thanks for having me! There are few things I love more than talking cyber policy with other cyber wonks.

JimLangevin,"On this, @Sen_JoeManchin has it right.  

There is no reason that an 18-year-old civilian – like the shooters in Uvalde and Buffalo – needs a weapon of war that fires nearly 50 rounds per minute.

JimLangevin,"This weekend, I had the privilege of joining @SECNAV, @GDElectricBoat, and my congressional colleagues for the keel laying of the USS District of Columbia.

We’re making progress by breaking ground at the Arctic Mills, which will house 136 families at affordable rates.

JimLangevin,"Our national security depends on our capacity to set responsible norms in cyberspace.

I have full confidence in @NCFick’s ability to lead @StateCDP, where he will be tasked with coordinating cyber diplomacy with our allies.

I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm his nomination."
JimLangevin,"On June 6, 1944 — D-Day — thousands of Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy to continue the liberation of Europe from the Nazis. 

Nearly eight decades later, we honor those who fought for freedom that day. We will never forget their bravery. https://t.co/n17CrVNjU9"
JimLangevin,"It was another weekend of gun violence in America.

People were killed in mass shootings in Philadelphia, Phoenix, Chattanooga, and Summerton.

Congress MUST act to pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and a ban on assault weapons.

We can't go on like this."
JimLangevin,"Happy birthday, @FLOTUS!  

Thank you for all the work you do to make our country a better place. https://t.co/68HyNPBBVS"

1⃣ Get assault rifles off our streets 
2⃣ Close the background check loopholes 
3⃣ Pass ""red flag"" laws  

There is no reason it should be this hard to #EndGunViolence."
JimLangevin,"This year alone, there have already been over 200 mass shootings in the United States.

Today, we #WearOrange to honor the victims of gun violence and reaffirm our commitment to making our country safer for every American. 

Enough is enough. https://t.co/OokOR4eP65"

We can’t go on like this. It’s time to get weapons of war off our streets.  

I’ll be voting yes.

JimLangevin,"As top oil companies rake in record profits, I'm fighting to rein in corporate greed. 

➡️Exxon Mobil -- Doubled last year's profits  
➡️Chevron -- Highest quarterly profit in 10 years  
➡️Shell -- Highest quarterly profit ever  

We've got to give families a break at the pump."

Godspeed, soldiers.
