RepShontelBrown,"There have been more mass shootings than days so far in 2022

Today, Iâ€™m joining @OversightDems to hear first-hand from victimsâ€™ family members and a survivor of Uvalde, TX and Buffalo, NY. 

Tune in here: https://t.co/LRs6YjKN1u"
RepShontelBrown,"Raising the age for buying semi-automatic weapons to 21.

Banning high-capacity magazines and bump stocks.

Cracking down on gun trafficking and straw purchases.

Closing the ghost gun loophole.

Strengthening safe storage requirements. 

ALL on the House floor today."
RepShontelBrown,"Tomorrow, @OversightDems will hear from victims and survivors from Buffalo and Uvalde.

This hearing will show Americans the tragic toll gun violence is taking on our communitiesâ€”and why we must pass commonsense gun safety legislation. https://t.co/CzxlPtOrc9"
RepShontelBrown,"I shouldn't have to worry about whether my nieces and nephews will make it home from school

Whether my parents or friends will make it home from the grocery store

Whether parishioners in my community will make it home from worshiping their god at church

Enough is enough."
RepShontelBrown,"@POTUS proposed and Congress funded ARPA-H, a new science agency to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimerâ€™s &amp; more. 

With world-class hospitals and higher education institutions, Cleveland is an ideal home for the agency.

RepShontelBrown,"Over 200 mass shootings in the US this year alone. 

Enough is enough.

This week, the House will consider bills to institute red flag laws, raise the purchase age for semi-automatic rifles, strengthen safe-storage requirements, and ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines."
RepShontelBrown,"Gun Violence Awareness Dayâ€”a time to remember the countless lives cut tragically short by guns, from Buffalo and Uvalde to the daily atrocities that occur across America.

It's long past time to make our schools, our supermarkets, our hospitals, and our communities safer."
RepShontelBrown,".@POTUS is right: we should ban assault weapons. 

If we can't do that, let's strengthen background checks. 

Or raise the gun purchasing age to 21. 

Or enact safe storage laws. 

Or pass red flag laws. 

But we must finally do something."
RepShontelBrown,"Ford is investing $1.5 billion to assemble new EVs in Northeast Ohio. The investment will support 1,800 new jobs. 

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Northeast Ohio stands ready to lead the American manufacturing comeback. https://t.co/Lnmm3SbzTV"
RepShontelBrown,"Today, I stopped by @ClevelandClinicâ€™s Main Campus Farmers market with Dr. Bleich, of @USDANutrition.

Almost all of the vendors accept SNAP benefits, helping to expand access to locally-grown, healthy foods. https://t.co/vUfBRLQetH"
