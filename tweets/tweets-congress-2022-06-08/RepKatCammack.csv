RepKatCammack,Joining @seanspicer on Spicer &amp; Co. at the top of the hour in just a few! See you soon!
RepKatCammack,"One of the largest caravans is heading toward the U.S. because Biden told them to come. He hung a welcome sign at our southern border and has encouraged illegal immigration, with May numbers surpassing Clinton-era highs. https://t.co/LvIoYR5EbW"
RepKatCammack,"Biden made ""fighting inflation"" his top economic priority. Biden acknowledged rising gas prices. 

Here are the facts: gas has risen astronomically to the highest prices we've EVER seen under his administration. https://t.co/3Yff2LZAVG"
RepKatCammack,".@POTUS sure breaks a lot of records. 

‚õΩÔ∏è Gas prices reach an all-time high of $4.91/gal
üö® Border crossings surpass Clinton-era highs
üìà Growing presidential disapproval ratings

Americans can't take much more of Democrats' one-party rule."
RepKatCammack,"It's National Fresh Fruit &amp; Veggies Month! Watermelon, blueberries, citrus, zucchini, sweet corn, squash, and beyond‚Äîwe've got plenty of fresh produce year-round in Florida. https://t.co/4lA23SbCtQ"
RepKatCammack,"Glad to join @RepTiffany and @RepJimBanks on a letter questioning @POTUS' decision to reverse Trump's plan to withdraw from the WHO. The WHO has failed on every measure‚Äîthe COVID coverup, emboldening China, and failing in managing global health emergencies. https://t.co/YvOTtbgdQT"
RepKatCammack,"Biden hung a ""welcome"" sign at the border and has invited anyone and everyone to enter the U.S. 

It's his doing and this administration is fully responsible. https://t.co/vACWUNoQaB"
RepKatCammack,"""They fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end conquest. They fight to liberate."" - President Franklin D. Roosevelt 

As we mark the 78 years since D-Day, may we be reminded of the incredible courage and sacrifice of American heroes on the beaches of Normandy. https://t.co/acLDJsQfuV"
RepKatCammack,"Joining @newsmax and @RobFinnertyUSA in just a few. We‚Äôre talking the latest on the baby formula shortage, rising gas prices, and the southern border. See you soon!"
RepKatCammack,"This administration continues to shift blame for rising prices, citing anything but their own abject failures. 

Gas averages $4.75/gallon in the Sunshine State and has been rising since Biden took office. 

Looking for someone to blame, @PressSec? Try @POTUS. https://t.co/KQDbjbMuRr"
RepKatCammack,"Had the opportunity to visit some amazing middle schoolers in Union County at Lake Butler Middle! I spoke to them in the school gym about my job in Congress, answered some of their questions, and heard from several of them about what they'll do to change the world. https://t.co/Rp2c8Q0N6v"
RepKatCammack,"Two homeless veterans, Army Spec. Charles Wesley and Coast Guardsman Robert Hammel Sr., received military honors at a burial ceremony in Ocala yesterday. Our homeless veterans, whose remains often are unclaimed, are heroes. It is our duty to honor them. üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/66dfhxbEFC"
RepKatCammack,"Biden's at the beach in Delaware. Meanwhile, Americans are: 

‚õΩÔ∏è Experiencing record gas prices at the pump
üçº Struggling to find formula 
ü•´ Paying double for groceries

This president has no idea what's happening in our country."
RepKatCammack,"This attack on law enforcement ends in November. Republicans are committed to upholding law and order and putting an end to the nonsense policies that have created this crime wave.

RepKatCammack,Had a great visit with students at Ward-Highlands Elementary School in Ocala! I answered their questions about being a Member of Congress and showed them my voting card! We've got some bright young minds in #FL03 and I can't wait to watch them keep learning and growing! https://t.co/ZjvQUxWfr3
RepKatCammack,".@UF hosted National Science Foundation Director Sethuraman Panchanathan for a tour of UF's NSF-supported projects!

RepKatCammack,"Our Union County adult graduates celebrated a huge milestone last week in receiving their diplomas.

RepKatCammack,"Atlantic Hurricane Season began yesterday! Meteorologists already predict an active season, with storms forming as we speak. Now's the time to prepare; take a look at some of the tips below. https://t.co/ZmWn2ptOCv"
RepKatCammack,"""What do you expect when you kill and you force through regulations and bureaucracy and restriction of permitting on our domestic production of energy? Of course, you're going to see prices go up.""

RepKatCammack,"#TeamKat delivered books to a classroom at W.E. Cherry Elementary School in #FL03's Clay County! As part of our #ReadToLead Library of Congress Book Surplus Program, we're promoting literacy and helping to get books in kids' hands district-wide. https://t.co/CjxFwxXT10"
RepKatCammack,"This administration has failed on every metric when it comes to border security. @SecMayorkas, it's time to do your job. https://t.co/f1TYclZPp0"
