SenWarren,"Big corporations have been price gouging consumers and using inflation as cover to pump up their profits while Americans struggle with rising costs. 

We need to enforce our antitrust laws and crack down on corporate price gouging to bring costs down."
SenWarren,.@SecYellen told me that the IRS needs funding and that creating a free filing tax program that actually works for taxpayers is “definitely a priority” and “something that will happen.” Let's do this. https://t.co/QibOr44H9l
SenWarren,"Investing in quality, affordable child care will help millions of Americans get back to work, support our economic growth, and fight inflation. It’s win-win-win and past time we get it done. Read my new @USATODAY op-ed: https://t.co/cjhMtyZKPH"

SenWarren,"Excellent move by @POTUS to use the Defense Production Act to accelerate America's clean energy manufacturing. I worked with @SenMarkey to urge this action to build solar panels, heat pumps, &amp; combat the climate crisis. More good jobs. Lower energy costs. https://t.co/GFwJXLlSj3"
SenWarren,"In this critical moment in the fight for abortion rights, I'm collecting stories from individuals, orgs &amp; health care providers to hear why access to a safe &amp; legal abortion is important to you &amp; what's at stake if #Roe is overturned. Submit your story:

SenWarren,"The lack of competition in our markets has led to only one, two, maybe three players controlling industries. The consequence? Corporations use their pricing power to jack up costs for Americans. My bill would create competition to lower costs for families.
https://t.co/EV0gBdBT0m"
SenWarren,"Millions of Americans have student debt, but no degree.

These are hardworking people who tried to advance their education with federal loans, but are being crushed by debt.

SenWarren,"Powerfully important investigation by @SecCardona and @FSACOO. 

Too often, for-profit colleges and their corporate executives scam students with deceptive schemes.

The Biden administration is working to hold them accountable and protect students.

SenWarren,"This extremist Supreme Court is going after pretty much anything they want.
 
They've eviscerated voting rights.
 
They’ve given billionaires outsize influence.
 
They’re willing to take away the right to abortion.
 
These are hard fights—and I'm all in.

SenWarren,"I urged @FTC to ensure @Microsoft's proposed merger with @Activision doesn’t interfere with workers unionizing. Workers should be free to join or form a union as protected by law. I'll be watching to see if their words match the Big Tech company’s actions.

https://t.co/2kv4H3H7Ly"

SenWarren,"When I learned that some defrauded borrowers finally receiving relief were hit with huge tax liabilities, I urged @USTreasury to exempt these borrowers from paying taxes on forgiven loans. In 2020, the IRS finally delivered on this. https://t.co/e6NPgJBDsC"

SenWarren,"The Biden administration will automatically cancel the student debt of more than half a million Americans defrauded by Corinthian College — it’s long-overdue justice.

I’ve been fighting for years, alongside @VP &amp; many advocates, to get these borrowers relief from crushing debt."
SenWarren,".@Amazon's proposed worker chat app would block workers from discussing working conditions, barring terms like ""union,"" ""slave labor,"" &amp; ""restroom.""  This is wrong, and could be illegal. @RepCori and I are leading our colleagues to get answers from Amazon.

SenWarren,Big corporations have been hiding behind inflation to jack up prices while collecting record profits. Now CEOs are getting massive raises while workers fall behind and families pay the price. It's shameful. https://t.co/ZPzsVC8BV3
