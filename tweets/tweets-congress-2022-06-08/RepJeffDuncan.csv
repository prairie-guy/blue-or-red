RepJeffDuncan,"What's potentially the largest migrant caravan to ever reach the southern border(10-15,000) is headed to the US, demanding @POTUS grant asylum &amp; recall Title 42. The Biden Admin says ""do not come"" but does nothing to address the heightening #BorderCrisis. Where's Border Czar @VP?"
RepJeffDuncan,"It's time for the Biden Admin. to prioritize reliable &amp; affordable energy as the U.S. faces a summer of potential power outages. Biden's ‚Äúrush to green‚Äù does nothing to address the actual energy needs our country faces &amp; weakens our grid reliability.

RepJeffDuncan,"Gas prices reach new levels daily &amp; are at an all-time high nationwide w/ the national average at almost $5/gal. Americans can't afford @POTUS' war on U.S. energy &amp; if nothing changes, this will only get worse. It's time to UNLEASH American energy to relieve pain at the pump. https://t.co/GZtG7uv1wK"
RepJeffDuncan,"It's simple math: Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline + slashing oil &amp; gas leases + banning offshore drilling + pandering to the radical environmentalist Left + relying on OPEC = Gas prices more than doubling. 

This is the #BidenPriceHike ‚õΩÔ∏è

RepJeffDuncan,"80 years ago, the U.S. Navy won a decisive victory over Japan during the Battle of Midway (June 4-7, 1942). This significant victory altered the course of World War II, and we honor the brave men who helped turn the tide in the Pacific. üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/96LS15anuw"
RepJeffDuncan,"Gas prices have more than DOUBLED since @POTUS took office. Joe Biden is breaking all the wrong records, and Americans cannot afford his self-sabotaging energy policy.
‚û°Ô∏èAverage ‚õΩÔ∏èprice on 1/20/21: $2.39
‚û°Ô∏èAverage ‚õΩÔ∏èprice today: $4.865"
RepJeffDuncan,Good luck and congratulations to the ten South Carolina athletes competing in the Special Olympics USA Games this week in Orlando. We celebrate all your accomplishments and are cheering you on! @2022USAGames https://t.co/RMVfjArJ6k
RepJeffDuncan,I was honored to be a part of the groundbreaking ceremony yesterday for Thomas Mechanical‚Äôs new office in Laurens. It‚Äôs always great to see businesses like Thomas Mechanical growing and expanding in the Third District! https://t.co/BFRZYiFh0T
RepJeffDuncan,"""Mandatory Buy Back Programs"" is just a fancy way of saying ""The government is coming to take your guns."" There is no distinction."
RepJeffDuncan,"I second @Sen_JoeManchin's comments. There's so much we can be doing on a bipartisan basis on energy. Why is Biden so intent on pursuing such a radical, partisan, and anti-American energy agenda? https://t.co/fBZCFXc0j9"
RepJeffDuncan,"Diversity's a fundamental aspect of investing, yet investing in oil &amp; gas companies has been banned in many states. Think of the teachers, firefighters &amp; police officers whose pension funds are suffering because their states placed wokeness ahead of their fiduciary responsibility"
RepJeffDuncan,"Inflation &amp; costs are out of control because of the partisan ""COVID relief"" package that Democrats pushed through at the start of the Biden Admin. Can you imagine what would have happened if they would have been successful in passing their multi-trillion dollar BBB plan?"
RepJeffDuncan,"Joe Biden is a record-setting president (in all the wrong ways). This is #JoeBidensAmerica

RepJeffDuncan,"If @POTUS actually wanted gas prices to go down, ""understanding that feeling personally"" just isn't going to cut it. Unleash domestic energy production and end your war on American energy, Mr. President. https://t.co/TOeUubFr3j"
RepJeffDuncan,"We're in the middle of a labor shortage, not ""one of the strongest job markets."" And if @POTUS actually wants to ""address inflation"" instead of just blaming it on something else, he should start with restraining his reckless federal spending that fuels record-high costs. https://t.co/mAeUQ3OoAD"
