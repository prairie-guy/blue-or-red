SenMikeLee,"I am thrilled my bill honoring the late Candy Bomber, Col. Gail S. Halvorsen, was signed into law today. This bill unanimously passed the Senate and will make sure Col. Halvorsen’s name is forever remembered as the new name of the Provo Veterans Center. https://t.co/bfDJgCOFBX"
SenMikeLee,Gas prices average over $4.95 in Utah and over $4.91 nationally. Yet @POTUS is avoiding his legal obligation to sell energy leases. This administration is snubbing the law so that American families have to pay more at the pump and everywhere else. #gasprices #Bidenflation

SenMikeLee,"The failed policies of @POTUS and Democrats cost Utahns an extra $750 a month. This inflation crisis is the president’s own creation and he seems to have no plans to fix it. 

I have a plan.

SenMikeLee,".@POTUS promised to use every tool to fix the gas price crisis. But he’s refused to end or reduce biofuel mandates that turn food into fuel, crush small refineries, and cost Americans $30+ billion. High gas prices are on purpose. Biden is making you pay for his radical agenda."
SenMikeLee,"Family and civil society breakdown comes with dangerous consequences. Addressing fatherlessness, broken homes, loneliness, bullying, detachment, and addiction must play a role in efforts to keep American communities safe and prosperous.

SenMikeLee,"@POTUS has finally admitted inflation is a problem. Utahns are paying more at the pump, the grocery store, for housing, and for just about everything else. Democrats’ runaway spending is to blame."
