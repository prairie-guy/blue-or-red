RepGosar,"On this day in 1944, true heroes landed on the beaches of Normandy, charging forward under a barrage of enemy gunfire. We are forever grateful for their service to our country. Let us remember their sacrifice, and honor their memory. https://t.co/Xe4WFEb0wV"
RepGosar,https://t.co/HtGdYOhvrR https://t.co/ptVBlXElGE
RepGosar,"The left has reminded us in the past few months that they want to protect abortion (murder) with zero restrictions yet also want to totally disarm Americans to ""protect life"".

They don't care about our broken economy, record high costs, or inflation. 

They don't care about you."
RepGosar,Well said! Love watching @RepMTG Live on @rumblevideo. https://t.co/Eq7Ekpex0d
RepGosar,"@RepAndyBiggsAZ Proud to stand with you on an issue as important as this. Thanks for putting America First, Andy!"
RepGosar,"In other words, @DineshDSouza made a difference.

RepGosar,@ThisIsKyleR @bennyjohnson We're all glad you're still with us. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
RepGosar,"I stood up for Laura Loomer.

I'll stand up for you, too.

""SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED.""

RepGosar,"I especially want this message to reach the youth, the future of our country. Gen Z. You know who you are.

It's MAGA time.

We need you! https://t.co/5uSOWR9vUt https://t.co/NGZGARUpwn"
RepGosar,"Elections have consequences.

Stolen elections have even bigger consequences. 

Our country desperately needs brave &amp; capable patriots to unite and get involved in the political process if you are able.

History is watching and future generations are counting on us."
RepGosar,"When the leftist Regime and their mouthpieces viciously attack patriots like @WendyRogersAZ, @RepMTG, @michellemalkin &amp; others, it tells me that what they're doing is brave &amp; effective. 

Controlled opposition, on the other hand, is rarely attacked by the usual suspects."
RepGosar,"Thanks to Joe Biden and the puppetmasters behind him, narco-terrorists and human traffickers are now in control of our southern border.

 It should be totally and completely closed - but everyone knows the left isn't going to want to stop importing voters anytime soon."
RepGosar,"It is not hateful or extreme to ask that elected representatives of Americans put the interests of those Americans first. 

America First shouldn't be considered ""far-right"", it should be the bare minimum.

You shouldn't settle for anything less."
RepGosar,"If elected officials can't put America First, then there may as well be no America at all - just a giant supermarket of quickly diminishing wealth and resources where anyone else can take whatever they want with both hands."
RepGosar,Gab is one of the only social media platforms to actually make an effort towards reducing pornography on their platform. Hats off to them for leading by example.
RepGosar,"I'm not a prude. But the flimsy ""porn is protected free speech"" argument wasn't true 50 years ago and it's not true now. Porn does not empower women or men - it actually harms them and their brains.

It's simple gratuitous prurience."
RepGosar,"There is abundant research that porn harms developing brains and harms relationships. Cohen nevertheless promotes and supports porn. 

I don't."
RepGosar,"For example, Instagram only pretends to do an age verification.  It is fully pretextual. It simply asks what your birthday is - there is no verification that it is accurate. Kids can type anything they want for a birthday and IG will pretend it's all good."
RepGosar,There is a place in society for healthy sexuality. Exposing 13 year old children to hardcore pornography on so many social media platforms is not the time or place. This is a form of desensitizing children and grooming them.
RepGosar,"NEW: Cohen is virulently pro-pornography, despite the average age of first exposure to porn being 13 (according to the APA). Cohen also omitted the part where I talked about the rampant drug abuse &amp; sex trafficking in the porn industry, I wonder why.

Thanks, Cohen! https://t.co/5aB0xxFBPA"
RepGosar,"Thanks, Jack!

RepGosar,"This, combined with the horrible effects it's having on our young men &amp; women, means that one who opposes any restrictions on porn is ignorant at best and malicious at worst. 

This should be common sense.

But leftists refuse to budge an inch for the sake of sexual immorality."
RepGosar,"JD Vance @JDVance1 is right to call for restrictions on pornography. Liberal courts have declared porn to fall under ""free speech"". What a joke.

Porn is simply too accessible, not to mention the rampant drug abuse and sex trafficking within this subversive, immoral industry."
RepGosar,"Canada is continuing its plunge into total Regime control over their citizens. 

Justin Trudeau is acting like a dictator. 

America can become just like Canada if we allow ourselves to get comfortable and complacent."
