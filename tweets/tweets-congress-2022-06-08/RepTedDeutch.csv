RepTedDeutch,"The first report from the UNHRC's Commission of Inquiry confirmed that the process would be biased from the get-go.

I appreciate the Biden Administration's continued efforts to strongly push back on those at the UN who continue to advance their scurrilous obsession¬†with Israel. https://t.co/lxgP1BwBq1"

RepTedDeutch,"Iran must never get a nuclear weapon.

I look forward to building on my conversations with DG Grossi in Vienna to ensure that Iran‚Äôs nuclear capabilities and its obstruction of the IAEA are addressed at the upcoming IAEA Board of Governor‚Äôs meeting. (2/2)"
RepTedDeutch,The IAEA will soon report that Iran again failed to answer its questions about uranium particles found at 3 undeclared sites &amp; that Iran‚Äôs stockpile of 60% enriched uranium has passed a ‚Äúsignificant quantity‚Äù meaning possibility of manufacturing a weapon cannot be excluded. (1/2) https://t.co/sKPZXuti5t
RepTedDeutch,"Iran must immediately release the two Greek ships it seized and their crews. Maritime security is national security. This blatant act of piracy is yet another reminder that Iran‚Äôs regional aggression must be addressed for the US, the Mid East, &amp; the int'l community to be secure. https://t.co/meaR1298eH"
RepTedDeutch,"Today‚Äôs emergency markup was a step in the right direction to prevent future gun violence. We must take action now.

RepTedDeutch,"""This argument that we‚Äôre rushing into action, that we‚Äôre not being thoughtful. That we should just take some time to really understand what happened before we respond, is another way of saying we have no interest in ever responding to this gun violence epidemic in our country"" https://t.co/Vx4HKrsY5Z"
RepTedDeutch,"We can‚Äôt keep claiming that updating our gun laws won‚Äôt prevent mass tragedies while inaction continues to claim American lives.

We owe it to every family that continues to suffer to pass legislation to end gun violence.

Watch my @HouseJudiciary remarks here: https://t.co/PeT70I9cSk"
RepTedDeutch,"I applaud @HouseJudiciary for holding an emergency markup on critical gun control legislation.

It‚Äôs time to take decisive action to confront the devastating events of the last two weeks‚Äî and the last thirty years. https://t.co/0HLsiUnhsT"
RepTedDeutch,"#Pride Month is a time to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community‚Äôs diversity, joys, and accomplishments. As states, including FL, pass transphobic &amp; homophobic policies, it's also a time to continue the fight for full equality.

This month &amp; always I'm proud to stand w/LGBTQ+ Americans. https://t.co/CzS0UCvyS3"
