RepTeresaLF,"I welcome @POTUS’ visit to northern NM. He can meet our families and communities who’ve lost so much. I will discuss our bill to compensate all those who’ve lost homes, businesses, and livelihood to the devastating fires started by the prescribed burns."

RepTeresaLF,"Clearly, USFS needs to enact substantive reforms to ensure accountability and restore trust in their use of prescribed burns. My Hermit’s Peak Fire Assistance Act will provide compensation from these prescribed fires, but we must also protect our forests. (2/2)"
RepTeresaLF,It is outrageous that USFS started both the Calf Canyon and Hermit’s Peak Wildfires. I called for an independent federal investigation so that no other community in NM or the U.S. suffers the destruction we have seen from these catastrophic wildfires.(1/2) My statement below  ⇩ https://t.co/Q8zKQuDNiF
