SenShelby,Pleased that @NFWFnews and @NOAA have awarded #DauphinIsland $3M to help restore Aloe Bay's shoreline habitat and increase its resiliency. This project aims to mitigate damage from future storms and restore native marsh and oyster habitat. Great news for AL's coast. https://t.co/b6ybbr9yvf
SenShelby,"Today I reviewed the FY23 request for the @USNationalGuard and Reserves during a defense appropriations hearing. From responding to COVID, hurricanes, and wildfires to safeguarding our border, these men and women have served our country with distinction. https://t.co/fy9Ge6Tl2D https://t.co/kAcpZUWP0q"
SenShelby,"78 years ago, the #GreatestGeneration made history by storming the beaches of Normandy, beginning the liberation of Europe from German control. Those heroes stood strong and fought for what was right. On #DDay, we remember their bravery and honor their legacy."
SenShelby,Pleased that the @USGAO Space Command report reiterates what the IG report said last month. The @USAirForce followed strict criteria when they evaluated and selected Huntsville. I agree that Huntsville was the right pick for the job.
