repdarrellissa,"Democrats insist their Jan. 6 committee is about democracy. But they're telling media they think it could  save them from disaster in the midterms.

Shameless. This is known as saying the quiet part out loud."
repdarrellissa,"If Joe Biden is worried about being compared to Jimmy Carter, he should stop compiling an even worse record in office."
repdarrellissa,"June 6th is forever embedded in the American experience. D-Day turned the tide of war, advanced the cause of peace, and ensured the defeat of tyranny.

35,000 came ashore that day and thousands made the ultimate sacrifice. Don't ever forget who they were and what they did."
repdarrellissa,The White House has officially reached the point where everything else is to blame for Biden’s disasters and nothing is their fault.
repdarrellissa,"When Democrats like Eric Holder and Lois Lerner are held in contempt of Congress, the swamp protects them.

When it’s a Republican like Peter Navarro, he gets led away in handcuffs.

Time to end DC’s double-standard for justice once and for all."
repdarrellissa,"Biden today: ""Since I took office, families are carrying less debt, their average savings are up … more Americans feel financially comfortable …”

He has no idea what he’s talking about."
repdarrellissa,"The day we learn exactly how this White House caused America’s baby formula shortage … the Democrat Jan. 6 committee issues another press release.

Utterly predictable."
repdarrellissa,"President Biden had the opportunity tonight to help unite the country.

He didn’t. He lashed out at everyone who doesn’t share his gun control agenda. Then he demanded voters elect more Democrats.

His worst speech yet."
repdarrellissa,"Six months ago today the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee thanked Biden for a two-cent reduction in gas prices.

It's up $1.34 since then. An all-time high."
repdarrellissa,If you watched Biden yesterday admit he has no idea what’s going on with his baby formula shortage — or heard him last week tell another fantasy story about being appointed to the Navy — you know why the White House works so hard to not let him talk in public.
repdarrellissa,"Of course Biden and his staff can’t keep their story straight about what they knew of their baby formula crisis and when they knew it.

They’re making it up as they go."
