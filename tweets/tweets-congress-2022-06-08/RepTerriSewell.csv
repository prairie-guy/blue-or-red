RepTerriSewell,".@RepTerriSewell While we cannot prevent every tragedy, these measures will greatly reduce the impact of gun violence &amp; save lives.

This is not about targeting responsible gun owners. This is about common sense measures that will keep our children, families, &amp; communities safe."
RepTerriSewell,".@RepTerriSewell The Protecting Our Kids Act includes common sense gun safety measures supported by the vast majority of Americans. It would crack down on illegal gun trafficking and prevent guns from getting into the hands of those who shouldn‚Äôt have them.

I will be voting YES."
RepTerriSewell,President Biden said it best. The epidemic of gun violence has turned our communities into battlefields and left families broken &amp; devastated. We cannot continue to mourn these tragedies without doing all we can to prevent them. I join in calling on my colleagues to take action. https://t.co/EOEs2X7v0x
