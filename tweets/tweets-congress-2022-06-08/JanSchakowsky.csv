JanSchakowsky,"In Illinois, for every 10 extremely low-income renters, there are fewer than four affordable and available rental units. The pandemic has only exacerbated the #affordablehousing crisis. Any reconciliation bill must include the housing provisions already passed by the House."

‚úÖcreate jobsüë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
‚úÖgenerate revenue for state &amp; local governmentsüí∞
‚úÖsupport a more stable &amp; inclusive economy üìà"

JanSchakowsky,"The Griswold #SCOTUS decision made birth control legally accessible 57 years ago today. Sadly, Griswold is next on the chopping block if the rogue Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.

JanSchakowsky,"Americans suffering from Lymphedema deserve access to treatment. As we recognize #NationalCancerSurvivorsDay, let‚Äôs ensure those dealing with this horrible disease aren‚Äôt burdened by the costs. It‚Äôs time we pass my bipartisan Lymphedema Treatment Act. https://t.co/Vy0VnC49HM"
