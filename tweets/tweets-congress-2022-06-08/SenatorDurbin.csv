SenatorDurbin,"Gun violence comes in many forms here in the U.S and it is going to take a lot of work to stop the violence.

SenatorDurbin,"I’m live on the Senate floor discussing the Corinthian Colleges settlement and legislation we are considering on the Senate floor this week, the PACT Act. It would help veterans who were exposed to toxic chemicals during their service. Watch here: https://t.co/0hzQWswx3i"
SenatorDurbin,White supremacist violence has swept across America. And this trend raises the obvious question: Why is this threat getting worse? We cannot deny that hate has a big platform. And some media figures—like Tucker Carlson—are dragging racist conspiracy theories into the mainstream. https://t.co/N90aDs8pNf
SenatorDurbin,"Had the chance to meet Uvalde native @McConaughey in DC today to discuss the horrific mass shooting at Robb Elementary as well as the larger problem of gun violence in America.

SenatorDurbin,"The U.S. has had at least 246 mass shootings in the past 157 days. More than one a day.

SenatorDurbin,UPDATE: Pleased to learn that Burnett has stepped down as president of @UOPX following an Ed Dept inquiry. I commend @usedgov for proactively looking into Burnett's history scamming IL's Westwood College students out of an education and burying them in debt. https://t.co/MEKntQ4Xdb
SenatorDurbin,I joined local leaders at Stroger Hospital in Cook County today to discuss the devastating impacts of gun violence. Awareness is not enough. Congress must act on common sense reforms to close gaps in our gun laws and help protect our kids and communities from the next shooting.
SenatorDurbin,"I #WearOrange today in honor of Hadiya Pendleton from Chicago.

SenatorDurbin,"President Biden is right: How much more carnage are we willing to accept?

No one law can prevent every act of violence. But how can we look at Uvalde, Buffalo, and Tulsa and conclude that our hands are tied? We must act to address our nation’s gun violence epidemic."
SenatorDurbin,"Currently, approximately 7.8 percent of BOP inmates are housed in a form of restricted housing. The Senate Judiciary Committee will soon hold a hearing on the continued overuse of solitary confinement and restricted housing in federal prison facilities, including USP Thomson."
SenatorDurbin,"If these reports prove accurate, this conduct almost certainly contravenes BOP policies, infringes on civil rights and possibly violates federal criminal laws. That's why I'm calling for an investigation into USP Thomson &amp; announcing a @JudiciaryDems hearing on prison conditions. https://t.co/WEKMCGOKAP"

SenatorDurbin,"That includes continuing to work with @SenJeffMerkley, @SenatorBaldwin, and @SenBooker to pass the Equality Act and ensure that federal civil rights laws explicitly protect LGBTQ Americans from discrimination."
SenatorDurbin,"From #Stonewall to the daily courage of having #pride in who you are, I have no doubt the resiliency of the LGBTQ community will persist. And as Chair of @JudiciaryDems, I'm committed to doing my part to build a country where equality can be the lived reality for every American."
SenatorDurbin,"From Florida silencing LGBTQ students, to Texas and other states targeting trans kids, the rights of LGBTQ Americans—and especially LGBTQ kids—are still under attack."
SenatorDurbin,"Happy #Pride2022 to the LGBTQ community in Illinois and across the country!

#PrideMonth is rooted in challenging the status quo. We've made enormous strides in the past few decades, but until everyone can be who they are and love who they love, #Pride will always be a protest. https://t.co/ZLVvWYdG4y"
