RepPerlmutter,"Too many communities and families have forever been scarred from gun violence. This has to stop.

The legislation before the House this week is a practical, simple and reasonable effort to curb gun violence in this country.

RepPerlmutter,One of my biggest priorities has always been ensuring our Veterans receive the benefits they earn and deserve - and that includes housing. We must improve the VA mortgage loan process to ensure it makes home ownership attainable for more Veterans. https://t.co/NaP8UAl113
RepPerlmutter,"The support from the @usmayors is a testament to the importance of #SAFEBanking for the financial security of legal businesses and the public safety of cities across the country. 

It's time to make the #SAFEBankingAct law!

RepPerlmutter,"I appreciate @safe4equity’s support of the #SAFEBankingAct and their ongoing advocacy for federal cannabis reform. #SAFEBanking is a critical piece of reform that will provide immediate relief to state-legal cannabis businesses, especially small and minority-owned operators. https://t.co/jlzPWKAkgP"
RepPerlmutter,"Multiple reports indicate the previous administration's process was inconsistent and flawed.

With these clear findings, the Biden Administration needs to review this decision to ensure it is what's best for our national security as well as our mission in space. https://t.co/CnPZ0SmQSX"
RepPerlmutter,"As we mark Gun Violence Awareness Day I want to remember those we've lost to gun violence including here in communities across Colorado.

Let's do more than honor victims with a moment of silence. Let's ensure no community endures this type of heartbreak again. Let's take action. https://t.co/YEXLFTTHtE"
RepPerlmutter,"Congress has failed to act for far too long. We cannot – we will not - go on like this. I will support the gun violence prevention package in the House next week, and I implore my colleagues in the House and Senate to do the same. #EndGunViolenceNow

RepPerlmutter,"From banning weapons of war and the accessories that make them more lethal to requiring background checks for all gun purchases and safe storage in the home, these are practical steps that will help make gun violence less easy, less frequent and less deadly."
RepPerlmutter,"I share the frustration of President Biden &amp; so many Americans who are impacted by gun violence in our communities. Gun violence has stolen too many innocent lives, &amp; for Congress to continue to fail to pass any sort of commonsense gun violence prevention measures is ridiculous."
RepPerlmutter,"Americans have the right to feel safe in their community – whether at school, a place of worship, the grocery story, or their doctor’s office. 

Inaction to prevent future gun violence tragedies is not an option.

RepPerlmutter,"Robert Corcoran was a hero in WWII and the work of his family to bring his remains home after too many years is admirable.

My office is working with the DOD on this case. I hope we can help the family be successful in finally bringing the remains of their loved one home at last. https://t.co/JJcJJoCgRN"
RepPerlmutter,"Despite the progress we’ve made the past few years, we still have more work to do. 

Every person should be able to live their life free of harassment, discrimination and violence. I will never stop fighting to ensure full equality for LGBTQ+ people.
