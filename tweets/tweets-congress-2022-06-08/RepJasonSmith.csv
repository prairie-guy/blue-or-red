RepJasonSmith,"I led a group of House Republicans to the border to see the real cost of Biden's border crisis.

There are major gaps in the border wall and yet Biden is letting $350 million of steel rust away - all while cartels make millions each day smuggling humans and illicit drugs. https://t.co/UoSpliZ07U"
RepJasonSmith,"Border Patrol agents need to know they are fully supported in their mission to protect the homeland.

Right now, they have a President who cut the budget for the core functions of the Department of Homeland Security by $800 million. Totally unacceptable. https://t.co/lA3cIpOBXW"
RepJasonSmith,"American Businesses.

American Energy Producers.

Putin.

Every month, Joe Biden finds a new villain to blame for inflation. The real culprit is closer to home – his agenda.

Specifically: the Democrat-passed $2 trillion “American Rescue Plan.”"
RepJasonSmith,The state of Texas is spending $2.5 million each week to deal with Biden’s border crisis because the President has abandoned the border and won’t do his job to secure the homeland. https://t.co/JeAt0ZtlAT
RepJasonSmith,"“No, Jimmy, trust me – it’ll make sense once people see MY inflation numbers…” https://t.co/d8ppf9TkaO"
RepJasonSmith,"This is a gap in the border wall that President Biden refuses to finish.
 
I saw several gaping holes like this during my trip to the southern border.

Biden's policies have left the door open for illegal immigrants and illicit drugs to come across the border. https://t.co/f3MpuV7i6M"
RepJasonSmith,"At the southern border, we saw the border wall built under President Trump’s leadership.
 
Trump built a border wall using the money Congress appropriated.
 
Biden has done the exact opposite - letting border wall steel rust while illegally freezing construction funds. https://t.co/NypC99WiCU"
RepJasonSmith,"The Biden Administration was slow to acknowledge the baby formula shortage, and now his administration is having trouble getting one of the few factories left up and running again."
RepJasonSmith,"This week I joined the Texas Highway Patrol on a patrol of the Rio Grande River.
 
It's clear that the brave men and women who protect our border are doing all they can to address the sheer volume of migrants coming across the southern border. https://t.co/yiWQZXEOOI"
RepJasonSmith,"Biden and Washington Democrats like to pass the blame for inflation to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Before a single Russian troop set foot in Ukraine, inflation had ARLEADY increased 7.5% since Biden took office."
RepJasonSmith,"ICYMI: They’ve revised the 2022 first quarter GDP numbers – FURTHER DOWN. Turns out, the economy shrunk by 1.5% – over 4 percentage points less than CBO projected for this period when Biden took office."
RepJasonSmith,I will ALWAYS fight to protect law-abiding Americans’ 2nd Amendment rights from Washington Democrats’ anti-gun agenda. Period.
RepJasonSmith,"Biden's policies are a DISASTER! Record inflation, record high gas prices, baby formula shortage. Americans can't afford Democrat one-party rule in Washington!"
RepJasonSmith,"Congratulations to the Southeast Missouri State Baseball Team on winning the OVC Championship and advancing to the NCAA Tournament.

Good luck today and Go Redhawks! https://t.co/nnZSkMoXZJ"
RepJasonSmith,What we did get from ARPA’s $2 trillion is the worst inflation crisis in 40 years. Inflation is up 11% since Biden took office – meaning those who have jobs have paychecks that cannot keep up with the spike in prices brought on by Biden’s deficit spending agenda.
RepJasonSmith,"Today's jobs report shows labor force participation remains below where we were pre-COVID. Biden’s $2 trillion American Rescue Plan spending spree has not produced the results he promised – in fact, it kept people out of the workforce."
RepJasonSmith,"Hawaii is lei-ing down $5 million from the American Rescue Plan for a Green Job Youth Corps to provide ""support for the green sector.""

ARPA money going to liberal wish-list items is becoming as constant the waves crashing on Waikiki beach.

RepJasonSmith,"Appreciate McAllen Mayor Javier Villalobos hosting a roundtable today with officials &amp; law enforcement to discuss the impact of the border crisis.

Illegal immigrants coming to the border are forced by the cartels to wear wristbands to identify that they've paid them for passage. https://t.co/VuvcrNmKzq"
RepJasonSmith,Took a boat tour of the Rio Grande. Over 174 different nationalities have been apprehended in the RGV sector. State &amp; federal law enforcement are battling the flow of illegal immigrants &amp; illicit drugs every hour of every day thanks to Biden's border crisis. https://t.co/JjLqG4b2RY
RepJasonSmith,This steel sits here rusting away while illegal drugs are crossing the southern border - enough fentanyl to kill all Americans 7 times over. https://t.co/3AyzjCwzCw
RepJasonSmith,This picture says it all: tons of border wall steel worth millions of taxpayer dollars rusting away because @POTUS Biden refuses to build the wall and secure the border. https://t.co/k52WzNAysf
RepJasonSmith,Tune in as I join @GriffJenkins @FoxNews LIVE from the US-mexico border to discuss the latest in President Biden's #bordercrisis https://t.co/6cQ4THABz2
RepJasonSmith,"This steel shouldn’t be rusting on the ground - it should be part of a finished border wall. 

His first day in office, Biden illegally halted border wall construction. Now, contractors are being paid $6M per day to babysit $350M in materials. https://t.co/4VrvsAgGw5"
RepJasonSmith,"We were just briefed on Operation Lone Star. President Biden is refusing to secure the border, so Texas is having to step in and do what it can to protect its communities. The state is having to spend $2.5M/week on Biden's border crisis. https://t.co/6UwkEsMDvh"
RepJasonSmith,President Trump was building the wall to secure our border. President Biden halted the $1.4 billion for construction of the wall and now $350M worth of rusting border wall materials are wasting away because of Biden's actions. https://t.co/AWNey01LvW
RepJasonSmith,"This is why House Republicans are at the border today and specifically the Rio Grande Valley which, as reported, is ""ground zero"" for the border crisis. 

The number of illegal immigrants coming across the border every month, due to Biden's Border Crisis, is staggering. https://t.co/sc0UnKqs33"
RepJasonSmith,Honored to meet some Army National Guard soldiers from Missouri helping protect our homeland at the border. Grateful for their service to our nation and the people of MO. https://t.co/km2sK2yoyo
RepJasonSmith,"Standing at a portion of the border wall President Trump built to help secure our homeland. 

On his first day in office @POTUS Biden halted construction of the wall and fueled a border crisis. https://t.co/D4xTjaUqUX"
RepJasonSmith,"At the border today, hearing about the challenges of patrolling such a large land area when there is a massive increase in the # of illegal immigrants. Our brave Border Patrol agents are also having to plan for things to get worse if the Title 42 border policy goes away."
RepJasonSmith,"President Biden’s border policies allowed 2.4 million encounters with illegal immigrants to happen at the southern border. With the highest number of illegal immigrants coming over in 20 years, Biden’s budget cuts Homeland Security funding – including a $150M cut to ICE. https://t.co/UDi2Gl2a1c"
RepJasonSmith,"Border Patrol briefed us on the state of the border.

@SecMayorkas couldn't be more wrong: The Biden Administration hasn't ""effectively managed"" the border.

Cartels have made $96 billion off the chaos and lawlessness at the southern border. https://t.co/pHCqp7q0NM"
RepJasonSmith,"Just toured a processing facility where illegal immigrants come first after crossing the southern border.

It's clear that Biden’s Border Crisis has put Border Patrol in an untenable situation trying to keep up with a surge of illegal immigrants. https://t.co/j2i2SH4M1w"
