MikeKellyPA,"Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) says she drove her electric vehicle past every gas station and it didn't matter to her how high the price was.

Median income of my constituents in #PA16: $54,627. Avg. EV price: $60,000.

Democrats don't understand the problems of everyday Americans. https://t.co/4DZBS7F5Of"

MikeKellyPA,Americans are struggling to get to and from work without breaking the bank and the Biden Administration seems to care less by the day. https://t.co/SO2NNySm2X
MikeKellyPA,President Biden has decided to set more devastating costs and regulations on the oil industry - a move that will only drive gas prices higher. RFS compliance = 20-30 cents/gallon for consumers now. This mandate will skyrocket that number. https://t.co/iieD1CGHdE
MikeKellyPA,"This is a slap in the face to hardworking American gas and oil producers across the country. President Biden would rather negotiate with foreign enemies and human rights abusers then unleash the American energy right beneath our feet. #BidenEnergyCrisis
