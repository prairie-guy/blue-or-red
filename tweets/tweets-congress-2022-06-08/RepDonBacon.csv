RepDonBacon,"Met with Chairman Eric Chu &amp; members from the Taiwan Embassy. Taiwan is a beacon of democracy, human rights, &amp; free enterprise in Asia. The US remains committed to them &amp; strengthening our deterrence capabilities in the region. They also love Nebraska beef! üá∫üá∏üáπüáº @MOFA_Taiwan https://t.co/VHUacui2M6"
RepDonBacon,@Rebecca28049528 @RepTomEmmer It‚Äôs the top issue on voters‚Äô minds.

RepDonBacon,@frenchat @UAPipeTrades With 5 more seats or better we‚Äôll be in majority and we can pass legislation you are asking for.
RepDonBacon,@frenchat I‚Äôve supported all legislation that supports energy independence. I‚Äôm #1 rated member of Congress by the @UAPipeTrades for fighting for ‚Äúall of the above‚Äù energy infrastructure.
RepDonBacon,"Thank you to Mrs. Doris Lassiter from Nebraska Center for Health Families and Bread of the World for stopping by to discuss food insecurity and my support for HR 4693, the Global Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act of 2021, which will help 58 million children in need. https://t.co/iWHp75wk0H"
RepDonBacon,@holly_harris @Rebecca28049528 Air Power!
RepDonBacon,@holly_harris @Rebecca28049528 Thank you.
RepDonBacon,"The Lugar Center is the best-known index on rating bipartisanship in Congress and rates me #12 out of 435 members! Since elected, I have worked across the aisle without compromising my principles or breaking promises I have made to the citizens of #NE02. https://t.co/YjZHTpF1wd"
RepDonBacon,"June is #NationalDairyMonth. This is a good time to mention that all 195 dairy farms in Nebraska are family-owned and operated, and #NE02 is home to two dairy processing plants! Thanks to Nebraska's dairy farmers for your tireless work to feed our state, country, and world. https://t.co/pyN8hmHXQj"
RepDonBacon,"Statistics don't lie! Nearly 17 months into the Biden Administration, the U.S. is still 1.19 MILLION jobs SHORT of where we were prior to COVID. Consumer confidence is getting worse by the month. https://t.co/mBmfCBYMUd"
RepDonBacon,"The return of war to the European continent earlier this year reminds us of the long and brutal occupation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union. @RepRubenGallego and I will always stand by our #NATO allies and defend our liberties.

RepDonBacon,"On this day in 1944, parachuting out of aircraft and running across beaches, Americans from all walks of life began a decisive point in the Allies victory in WW2. They are the best of the Greatest Generation &amp; we are forever indebted to them for their service and sacrifice. #DDay https://t.co/NDKEz7joVU"
RepDonBacon,@MarkHenty @IamkathyVancura It‚Äôs not free. That‚Äôs why Joe Biden even disagrees with you.
RepDonBacon,@MarkHenty @IamkathyVancura Just remember that Joe Biden said Medicare for All would bankrupt America.
RepDonBacon,"To stay updated with my office, sign up for our e-newsletter! https://t.co/LZdI8Xkapq https://t.co/HkdiRbksIM"
RepDonBacon,"Cancer has struck millions of American families, including mine. Having access to intensive early detection, individuals are able to address and treat cancer earlier on. I cosponsored H.R. 4110 as this bill provides those with inherited mutation access to early treatment. https://t.co/V6niBAP2Lv"
RepDonBacon,"Today is #NationalCancerSurvivorsDay and as a supporter of the #LymphedemaTreatmentAct (S.1315/H.R.3630) Act, I want to share with you that 40% of all breast cancer survivors and 15% of cancer survivors overall are affected by lymphedema. https://t.co/wQV7isKA1L"
RepDonBacon,@Jdangelo4404 @dennis_fujan @POTUS This President cut permits for production and infrastructure.
RepDonBacon,"The COVID pandemic highlighted how vital supply chains are to our national security. As a member of the Defense Critical Supply Chain Task Force, my colleagues and I are committed to identifying risks and keeping a competitive edge over our adversaries. https://t.co/eir47iIEpm"
RepDonBacon,"@Beth867_539 Cut production permits and slow rolled infrastructure permits. He promised he‚Äôd do so during the campaign, and he did."
RepDonBacon,"@dennis_fujan @Jdangelo4404 @POTUS The left wages war against US energy companies, then asks OPEC to do more, and wants a deal with Iran and Venezuela. Terrible policy."
RepDonBacon,"‚ÄúHe reflected the best of America with his courage, and doing the right thing, and his bravery,‚Äù he said. https://t.co/yGygSe49XQ"
RepDonBacon,"June is #NationalSafetyMonth! It's important to identify safety hazards and risks in your home, work, and community. Having first aid kits on hand, practicing fire drills, or providing water safety tips for the summer are just a few things we can do to make our lives safer. https://t.co/RjEIpoSHZ7"
RepDonBacon,"I'm committed to fighting against the high inflation hurting the people of #NE02. The main cause is EXCESSIVE government spending, which is why I have voted against the House majority‚Äôs $7 trillion in new government spending during this year alone. https://t.co/JMrsd045je"
RepDonBacon,"@RobAnderson2018 @JonesWest86 @gb4bedfordfalls @existentialhum Gas prices and inflation were climbing fast prior to Russia‚Äôs invasion, but yes Russian invasion made it worse. The President campaigned on going after America‚Äôs fossil fuel industry, but now wants OPEC to pump more."
RepDonBacon,Getting baby formula shouldn‚Äôt be something parents have to worry about every day. I'm working hard with both sides of the aisle to ensure parents get their children the formula they need with H.R. 7875. https://t.co/YslvRtLTr9
RepDonBacon,"Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs America. Energy independence is national security, lowering cost of living, and creating more American jobs. https://t.co/cryIyKcy8Y"
RepDonBacon,"It took almost 9 months to get a response from Biden‚Äôs State Department about honoring our commitments to our U.S. citizens in Afghanistan and Afghan allies, who supported our troops. We will not forget them. https://t.co/XeJ7ns2rIn"
RepDonBacon,"@existentialhum Those are nice cars. Unfortunately, many cannot afford them. The average family has lost $500 in purchasing power a month due to inflation, so summer travels will be impacted. Safe travels."
RepDonBacon,Gas prices keep rising! How is it affecting your summer vacation plans? https://t.co/Ixi320y3Or
RepDonBacon,2021 was the WORST year for inflation since 1981. https://t.co/v3dhbIXpoy https://t.co/OEQQPJJcfP
RepDonBacon,@bellsnwhistles @ad1220 No struggle. Read Larry Summers who worked for two Dem Presidents. He warned‚Ä¶ Biden and Pelosi charged on anyway.
RepDonBacon,@bellsnwhistles @ad1220 The nation knows what the worst inflation in 40 years is though.
RepDonBacon,"CBS: Yellen admits she was ""wrong"" about inflation in 2021

The Administration was warned in March, 2021 that its spending plans would trigger inflation. Biden pressed on anyway with partisan party-line votes &amp; now we have the worst inflation in 40 years. https://t.co/7wrVluvob6"
RepDonBacon,@Rebecca28049528 I hear from local constituents that disagree with you too.
RepDonBacon,"While I will continue to urge the Administration to address the infant formula shortage, I'm an original co-sponsor of H.R. 7875 and H.Con Res. 90 and sent a letter to the FDA. In the meantime, here is some information regarding access to imported supplies https://t.co/14EygqIxOz"
RepDonBacon,"Local law enforcement tell me the #1 action to reduce gun violence is to hold people accountable for making illegal straw purchases. These violent crimes happen too often, which is why I introduced H.R. 1604. This will bring justice and safety to our affected communities. https://t.co/TLUTBMPVEe"
RepDonBacon,"Gas prices keep soaring to record highs. Meanwhile, Biden recently cut production permits, &amp; is slow-rolling energy infrastructure permits.  While our energy production is being held down, Biden is asking OPEC to produce more. This is a failed policy. https://t.co/anSId9DAqT"
RepDonBacon,"H.R. 943, now law, creates a grant program to help teachers incorporate Holocaust education into students' lesson plans. As a lead cosponsor for the GOP side, I made it one of my legislative priorities to get this passed so that we never forget or let history repeat itself. https://t.co/67LC4HZW7b"
RepDonBacon,"@sebomaha28 @PeakPathways @janekleeb @NebraskaYR @DonJBacon The point is I‚Äôve advocated and supported community health centers contrary to what your partisan and snarky posts said. 

You‚Äôll enjoy our extensive labor support this year too."
RepDonBacon,"Mental healthcare IS healthcare. Decades ago we disinvested from in-patient care, but didn‚Äôt transfer that spending to out-patient care. 1/3 of America has no access to mental healthcare, and we must do better. Thanks to Nebraska Mental Health Conference for inviting me to speak. https://t.co/fdCiGaLtMn"
RepDonBacon,"@sebomaha28 @PeakPathways @janekleeb @NebraskaYR @DonJBacon Actually, I requested full funding for community health centers every year‚Ä¶ and they know it. We had a ribbon cutting for Charles Drew yesterday‚Ä¶ you‚Äôd have loved it."
RepDonBacon,@csg0123 @usairforce You have your facts wrong. Do better research.
RepDonBacon,This weekend's chemical plant fire shows why I co-sponsored The Federal Firefighter Fairness Act of 2021. It will classify illnesses like lung diseases &amp; certain cancers as job-related. Firefighters put their lives on the line and regularly expose themselves to toxic substances. https://t.co/UbUFIVcT6s
RepDonBacon,Military readiness depends on our ability to dominate the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). I was a career electronic warfare officer in the @usairforce and now I serve as Co-Chair of the Congressional Electromagnetic Warfare Working Group for the fifth year in a row. #JEMSO https://t.co/Pb9aSPQm6P
RepDonBacon,Charles Drew Health Center‚Äôs Teen &amp; Young Adult Center opened today. It provides primary medical and behavioral health care in a youth-friendly environment. Community Health Centers are vital to our community. https://t.co/GSm4PebBCC
