SenatorBennet,"Last year, we enhanced the #ChildTaxCredit to cut taxes for working families in this country. 

When Congress failed to extend it, we turned our backs on the 90% of kids who benefited from it.

As families face high costs, I'm doing everything I can to make this permanent. https://t.co/J91IDOH5wk"
SenatorBennet,"When hurricanes hit the East Coast, Washington springs into action to support communities — as it should.
 
But we haven’t seen that response to the Western water crisis.
 
For our farmers, ranchers, foresters, and way of life, this is a five-alarm fire. We must protect the West. https://t.co/oxbJOeDyAl"
SenatorBennet,"NOW: I'm chairing the first Subcommittee on Conservation, Climate, Forestry, and Natural Resources hearing since 2013 to sound the alarm about our western water crisis. 

The West hasn't been this dry in 1,200 years. We must act. https://t.co/0L0qkqxHas"
SenatorBennet,"If @POTUS is going to spend $230 billion to cancel student loan debt, he needs to do it in a way that reaches those who need it most &amp; reforms the underlying system that got us here.

Otherwise, we’re simply passing along this injustice to another generation of college students. https://t.co/1O9cycC77F"
SenatorBennet,"I'm heading to the Senate floor to call for reform to America’s broken student loan system and new pathways to economic opportunity for all, especially the 70% of Americans who don’t go to college.

Watch: https://t.co/cmXncQD0j7"
SenatorBennet,".@POTUS responded to our calls to provide relief to American solar from @CommerceGov's harmful tariffs investigation.

This is an important step to give Colorado solar companies the certainty needed to advance new projects, grow their workforce, and help meet our climate goals. https://t.co/M5aGXbMWyy"
SenatorBennet,"I'm working on legislation to protect the beautiful landscapes of Gunnison County — and I want your feedback.

SenatorBennet,"ICYMI: The House advanced two of my bills — the Give Kids a Chance Act to expand ways for doctors to treat pediatric cancer, and the MATE Act to address our opioid crisis. 

Both will equip our health care system to better support patients. 

Let's get these over the finish line."
SenatorBennet,"Fantastic news — 

@BLMNational announced new protections &amp; expanded access to the Dominguez-Escalante National Conservation Area through the Land and Water Conservation Fund.

After years of fighting to fully fund LWCF, I'm delighted to see these dollars put to work in Colorado."
SenatorBennet,"Grateful to receive the Medicare Advantage Champion Award from @protectmyMA.

I'll continue fighting to support this program and provide affordable and accessible health care coverage for Colorado seniors like Pat.

SenatorBennet,"For years, Corinthian College defrauded and misled people seeking higher education to better their future. 

I’m glad to see the Biden Administration right this wrong.

SenatorBennet,"The @US_SpaceCom basing process lacked integrity &amp; neglected national security considerations. 

The American people must be able to trust that this decision is objective &amp; prioritizes our security.

Peterson remains the only &amp; best home for @US_SpaceCom.

SenatorBennet,"Last week, a gunman robbed the futures of 21 people — 19 kids.
 
With one mass shooting after another, it's unacceptable that the Senate has failed to respond. Failed to protect our kids and communities. 
 
This #GunViolenceAwarenessMonth, the Senate must act to end gun violence."
SenatorBennet,"Every #PrideMonth is an opportunity for us to celebrate the historic steps we have taken toward equality for the LGBTQ community. 

But as LGBTQ Americans continue to face discrimination and violence, we cannot ignore that there is more work to do.

We must pass the #EqualityAct."
