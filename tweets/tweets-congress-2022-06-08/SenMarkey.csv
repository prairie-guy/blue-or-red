SenMarkey,I am grateful to the gun violence survivors and advocates with @Everytown who are taking the time to share their stories in support of gun safety legislation. It’s time for Congress to listen and act. https://t.co/RzQGE4IGWS
SenMarkey,"In March, I announced my plan for 500 Days to Energy Independence. With President Biden's decision to invoke the Defense Production Act, we are one step closer to achieving a clean energy future. Now, Congress must send bold climate and clean energy measures to his desk. https://t.co/LvSustpAKN"
SenMarkey,It was my distinct honor this weekend to welcome refugees from Afghanistan to their new home here in Worcester. https://t.co/GqHLT5WYDv
SenMarkey,I love Mr. Heat Pump and I love what heat pumps are going to do for millions of Americans and for our climate. https://t.co/US2yWCKCbh
SenMarkey,The Taliban’s recently imposed restrictions on women are unacceptable and violate human rights. We should pass my resolution to condemn these abuses and reaffirm U.S. solidarity with women and other vulnerable and minority populations in Afghanistan. https://t.co/984M3WMFjX
SenMarkey,Trump’s presidency was a stress test for democracy and we barely passed. We must pass my REIGN Act to give Congress oversight of secret orders that any future President could invoke in a stated emergency to assume extraordinary and unconstitutional powers. https://t.co/3OHiJpnuan
SenMarkey,"Good. Using the Defense Production Act to support clean energy will make our country safer and more secure for years to come. This means lower prices, independence from Big Oil, stronger homegrown businesses, and a healthier environment for all. https://t.co/rcdesQ8kp4"
SenMarkey,"More tragic gun violence deaths across America last night. I am heartbroken for the survivors and the families who’ve suffered devastating loss. We can’t keep living like this, and Americans can’t keep dying like this. Congress must act."
SenMarkey,The U.S. must continue to stand up for the universal values and human rights of all people and commemorate the brave individuals who suffered that day as well as honor those who struggle for democracy and human rights around the world today.
SenMarkey,"On this anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, we remember the lives lost and the bravery of those who stood up for freedom and human rights in China. Chinese government cruelty persists today in its Hong Kong crackdown, Uyghur genocide, Tibet repression, and censorship."
SenMarkey,Smith &amp; Wesson has contributed more than $1.5 million to the NRA and its lobbying efforts to kill gun safety legislation. Today we stood outside the company's gates to demand an end to the senseless violence that assault weapons unleash all across America. https://t.co/k6goGVtaum
SenMarkey,"Congress needs to expand red flag laws, strengthen background checks, close the gun show and online loopholes, and reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons now. We have to use every tool at our disposal to keep guns off the streets and out of schools. https://t.co/KyotPNPdfL"
SenMarkey,Today is National Gun Violence Awareness Day and I am standing in the shadow of Smith &amp; Wesson—a company that profits from the sale of assault rifles that kill Americans in horrifying numbers—to say enough is enough. We need action on gun safety. https://t.co/mqdn6hJy7W
SenMarkey,"Republicans, big polluters, and their far-right allies have packed the Supreme Court to serve their unpopular agenda. I am proud to be joined by @LCVoters as we fight to expand the Court and overcome this illegitimate, far-right majority to protect our most basic rights. https://t.co/gKs7C4eitM"
SenMarkey,"You might have heard of Smith and Wesson. Their AR-15-style assault weapon was used in mass shootings in Parkland, Aurora, and San Bernardino. Join us live at noon to demand a ban on this weapon of war. #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay https://t.co/FAtz2ZXfhf"
SenMarkey,Thank you to the students and teachers who showed me around the brand new net zero @HosmerSchool in Watertown. May your organizing and clean-energy-powered school be an inspiration to communities across our state and the whole country. Incredible. https://t.co/KG3Px7WyBK
SenMarkey,https://t.co/IEFkZlnYlO
SenMarkey,"I lead my colleagues in calling on Lyft, DoorDash, Grubhub, Instacart, and Uber to do what's right. Workers face significant risks simply by doing their jobs, and at least 50 have died. This is unacceptable. We need transparency, accountability, and honesty from these companies. https://t.co/l9ubRdgz1d"
SenMarkey,https://t.co/WpBJaHqwcS https://t.co/at4gCc86dc
SenMarkey,"Drilling in the Arctic Refuge poses huge risks to the Gwich’in, to threatened Arctic ecosystems, and to our climate. It’s all risk, no reward. Companies are already pulling out of their leases— let’s permanently protect this land. https://t.co/jjcNP37TpF"
SenMarkey,"Thanks to federal funding, students at @SeeRCC are going to rebuild, rename, and repurpose the historic Dudley House and learn the skills they need to design and develop net zero buildings all across Massachusetts. https://t.co/NZVyWFKIWl"
SenMarkey,"I am announcing $4 million for @SeeRCC's ""Reclaim, Rename, Repurpose"" project at the Dudley House, to teach students site assessment, design, carpentry, and electrical work with energy efficiency in mind while developing a new community space. https://t.co/s90TqhnSl3"
SenMarkey,"These companies have refused to grant basic insurance and benefits to their workers, even in the face of death on the job. It’s time they classify their workers as workers and prioritize health and safety over profits here in Massachusetts and across the country. https://t.co/0GGNnX4FNe"
SenMarkey,"Americans are being murdered. Not just today, but every day. There are simultaneous active shootings across our country and a failure to act on gun safety is complicity in the death of thousands of people. It is past time for the Congress to act. I am ready. https://t.co/jt0QEgmAuQ"
SenMarkey,"I am grieving for the victims of the latest mass shooting in Tulsa. Americans deserve to live their lives, see their doctor, go shopping, and go to school without being killed. We must stop gun violence now."
SenMarkey,"The @HosmerSchool in Watertown is the first net zero school in MA and they are proving to everyone just what is possible when you are committed to a just and livable future. I am so grateful for this community who organized so hard to build this historic, clean energy school. https://t.co/B4JEl4NCNZ"
SenMarkey,"The pandemic made clear just how many students and families need internet access to get the education and services they need. Emergency connectivity funding has helped those in Taunton schools get connected, succeed, and lead in internet access. https://t.co/AxrgXKa6wp"
SenMarkey,"I was so happy to join the @EPA yesterday to celebrate the monumental investment in environmental justice and clean air for the people of New Bedford. Together we will deliver clean air, clean water, and a clean economy for all. https://t.co/ZBMRlr2g6Y"
SenMarkey,"This Pride Month, let us honor the brave activists and organizers who fight tirelessly in support of the LGBTQ+ community. I’m with them. LGBTQ+ rights are human rights and we won’t stop fighting until we secure justice, safety, and equality for all."
