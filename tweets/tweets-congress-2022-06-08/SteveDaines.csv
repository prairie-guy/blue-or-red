SteveDaines,"Washington, D.C. has a lot to learn from these Grass Range School students! https://t.co/PRvWDDtsIu"
SteveDaines,The answer is NOT and should NEVER be asking Montanans to spend tens of thousands of dollars on an electric car because @JoeBiden &amp; the Democrats manufactured an energy crisis.
SteveDaines,Cindy and I are extending our heartfelt prayers to the family and loved ones of Navy pilot Lt. Richard Bullock of Montana who tragically died in a plane crash last Friday. We are so grateful for his service. https://t.co/tIC01jW9XH
SteveDaines,.@JoeBiden’s gas price hike is not exclusive to gas — more expensive fuel leads to higher prices for all kinds of goods &amp; services Montana families need.

SteveDaines,"There's no such thing as “cancelling” debt. Biden’s plan just makes hardworking MT taxpayers foot the bill for others' student loans. 

Amid skyrocketing inflation, record high gas prices and crippling food shortages, hasn’t Biden’s incendiary spending cost Montanans enough?"
