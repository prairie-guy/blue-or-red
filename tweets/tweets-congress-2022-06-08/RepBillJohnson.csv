RepBillJohnson,"While this is happening, President Biden is using the Defense Production Act to build more solar panels. For those old enough to remember, it’s starting to feel like the late 1970s all over again. https://t.co/ZiPuWGG2xx"

RepBillJohnson,Newly approved Fentanyl-resistant gloves will better protect first responders in Eastern Ohio from the deadly scourge of this drug. I was glad to help cut through DEA red-tape to secure the materials a local company needed to test the gloves for approval.
RepBillJohnson,Glad to recognize Christopher Altiere this morning at a ceremony put on by his family at Canfield HS. Proud to nominate him to the @AF_Academy https://t.co/kVwSRusioQ
