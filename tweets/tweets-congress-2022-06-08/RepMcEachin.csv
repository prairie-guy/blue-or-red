RepMcEachin,"Last month, I joined my House colleagues in asking @POTUS to resolve U.S. solar energy tariffs to strengthen the domestic solar manufacturing sector. This EO will help the clean energy industry while creating new jobs &amp; lowering energy costs. https://t.co/L79wHXjCHc"
RepMcEachin,I applaud @POTUS's decision to authorize the Defense Production Act to help bolster the production of clean energy technologies here at home. This action will help strengthen our domestic energy supply &amp; reduce costs for hardworking Americans. https://t.co/zbMLqL8q1r

RepMcEachin,"Today, on Gun Violence Awareness Day, I am taking a moment to remember those we have lost to the epidemic of gun violence.

RepMcEachin,I introduced the Firearm Owners Responsibility &amp; Safety Act. The bill mandates the safe storage of firearms &amp; provides victims &amp; their families w/ a private right of action to seek damages from owners who fail to do so. https://t.co/TCNyP0B6w5
RepMcEachin,"@POTUS is right - We need to take action to curb gun violence, and requiring the safe storage of firearms is an important component to ensuring guns do not fall into the hands of people who should not be able to access them. https://t.co/6XuJeIbL3F"
