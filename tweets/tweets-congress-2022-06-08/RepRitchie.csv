RepRitchie,Last week I introduced legislation to expand the publicâ€™s access to participation in the redistrcting process. @RepJeffries and I are committed to amplifying the voice of voters in how they are represented in Congress. Via @ShantRS. https://t.co/UOnN0mPgIr
RepRitchie,"Too many lives have been lost to gun violence in this country. As we #WearOrange to honor victims of gun violence, I am calling on Republicans to finally join  Democrats on common-sense gun legislation to #EndGunViolence."
RepRitchie,Thankful for @FSCDems support on policy that will help uplift the over 1.4 million #LGBTQ owned businesses in this country by preventing and identifying discrimination based on sexuality or gender identity. #PrideMonth https://t.co/MXB3kLvuVx
RepRitchie,"The methodology of the food stamp program has long been disconnected from reality. With food insecurity at an all time high, it's time to modernize SNAP. Every American should have access to food for their families, &amp; we owe this security to the essential workers of the Bronx. https://t.co/eQjwnzmFNO"
RepRitchie,"Reminder on the first day of Gun Violence Awareness Month: While Democrats are passing bills to #EndGunViolence, Republicans can only offer prayers.

@HouseDemocrats know it's time to take action to save lives, they want to take action against doors."
RepRitchie,"As a child in the Bronx living in public housing, I was often too scared to come out of the closet. I so blinded by fear to see my own value, my own equality. This #Pride month, I'm proud to celebrate how far we've come in the fight for equality &amp; recommit to the work ahead. https://t.co/aBQIFNt6jL"
RepRitchie,"#Pride is a time to reflect &amp; celebrate how close we are to realizing the vision of equality. However, the mission is far from accomplished as LGBTQ people remain unprotected from discrimination. This month &amp; every month the @LGBTEqCaucus is committed to fight for equality. https://t.co/SJ8gHqeA1f"
