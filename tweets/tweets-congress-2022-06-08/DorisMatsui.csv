DorisMatsui,"Happy #Pride Month! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
 
I’m proud to stand with the LGBTQIA+ community in Sacramento and across the country — and I’ll continue to work hard in Congress to fight for the rights of all those who love who they love and who are living their most authentic lives. https://t.co/PbqXBGJ47b"
DorisMatsui,No child should ever be scared to go to school. People shouldn’t fear simply going to the grocery store or out to dinner. Continue to be loud. Continue to push for legislation that makes a difference. We can always do more — and let’s continue pushing for change together.
DorisMatsui,"This week, the House began to consider the Protecting our Kids Act — which would raise the lawful age to purchase assault weapons to 21, ban ghost guns, and strengthen storage requirements."
DorisMatsui,"These mass shootings are utterly heartbreaking. But the more shootings we experience, the more my Republican colleagues in Congress dig in against taking real action to address this epidemic. I know here in Sacramento, &amp; across California we do not accept this violence as normal."
DorisMatsui,"Today on #WearOrange Day, I called for immediate action to address the gun violence epidemic in our country. Recently, our community was devastated by the deadliest shooting in Sacramento’s history. Last week, a lone gunman took the lives of innocent children &amp; teachers in Texas. https://t.co/nW81Xmg4gJ"
DorisMatsui,"As we #WearOrange to honor the victims and survivors of gun violence today, I join in urging the Senate to advance House-passed gun legislation supported by a bipartisan majority of Americans. 

We cannot simply accept these incidents are normal. We must #EndGunViolence now. https://t.co/KFAhRNZtTL"
DorisMatsui,"It was wonderful presenting Father Keith B. Kenny Elementary School students, teachers, &amp; staff with a new flag that has flown over the U.S. Capitol! 🇺🇸

I'm honored to represent them in Washington, DC, &amp; thank you to the @CityYearSAC volunteers for assisting in raising the flag! https://t.co/QUE28s6osc"
